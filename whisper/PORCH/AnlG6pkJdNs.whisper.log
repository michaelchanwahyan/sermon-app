[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:30.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.600]   Porsche, how we doing?
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.080]   You look good.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.600]   You look great.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.520]   Hey, thanks for being here.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.960]   It's always fun to be together on an evening like this.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.340]   Special shout out to some Porsche Live locations we have
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.040]   tuning in from all over the nation.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.200]   Special shout out to Porsche Live Indy, Porsche Live Fort
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200]   Worth.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.720]   We're so grateful you guys would be a part of this evening.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.960]   Hey, I'm really excited about tonight.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.560]   I've got to be honest, when we decided
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   to do a series in the book of Colossians, this was--
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.480]   you there, waking up?
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.720]   This was the text of scripture that I
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.800]   felt the most weight concerning.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   And so I'm really eager to get into this,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.960]   but I think it'd be helpful just to set things up with a story.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.520]   So if you ever moved to a new city,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.400]   then you know it can take a bit to figure out
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.640]   your way around town.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.280]   Yes, anybody from out of town that
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.560]   now lives here in Dallas, Texas, what's
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   the way that you figure out the landscape of a new land?
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680]   Like, what do you do?
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.320]   You take notice of different landmarks.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.680]   You do what I did.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.880]   I made the move from College Station, Texas
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.560]   to my first big city ever, which was Houston at the time.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.680]   And so my wife and I broke.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560]   We make our way into Houston, and we're
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.600]   settling into the area.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.560]   And I've never lived in a place that is this large.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.280]   And so I've got to figure out how
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.560]   to navigate the widespread wild of the Bayou City.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.880]   And so what I decided to do is I just start taking note,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.480]   mental notes, of different landmarks
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.880]   that I see around town.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.280]   I look across the skyline, and I see certain structures
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.320]   or buildings that look significant.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.400]   They stand out from the rest of the horizon.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.440]   Or I'm driving through town, and I'll
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.960]   make note of different restaurants or parks that
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.720]   would be unique to that individual space.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.480]   Or as I would go from one place to another,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.760]   I would think about the bridges that I was passing over.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.920]   And these landmarks, they became significant for me
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.600]   because they helped me to figure out the way that--
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.000]   or helped me to figure out where I was in the city.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.720]   Now, as I was doing this, and I was taking mental notes down,
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.560]   there was one landmark that stood out
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.480]   as especially significant because it
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.160]   was graffitied all over town.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.320]   And it was this name of Toe Flop.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.920]   Yes, you heard me correctly.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.880]   Toe Flop was a graffiti name that I found literally
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.920]   everywhere.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.640]   Like, it was on buildings and bridges and byways.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.880]   Like, it was all over the place.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.920]   It was noticeable at first because it was just
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920]   such a unique name.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.080]   But then as I kept driving and I kept seeing it,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.400]   I started to realize, man, this individual, whoever Toe Flop is,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.120]   has really made a business of getting their moniker out there
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.920]   on the rest of the city.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.320]   You see, it didn't take much effort
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.440]   to find that a public piece of property adorned
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.560]   with their unique signature in the city was virtually everywhere.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.000]   So it got me wondering, who is this person?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.200]   Who is the real Toe Flop?
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.760]   Will they please stand up?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.960]   Is it a guy?
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.000]   Is it a girl?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.040]   Is it a group?
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.200]   Who is this person?
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   Are they still on the lam?
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.480]   Have they been caught?
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.680]   Have they fessed up?
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.440]   Are they still out there doing their thing?
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.480]   And so what I began to do is conduct some research, which
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.760]   is very typical of my personality.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.320]   I decided to scour the internet and learn as much
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.200]   about this person as I could.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.880]   And you know what I found?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.080]   What had started in Houston, Texas
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   had spread all over the nation.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.640]   Toe Flop wasn't just in Houston.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.800]   Toe Flop was in Philly, in Queens, and in Atlanta.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.720]   And it was in New Orleans, in Memphis.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.760]   It even made its way all the way across the pond
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.720]   to London itself.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.120]   Whoever this person was had emblazoned their signature
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.280]   all over the watching world.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.520]   This name was popping up everywhere.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.680]   You see, the subculture of contemporary American graffiti
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.960]   writing would put it like this, that Toe Flop
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   had reached a level of ubiquity known as going all city.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.280]   They had transcended one space, and they
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.960]   had moved into all variety of spaces, which is significant.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.320]   Because in most places, graffiti writing
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.000]   is actually illegal, which raised a couple of questions
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.320]   in my mind, because they were still at it.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.800]   The first question of which was, if their anonymity is
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.160]   so important, if they're not willing to fess up who they
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.080]   are, why do they keep doing this?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   Like, why do they keep graffitiing their name,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.000]   putting their identity out there for people to wonder,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.880]   who is this person?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.000]   Like, why take the risk?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.600]   If this is illegal, if it's against the law,
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.120]   why go to the trouble of emblazoning your signature
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.080]   and causing people to ask the second question
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.400]   that I was facing, which was, who are you?
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.000]   Who is the real Toe Flop?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.320]   And will we ever actually know?
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.920]   Well, I can't speak for Toe Flop specifically,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.760]   but here's why I tell you that.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.080]   Because in a similar way, Jesus himself has gone all city,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.560]   but started in Jerusalem, made its way out
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.760]   into Judea and Samaria, and it has spread all the way
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.960]   to the ends of the earth, even here
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.640]   to our own city of Dallas, Texas.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.880]   You see, across cultures, backgrounds, stages of life,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.040]   socioeconomic statuses, and ethnic lines,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.520]   Jesus has been similarly tagging his name
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.320]   across all of creation.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.720]   And he has left people from all backgrounds of life
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.840]   asking the question, who is this guy?
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.080]   Like, who is Jesus?
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.560]   Who is he really?
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.360]   And the good news is, according to the apostle Paul
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.120]   in the scripture we're looking at tonight, we can know.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.960]   We can rightly identify who he is.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Is he just a moral teacher?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.480]   Somebody my parents believed in when I was growing up?
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.000]   Someone that failed me at some point
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   so I stopped following them?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.880]   I hear he's a carpenter.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.400]   Who is he?
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.280]   The apostle Paul, he's gonna tell us.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.560]   He's gonna tell us not only who he is,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.120]   but he's gonna point to the fact
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.160]   that he is something so much more than we realize.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.480]   So just as a reminder,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.680]   as we're looking at the letter of Colossians,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.840]   Paul is writing this letter to a group of young believers
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.960]   that were asking the question,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   okay, I believe in Jesus, now what?
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.400]   Like, I've placed my faith in him.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.160]   What does it look like then for me to ascend in life,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.640]   to experience greater depth of relationship with him
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.560]   and impact in the world?
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.000]   How do I grow in his likeness?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.560]   What is it like for me to move forward
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.200]   and mature as an individual?
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.800]   You see, he was answering a question for them
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.200]   that many of you are probably asking yourself.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.760]   Like, you don't wanna stay as you are, I hope not.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.020]   You want to grow, you want to get better,
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.880]   you want to continue to advance.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.840]   And the reason it's significant
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.800]   for these Colossian Christians,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.440]   and it's significant for us,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.320]   is because the world is prescribing and pressuring
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.280]   a bunch of different solutions to help you get there.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.200]   They know you have a desire, a yearning for maturation.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.240]   And so they're looking at you and saying,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.560]   oh, we can help with that.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.600]   We can fix your problem.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.880]   Just do the things that we tell you to do.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.840]   And so Paul, as he writes to these believers,
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.440]   and he writes to us, he's telling us,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.340]   hey, if you want maturity in life, you need clarity of Christ.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.600]   If you want maturity in life, you need clarity of Christ.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.920]   That's the main idea,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.120]   the big picture of the book of Colossians.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.440]   If you want a fruitful future, hope in the days ahead,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.240]   a deeper experience in life,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.400]   which I think we can all say,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.760]   yes, that's what I want.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.480]   Kyland, you're reading my mail.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.520]   I want a deep and rich, full experience in the future.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.920]   It's found through this man.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.560]   That's what Paul would say.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.120]   Paul wants us to know that when you see him clearly,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.300]   you see yourself more clearly as a result.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.760]   It's like in dating, when you DTR.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.080]   I don't know if y'all ever heard of this,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.360]   or if this is even still a thing.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.640]   DTR means to define the relationship.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.960]   Why is it important to define the relationship?
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.760]   Because where there is an absence of definition,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.460]   there's an abundance of confusion.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.480]   So when Brooke and I were dating,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.260]   just to give you a personal example from my own life,
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.280]   we started out and there was total clarity
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.600]   about what we were doing.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.180]   We were just trying to get to know each other.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.820]   Like we were just spending time.
[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.360]   We were being private and public.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.500]   We were learning each other's stories
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.280]   and figuring out each other's hopes
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.160]   and indulging each other's dreams
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.920]   and thinking about what was ahead.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.880]   We were just getting to know each other.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.720]   And it was great.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.000]   There was total clarity.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.780]   That is until I unexpectedly kissed her.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:29.700]   Then there was no clarity.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.240]   And that was not my best moment.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.620]   Because what happened in the moment that I did that
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.760]   is I absolutely shifted the nature of our relationship.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.540]   We went from just getting to know one another
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.920]   to I don't know what we're doing with each other.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.960]   And so literally not an hour after it happened,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.360]   my beloved bride, she texted me those four dreadful words.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.280]   We need to talk.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.080]   So we did.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.220]   The next day rolled around and she squared up with me.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.540]   And she had a couple of questions.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.560]   One, she wanted to know how we had arrived at that point
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.000]   to which I was able to answer
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.920]   that I had deep unbridled emotions for her.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.520]   But the number two, she wanted to know in light of it,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.780]   where does our relationship now stand?
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.440]   You see, she knew that she deserved clarity.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.840]   And so she was willing to seek out that clarity
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.720]   on what we were so she could have clarity
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.700]   of who she was within that relationship.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.540]   The same is true with God.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.700]   When we see him, we see ourselves.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.060]   We know how we fit into the equation.
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.720]   And so the apostle Paul is looking and he's saying,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.380]   let me tell you who he is.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.700]   Let me lead you through a divine DTR.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.160]   So who is he?
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.920]   Well, it says this in Colossians 1, starting in verse 15.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.160]   It says that he, talking about Jesus,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.180]   is the image of the invisible God.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.460]   He's the firstborn of all creation.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.380]   That word for image here is the Greek word, acon.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.040]   Anybody listen to acon back in the day?
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.440]   He has absolutely nothing to do with this sermon.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.900]   Acon is where we get our English word, icon.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.200]   So what's an icon?
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.800]   An icon, according to the dictionary,
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.560]   is a person or thing regarded as a reflective symbol
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.680]   of something important.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.080]   A reflective symbol of something important,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.440]   which is exactly what Paul is pointing at.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.180]   He's saying that acon doesn't just communicate
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.180]   that God is similar to Jesus or God is like Jesus.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.140]   If Paul wanted to do that,
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.900]   if he wanted to communicate,
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.740]   if he wanted to communicate
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.880]   that they were similar in essence,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.740]   there's a completely different word for that
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.040]   that he could have used.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.600]   But he chose to use this word, acon,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.360]   because he was trying to communicate
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.300]   they are of the same substance.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.320]   They don't just resemble each other,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.840]   they reflect each other.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.040]   So it's like in "The Lion King."
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.800]   How does Simba remember who you are?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.560]   Well, Rafiki takes him and leads him to a pool of water.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   He has him stare down to that pool of water.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.160]   And as he does, what does he see?
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   He sees a reflection of not just himself, but his father.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.660]   He's reminded of his true identity,
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.240]   that he is the one true king.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.360]   And that's what Paul is saying,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.480]   that in Jesus, you get a mirror image to the father,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.940]   that in Jesus, you see a perfect reflection
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.080]   of who God is in essence.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.440]   You see, if you wanna know who God is,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.760]   then you just need to look at Jesus,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.560]   because Jesus is the deity on display.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.480]   He's the deity on display.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.280]   That's the first thing we need to understand about him.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.000]   He is God in the flesh.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.100]   And to believe that he is anything less than that
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.720]   is a complete invalidation of his being,
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.860]   which happens all the time.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.180]   And is in fact, Paul's point right here.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:22.480]   You see, the heretics that Paul is confronting in Colossae,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   they have been propagating this idea that,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.920]   man, you can follow Jesus, but he's not God.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.880]   Like he's fine, he's good, you can spend time with him.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.160]   We'll tolerate him even.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   But if you want like the height of human experience,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.800]   the climax of spiritual ascent,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.700]   what you need is more than he has to offer.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.960]   Like you're gonna eventually need to either add onto him
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.780]   or move on from him, because in their worldview,
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.680]   these heretics in Colossae,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.080]   Jesus was an inferior spiritual being.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.040]   And so Paul's looking at him and he's saying,
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.280]   whoa, that is not the case whatsoever.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.360]   No, Jesus is God.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.280]   And the relevance of that for us is massive
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.040]   because our world is also saying something similar about it.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.000]   Our world is looking at Jesus and being like, it's fine,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.840]   do what you want, you can walk with him.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.480]   But his moral code is a little bit narrow-minded.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.480]   It's fine, you can walk with him,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.960]   but his position on sexuality, it's kind of out of date.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.520]   The world's evolving quick.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.740]   He needs to keep up.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.240]   It's fine, you can walk with him, do what you want.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.120]   But all of his commands and his ordinances,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.120]   they're not really culturally relevant to today.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.660]   They're stuck in the past.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.860]   They need to get with the times.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.400]   You see, we face a similar heresy today
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.020]   that would say Jesus is less than God.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.560]   But to say something like that
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.120]   and to live in light of something like that
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.080]   is to invalidate his very being.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.040]   It's to indignify him as something less than deity.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.880]   It's to look at Jesus and say,
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.340]   he's either other or he is lesser than God.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.140]   And he's not, that's not the case.
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.760]   Like, as we look at Jesus,
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.240]   we know he's not just like a moral example to follow.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.360]   He's not Mother Teresa, he's not Gandhi.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.920]   Like, he's not just a wise teacher
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.320]   or a spiritual prophet to consider like Muhammad or Buddha.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.200]   He's not a revolutionary leader
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.160]   like Spartacus or William Wallace.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   He's more, porch, he's more because he's God.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.940]   Jesus is God incarnate.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.240]   And the scriptures attest to this.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:01.060]   John 1, 18 says, "No one has ever seen God,
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.200]   the one and only son who is himself God
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.320]   and is at the father's side.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.280]   He has revealed him."
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   You see, Jesus has taken the invisible reality of God
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.920]   and given us a visible reflection.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.920]   He reflects all the integrity of God's character
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   and he reveals all the morality of God's nature.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.160]   If you want to know who God is, look at him.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.280]   That's the guy.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.040]   Like some of you here in this room,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.360]   in a space large like this,
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.880]   you have sat and you have wondered,
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.320]   God, if you would just speak to me,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.240]   if you would just reveal yourself to me,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.920]   if you would just show yourself, I believe,
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.960]   like just peel back the clouds,
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.400]   descend into my reality, speak into my world
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.600]   and my belief is yours.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.040]   He has done it.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.720]   God has done it.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.720]   God did descend from the sky that had split
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.380]   and he has spoken into our reality and made himself known
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.920]   because Jesus Christ is God.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.800]   Do you get it?
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.760]   This is massive.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.000]   And your understanding, your comprehension of it
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.400]   is so vital because everything you do in life
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.720]   hinges upon your comprehension of this truth.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:31.740]   So if you want to know God, you need to know him.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.300]   Hebrews 1.3 says, he is the radiance of the glory of God.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.080]   He's the exact imprint of his nature.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.440]   That word for imprint in Greek,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.840]   it's the word (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.220]   in English, it's the word character.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.960]   What does it mean?
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.720]   Literally, it's a noun for an engraving tool,
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.520]   something that you would use to make an impression
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.720]   on something else, which I think is really awesome.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.060]   It's a really helpful word picture
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.960]   because that is the function which Jesus performs.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.400]   Jesus is engraving God's signature on the world.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.520]   Jesus is impressing God's nature to you and to me.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.800]   Like why do star-crossed lovers
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.040]   engrave their initials in the side of a tree?
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.560]   Because it immortalizes their bond.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:29.120]   That no matter what comes, hell or high water,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.840]   the world will know we are one.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.360]   In a similar way, Jesus is the engravement
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.720]   of God's own character.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.160]   He is an immortalized representation to us
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.640]   that we can actually understand.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.660]   But don't you think this is awesome?
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.880]   I was processing this earlier.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.260]   The fact that God has chosen to reveal himself
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.260]   through a person is like the most helpful option available.
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.320]   Like God has revealed himself through this book
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.520]   and God does reveal himself through times past
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.840]   in supernatural means.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.320]   But what we know most clearly
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.620]   is God has made himself known through a person.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.720]   I know how to get to know someone else.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.640]   What do I do?
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.880]   I sit with them, I listen to them, I talk with them,
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.940]   I spend time with them, I walk with them.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.960]   This is the case with Jesus.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.120]   God has said, "I want you to know me."
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.520]   And so what's the best way for you to get to know me?
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.660]   Spend time with my boy.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:30.300]   Spend time with Jesus because he is him.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.080]   They are one in the same.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.860]   Jesus is, he is the deity on display.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.920]   What you'd see of God is what you see in Christ.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.120]   He's the almighty made manifest.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.720]   And as Paul keeps going,
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.000]   he's the firstborn of all creation, which feels confusing.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.720]   Like, can we just level with each other?
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.200]   That feels like a weird swerve.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.040]   God, or Paul just unpacked that Jesus is God.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.340]   And now you're telling me that Jesus is born?
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.980]   Ah, it doesn't sound like a God I really want to follow.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.820]   Why?
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.400]   Because God is not created.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.700]   God is creator.
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.440]   So what's the breakdown?
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.520]   Like, what is the confusion around this idea?
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.120]   Like, Jesus,
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.640]   Jesus is both the image of the invisible God,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.800]   but he is also the firstborn of all creation.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.760]   What does Paul mean?
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.920]   Well, Paul is actually using this to attack a heresy
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.640]   that was hotly debated then
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.460]   and hotly debated through history,
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.600]   that Jesus was a created being,
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.040]   that he was in fact the first created being.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.680]   He was the firstborn being.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.640]   And so Paul is speaking to it and he's saying,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.880]   no, you have a misunderstanding of this.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.520]   It's not that Jesus was created.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.180]   It's that he has preeminence.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.020]   That's what it was.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.080]   If you study through the Old Testament
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.880]   and you look at the language of a firstborn,
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.400]   what you find is it's not specific to birth chronology,
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.160]   the order in which you were born,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.760]   it's specific to like position or rank.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.520]   So let me explain it to you like this.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.720]   If you were to answer the question,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.720]   what is your favorite movie?
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.360]   The equivalent of your firstborn for film
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.000]   would be whatever you answer.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.920]   Your answer would likely not be the first movie
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.520]   you ever saw.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.320]   It would not be the movie that you watched first
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.920]   in order of sequence.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.520]   It would be the movie that you deemed best,
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.200]   preeminent, priority, ranked above the rest.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.320]   If I asked you, what's your favorite meal?
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.440]   The equivalent firstborn food for you
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.500]   would hopefully not be the first thing you ever ate.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.640]   It would be a meal that you deemed as first
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.680]   or priority or preeminent above everything else.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.040]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.440]   And this is what we need to know.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.440]   Jesus is the firstborn in that he is preeminent.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.480]   You see, he wasn't born as we naturally know.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.040]   He has no origin story.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.720]   He has no created being, no start date
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.980]   because he always has been.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.160]   He was, is, and always will be.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.880]   Psalm 90 verse two says,
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.760]   "Before the mountains were brought forth,
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.540]   "wherever you had formed the earth and the world,
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.400]   "from everlasting to everlasting, you were God."
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   Revelation 22, 13 says, "I am the alpha and omega."
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.800]   The first and the last, the beginning and the end.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.940]   And the same is said of Jesus himself.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.360]   John 1,1, "In the beginning was the word,
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.840]   "and the word was with God, and the word was God."
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   Hebrews 13,8, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.700]   "today, and forever."
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.920]   So what does Paul mean when he's saying
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.960]   he's the firstborn of all creation?
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.800]   He's saying that he is,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   he's first place.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.320]   He's preeminent.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.920]   He has the ultimate priority.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.520]   You see, you're firstborn, according to the scriptures,
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.000]   is not decided in order of sequence,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.680]   but in order of supremacy.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.620]   That's what Paul is trying to communicate
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.160]   in calling Jesus the firstborn of creation.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.560]   He is supreme over all creation.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.340]   He is ranked priority, dignity over all of it,
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.440]   which is what Paul explains as he keeps going.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.620]   He gets to verse 16, he says,
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.160]   "For by him, all things were created,
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.700]   "in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.920]   "whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities,
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.640]   "all things were created through him and for him."
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.100]   This verse is telling us that Jesus has
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.920]   three very distinct roles in the creative process.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.120]   It's telling us that all things were created by him,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.900]   through him, and for him.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.660]   To put it in layman's terms,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   he's the designer of creation,
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.380]   he's the builder of creation, and he's the owner.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.060]   He's the cosmological Chip and Joanna Gaines, you know?
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.300]   Like, he's the guy that knew how to set everything up.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.020]   So when he considered creation, it was his idea.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.740]   Like, he designed it, he sat down and he authored it,
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.460]   he dreamt it, he planned it,
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.040]   he mapped out all the blueprints,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.140]   he knew exactly what he wanted it to look like.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.540]   But he didn't just design it, it's not only by him,
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.540]   it's also through him, he's the builder of it.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.420]   So he took his own plans and he took them into action.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.100]   He took a vision and he brought to it execution.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.940]   He decided to implement everything that he had dreamt up
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.800]   when he considered, what do I want creation to look like?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.060]   And then he owns all of it.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.340]   He's the designer and the builder and the owner.
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.420]   What does an owner have?
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.180]   An owner is entitled to all the benefits.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.600]   That that which is subject to your ownership affords.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.920]   Jesus, he receives all the benefits of creation.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.560]   All things were created for him.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.380]   And so all things roll up to his glory.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.160]   That's what he's pointing to.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.360]   Dutch theologian, Abraham Kuyper said,
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.960]   "There is not a square inch in the whole domain
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.520]   "of human existence over which Christ,
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.320]   "who is sovereign over all, does not cry, mine."
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.580]   There's not a square inch.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.220]   Visible, invisible, celestial, terrestrial.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.620]   It does not matter.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.420]   Everything is his.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.100]   It's all his.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.460]   You see, if you wanna see Jesus clearly,
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.580]   what you need to see is that Jesus
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.180]   is the creator of the cosmos.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.560]   He is the deity on display
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.660]   and he is the creator of the cosmos.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.660]   He made everything.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.980]   Like he's the artist of all creation.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.880]   By him, through him, all things were created.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.480]   It's interesting, like the language here,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.720]   if you go and you read in the Greek,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   it doesn't imply that Jesus took some preexisting material
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.280]   and made something out of it.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.680]   It's saying that he took nothing and he made something.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.600]   So for point of reference,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.880]   he didn't just go pick a bunch of wildflowers,
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.360]   bring them back to the house,
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.980]   and make a floral arrangement.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.920]   He didn't just take chaos,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.260]   bring it back to his heavenly home,
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.940]   and order it into control.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.820]   No.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.420]   He invented the seed.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.700]   He thought of it.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.660]   It was his idea.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.340]   He was the one through which it was created.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.540]   He invented the seed and he thought to himself,
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.380]   you know what would make sense?
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.980]   This is crazy, guys.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.680]   We're gonna take it and we're gonna bury it in the ground.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.940]   But wait, it's gonna germinate while it's there.
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.580]   It's gonna lay roots
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.000]   and then it's gonna sprout forth.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.480]   And yet you may think they'll all look the same,
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.700]   but they won't.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.340]   They will be a million in multitude,
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.140]   different shapes and sizes and colors.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.140]   Jesus created something from absolutely nothing.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.060]   There were no raw materials, no natural laws,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.500]   no preexisting ideas.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.020]   In his creative work, this is wild.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.900]   It's anything but a local operation.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.380]   It's a cosmological construction.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.300]   It expands to the furthest reaches of the universe.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.140]   So I was studying this.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.620]   There's a law called Hubble's law,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.560]   which would attest to the fact
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.580]   that according to observed physical cosmology,
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.900]   the universe is in fact still expanding,
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.900]   which would tell us that he's not done making things.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.700]   Jesus is still creating.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.020]   That is NASA attests to this observable law.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.100]   What it says is that all of the universe
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.300]   is still expanding upwards of thousands of miles per second,
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:37.140]   which for the believer, catch this,
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.580]   is amazing because it would say
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:47.460]   that all of creation is still desperately trying to catch up
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.660]   to those first words which were echoed from eternity past.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.760]   Let there be light.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.680]   It's never slowed down.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.940]   It's still burning on the fuel of what was first said.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.560]   That's power.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.040]   And that's Jesus.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.800]   That's what he has to offer.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.680]   That's what he's willing to speak into your life.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.520]   All things were created by him and through him.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.640]   And here's what's crazy.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.840]   All things were created for him.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.200]   So every week, think about it for yourself.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.720]   I was processing it in my world.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.860]   When you sit down and you make a grocery list,
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.280]   how do you assign what goes on the list?
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.000]   Well, it gets on the list
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.200]   because it accords with your desire.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.600]   It's what you want, right?
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.400]   No, it could be a variety of desire.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.560]   Desire by necessity.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.080]   I want to smell good.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.860]   And so I need body wash.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.940]   I want clean teeth.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.580]   So I need toothpaste.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.440]   I want a clean home.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.320]   So I need disinfectant.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.100]   That's desire by necessity.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.540]   But you also have desire by affinity.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.520]   Those things which you want.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.640]   I want ice cream because it tastes good.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.760]   You know, you put on your list,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.760]   that grocery list which you are making for yourself,
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.640]   those things which you desire.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:13.320]   Jesus has created all things for himself
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.160]   according to his own desire,
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.720]   which includes you.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.880]   (silence)
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.960]   Jesus wants you.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.760]   He desires you.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.340]   He looks at you and says,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.660]   "You as you are, as I've made you
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.780]   "and will continue to elevate you to be
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.380]   "is what I want for myself."
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.140]   And yet what we see
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:56.040]   is that in verse 17, he's before all things,
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.780]   which dignifies Jesus with a sort of supremacy
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.660]   that should leave even the most self-confident person here
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.940]   in this room,
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.820]   wondering if they're actually worthy of that kind of desire.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.700]   Verse 17 says, "And he is before all things.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.460]   "And in him, all things hold together."
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.860]   Like that's as transcendent as someone can get.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:17.940]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.260]   Like you don't get bigger than that,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.700]   that you're before all things,
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.000]   that nothing holds a candle to you,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.140]   that nothing is comparable to you,
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.340]   that you are matchless in your essence.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.900]   That is transcendent.
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.300]   And yet that's who our Jesus is.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.740]   So let me just put it to you like this.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:37.460]   Think of the most iconic celebrity in your world,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.200]   like the person that you're desperate to meet one day.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.660]   You got it?
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.620]   Now just imagine that they were desperate to meet you
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.100]   and they knew you were gonna be here tonight.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.780]   And so they flew from wherever it is they live
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.340]   on their private plane,
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:58.260]   and they traveled here to our little location.
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.580]   And they came in knowing
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.980]   you were gonna be in this space somewhere.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.580]   And so they started to scour the seats looking for you
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.500]   because they just wanted to be associated to you.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.100]   They just wanted to meet you.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.900]   How crazy would that be?
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.660]   Whoever that person is that came top of mind for you,
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.760]   Jesus is before them.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.380]   He's above them, beyond them.
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.920]   He is matchless in comparison to them.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.100]   And what's amazing
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:32.520]   is he does want to be associated to you.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:38.860]   He did travel an unbelievable distance to get here tonight.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:44.860]   And he is scouring this room in search of you
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.300]   because he wants a relationship with you.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.260]   How would that leave you feeling?
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:55.340]   Like, how does it make you feel to think like,
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.460]   man, that person who I desire so badly to be associated with
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.260]   and the fact that they want to be associated with me,
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.060]   how would that leave you feeling?
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.620]   Honored?
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.220]   Like, they want little little things.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.540]   Like, they want little old me.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.380]   They want to know me.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.900]   Nervous?
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.460]   But what do I, I didn't know they were coming.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.580]   Like, I need to take time and get myself ready.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.420]   I'm not prepared for this moment.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.380]   Unworthy?
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.600]   But if they knew me,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.140]   they're not going to want anything to do with me.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.340]   Excited?
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.180]   What does this mean?
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.020]   Like, maybe, maybe I'm going to get the hop of the plane
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.920]   and go back with them where they came.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.060]   Friend, whatever that feeling is,
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.260]   that feeling is meant for Jesus.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.780]   He's worthy of all the raw emotion you get
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.780]   at the thought of someone so incomparably great,
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.240]   wanting all of you exactly as you are.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.900]   This is what Colossians is telling us.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.140]   How do I know that?
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.100]   Because that's where Paul goes in verse 18.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.540]   He says in verse 18,
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:03.980]   he's the head of the body, the church.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.000]   He's the beginning,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.940]   the firstborn from the dead,
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.180]   that in everything, he might be preeminent.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.940]   So when you turn to this section, you get to verse 18,
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.420]   it makes a massive shift
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.400]   from where the rest of the passage has been going.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.920]   If you read through these nine verses,
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.660]   you find three shifts, all marked by three verses.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.860]   The first section,
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.060]   which we worked through over the course
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:25.340]   of the last 30 minutes,
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.860]   is verses 15 through 17, 15, 16, 17.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.780]   And it's all talking about Jesus as creator.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.340]   When you come to verse 18, 19, and 20,
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.960]   it's all about Jesus as savior.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.800]   And then when you get to 21, 22, 23,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.040]   it's all about you and your response to these things.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.000]   So as the section opens up,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.720]   we see that Paul, he moves the conversation away
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.760]   from an emphasis on Christ's transcendence
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.560]   into an emphasis on Christ's eminence.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.640]   What does eminence mean?
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.240]   It means a personal knowing.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.800]   Transcendence, he's powerful.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.200]   Eminence, he's personal.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.880]   You can know him.
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.160]   Like he is,
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:11.000]   he is universal in his rule and his reign over everything.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.140]   But as we come to 18,
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:16.780]   we learn that he is individual in his seeking and saving.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:21.120]   Why is that?
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.220]   Because Jesus,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.340]   and this is our third and final identifier for him,
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.480]   is the savior of the world.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.220]   That's what Paul's getting at when he says things like,
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.560]   he's the head of the body, the church.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.400]   He's the beginning.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.480]   He's the firstborn from the dead.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.800]   Like he's trying to help us understand
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.920]   that Jesus isn't just supreme over old creation.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.200]   Everything we talked about,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.100]   everything from the star to the atom,
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.720]   everything from the seen realm to the unseen realm,
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.980]   he isn't just supreme over that, over old creation.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.440]   When we get here and we learn
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.480]   that he's the firstborn from the dead,
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.840]   he's the head of the church,
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.000]   we see that he is supreme over new creation.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.040]   What's new creation?
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.200]   Well, it's what the prophet Ezekiel foretold,
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.840]   which Jesus is the one through whom it's fulfilled.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.600]   It says in Ezekiel 36, 26,
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.520]   I, talking about God, will give you a new heart.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.160]   I'll put a new spirit within you.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.120]   Not an old heart, not an old spirit.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.860]   I'm going to give you a new heart and a new spirit.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.880]   I'll remove your heart of stone
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.560]   and I'll give you a heart of flesh.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.280]   Like that's why he's the head of the body, the church.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.200]   And notice this reads body.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.240]   He's the head of the body, not the head of a building.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:36.080]   Like Jesus did not come to seek and save
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.000]   and sacrifice his life
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.740]   for the sake of some brick and mortar sanctuary.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.940]   No, he came to seek and save and sacrifice his life
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.800]   for the sake of bruised and broken sinners.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.160]   That's why he's come.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.920]   Not because the church is a building,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.120]   but because it's a body and he's the head of it.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.520]   Like, why does he say he's the head?
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.180]   Because wherever your head goes, guess what goes with it?
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.120]   Your body.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.200]   It's just the way it works.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.240]   Your body goes wherever your head does.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.000]   Your head is the governing, guiding,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.760]   deciding force over your human machine.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.400]   So here's what's fascinating.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.920]   You can lose an arm.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.880]   You can lose a leg.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.960]   You can lose an eye.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.000]   And while less than ideal, you can keep going.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   You can keep moving forward, but you lose your head.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.040]   It's all over.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.780]   You ain't going anywhere.
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.540]   The body ceases to move.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.600]   This is how it is for the believer.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.000]   He is our head, disconnected from him.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.480]   We have no movement.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.220]   We have no life.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.260]   The apostle Paul says that in him,
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.620]   we find our living and our being and our doing.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.320]   It's how we move and live and exist.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.140]   Christ is not just the head though.
[00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.120]   He's the firstborn from the dead.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.020]   What does that mean?
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.580]   It means that had Jesus not resurrected,
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.820]   no one is resurrected.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   If he had not gone into that tomb,
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.040]   and then three days later, walk out of that tomb,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.820]   none of us would lie in the grave and rise forth one day.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.320]   He's the firstborn from the dead.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.140]   He's preeminent even over that,
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.920]   not just in life, but in death.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.960]   He has conquered all things.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.160]   You see, Christ is not merely someone who lived and died
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.760]   and whom we read and we learn.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.800]   No, he is the one who arose and is alive forevermore.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.400]   Like he's not a dead hero.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.840]   He's not a past founder.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.400]   He's not a subject of study.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.360]   He is alive.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.800]   That's who God, that's who Jesus is.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.720]   Revelation 1:8 says, "I am the living one.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   "I was dead and behold, I am alive forevermore.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.600]   "And I have the keys to death in Hades."
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.860]   Shouldn't that verse change the way that we engage with him?
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.060]   Like that verse, the fact that he is the one
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.060]   that holds the keys to death in Hades,
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.520]   that should change the way we engage.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.960]   And yet here's the thing,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.660]   to those of you in the room that are Christians,
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:36.020]   it's left us treating Jesus
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.620]   far more like he is our specialty than our reality.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.280]   We walk with Jesus in a way
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.420]   where we have cursory Christian cordial answers
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.060]   whenever someone asks us how life is.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.720]   We know the right things to do.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.820]   And we actually do them
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.460]   because we want to be on the good side of God.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.060]   We have quotable captions that we post out on Instagram.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.820]   We play the religious game.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.020]   And yet here's the thing,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.860]   many of us are hiding the fact that we're actually
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.260]   so very disenchanted with the person of Christ.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.320]   Somewhere along the way, he ceased being God.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.180]   And he just turned into a game.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.560]   He just turned into one that we know a lot about,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.360]   we talk a lot about, and we associate ourselves with.
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:32.500]   But he no longer wildly impacts our day.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:38.000]   Speaking to the Christian in the room,
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.860]   this message for you,
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:45.960]   as we talk about the real Jesus,
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.440]   it is a wake-up call.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.840]   It's looking at you and it's saying, there's more.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.480]   There's more to be had with him.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.040]   There's more to be seen with him.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.480]   There's more to enjoy with him.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.600]   He is preeminent.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.280]   He is supreme.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.480]   He is the one.
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.800]   He is the one.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.960]   He is supreme.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.680]   He is unbelievably incomparable.
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.640]   And he's yours.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:21.540]   That should change everything about the way we walk with him.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.600]   It should lead us out of a desire for intellectual ascent
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.720]   and into intimate connection.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.960]   It should cause us to want to be with him,
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.680]   to enjoy him, to listen, to spend time.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.760]   Because as Paul keeps going,
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:42.040]   what we see is that in him, all the fullness of God,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.720]   the totality of the divine,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   the fullness of the deity was pleased to dwell.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.540]   And through him to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.940]   whether on earth or in heaven,
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.280]   making peace by the blood of his cross.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.880]   Like, here's the point of this passage.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.500]   There is so much more to this man than meets the eye.
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.780]   There's so much more to this man
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.140]   than you will find anywhere else.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.460]   Like, as you scour the earth
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.260]   and you seek after satisfaction,
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.300]   you will not find it the way that you can find it in him.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:22.700]   It's in Jesus that the fullness of life is found.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.700]   That abundant, deep soul satisfaction is available.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.220]   It's not in your job.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.500]   It's not in your relationship.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.380]   It's not in the hope of something happening
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.860]   one day down the line.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.000]   It's in him.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.460]   And the beauty of this passage is it's saying that he,
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.060]   this cosmological Christ,
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.620]   like the supreme savior of the world,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:50.720]   he wants you to find all of that right here with him.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.560]   He wants you to seek and search no longer,
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.760]   but come and be satisfied.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:05.060]   Starting today, how do I know that?
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.140]   Because Paul tells us, he ends this passage,
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:15.040]   that we who were alienated and hostile in mind,
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.440]   doing evil deeds, we've been reconciled through faith.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.340]   We've been reconciled through faith
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.260]   in the death of that deity,
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.300]   of that Jesus who was put on display,
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.240]   hung for the watching world to see.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.520]   We know that we've been forgiven
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.120]   because as he, the creator of the cosmos,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.160]   hung upon a cross, which he himself had created,
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:48.720]   bled out and cleansed us in his own death
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.440]   of all our iniquity.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.400]   And we know that we've been saved
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:59.560]   because by faith in the savior who rose for the sake
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.260]   of sinners like you and me, we can have hope.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.920]   Hope that it is, not maybe, but is going to be better.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:17.480]   That he is the preexistent, preeminent Christ.
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:23.200]   He has been, he is today, and he will always be.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.240]   And where he now sits,
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.400]   he wants to bring you home to himself.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.160]   (gentle music)
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.820]   The question is, now that you see him clearly,
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.580]   what do you see about yourself?
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:44.720]   What's revealed by way of the definition you see
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.460]   marked upon that man, Christ?
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.520]   And what does it lead you to do from here?
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.400]   Let me pray for us.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.440]   Father, God, I just confess,
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:06.200]   I am really so insufficient for this text.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:14.120]   But God, your word is not insufficient to speak.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   I, God, am so unworthy to communicate such wonder.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.880]   Yet you, God, are so loving
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.840]   that you want that wonder to be known even still.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:40.320]   Jesus, you truly are one of a kind.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   You truly are of the highest and best order.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.600]   There really is no one God that compares.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   And so, God, I just pray that here, now,
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.400]   in this moment, God,
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.800]   we might be willing to lay down whatever it is
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.440]   we've looked at you and said, "That's better.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.880]   "This is preferred.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.400]   "I want that instead."
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.800]   Would we surrender those things to you tonight?
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.120]   And would we see, God, in you
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:20.380]   the fullness of God in the image of the Son?
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.920]   And as we see you clearly, God, right now, in this moment,
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.800]   as your spirit works, moves, and speaks,
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.240]   would we be sensitive to the clarity
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.680]   it's trying to bring to us about ourselves?
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:39.960]   Oh, God, we're so unworthy
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:45.720]   of one as highly exalted as you
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.360]   that would condescend here to this earth below,
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:55.720]   taking on our likeness, becoming like us,
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.960]   dying the death we deserved,
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.440]   and rising forth a new life that we, God,
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.480]   we might become like you.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.920]   We respond to you now in light of this good news.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.880]   It's in Jesus' name, amen.
