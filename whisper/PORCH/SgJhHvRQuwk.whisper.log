[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.760]   I want to start with a question for you.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.840]   Have you ever tried out for something
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.480]   and had to wait to find out if you got in?
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.240]   Okay, like you're like in that waiting,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.120]   like I don't know if they've accepted me,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.320]   I don't know if I'm getting in.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.200]   And so maybe it was a date, right?
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.120]   You go on a date and the date's over
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360]   and he's like, I'll call you.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.240]   And you're like, okay, when?
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   When are you gonna, like, did it go?
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.080]   I thought it went well, did it go well?
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.600]   It seemed like it went well, you know?
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.560]   Or maybe you went on a date and you texted her
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.680]   and it's like, hey, had fun, love to hang out again.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.100]   And you see those three dots and then they disappear.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.720]   And you're like, what's up with that?
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.760]   Like, and you're waiting to find out
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640]   if you've been accepted.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840]   And maybe it was, you know, applying for a college, right?
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.360]   So maybe you apply at your favorite university,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.880]   you send in your application to A&M
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.440]   and you're waiting to see if you, whoops,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.080]   you're waiting to see if you got in
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.520]   or maybe it was Baylor, right?
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760]   Or maybe UT.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.040]   They accept everybody, they accept everybody.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.800]   And you're waiting, you're waiting to find out
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.560]   if you got in, if you got accepted.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520]   Or maybe it was a job interview, right?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.280]   You finish the interview, you put on your best,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.560]   you know, you did everything you could
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.960]   and you leave and it's just that waiting period.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660]   Was I good enough, did I say the right things?
[00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.000]   I wonder how many people they're gonna take in.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.800]   Am I gonna get in?
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.880]   Will they accept me?
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.720]   I went to an interview once,
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.040]   it was actually for a reality show
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.880]   called "The Apprentice," okay?
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.200]   Now I don't know if you've heard of "The Apprentice,"
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.320]   but I tried out for this, it was in Fort Worth,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.680]   tryouts were in Fort Worth.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.760]   And so my wife and I go out there,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.440]   it was a while ago, long before ministry
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.200]   or a little bit before ministry.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.600]   And so that's why I'm in ministry.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.640]   And so I go out there to Fort Worth
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.920]   and there's thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.000]   of people trying, I'm like, I don't have a shot, you know?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.760]   And I go in there and I did everything I could,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   you know, I was bold and had my best suit on
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.120]   and was trying to get on the show.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.480]   And afterwards they said,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.120]   "Hey, we'll let you know today if you made it."
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360]   And so Monica and I went out in Fort Worth,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   we went to Sundance Square, we had a blast,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.640]   just we went and saw a movie.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.200]   I remember we went to Barnes and Nobles,
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.900]   then we went to this comedy club
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600]   and then we were hanging out for a late dinner.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.120]   And I say late dinner 'cause the sun had set
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.140]   and I still didn't get a call.
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.480]   And I'm like, I wonder if I got in.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.040]   And then at like 11.55 at night,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.240]   they said they'd let me know that day,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.800]   they called and they said,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.900]   "Hey, you made it to the next round."
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.880]   And I'm like, this is crazy
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.920]   because this is life changing, right?
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.080]   This is like, we're gonna move to New York
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.440]   and I'm gonna be on this show
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.080]   and this could just be crazy for me.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.800]   And so I go back to the second interview, the callback,
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.840]   and it was in this hotel.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.720]   And I remember kind of going through the same thing,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.060]   this time it was on camera
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.820]   and I was answering these questions.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.180]   And they said, "All right, we'll let you know something."
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.900]   They're like, "We'll call you."
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.320]   And I'm like, "You'll call me when?
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.540]   "When are you gonna call me?"
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.700]   And I just remember that waiting period thinking,
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.940]   hey, my whole life is in their hands.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.620]   My whole future's in their hands.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.900]   And they're gonna let me know what my future looks like.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.180]   I don't know if you've ever had this experience.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.820]   Maybe it was just a job interview.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.740]   Long story short, I didn't make it
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.280]   past that second round.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.140]   Oh, I know.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.300]   But I think this is how we, at some subconscious level
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.380]   in the back of our minds, feel about heaven.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.500]   It's like, hey, it's this place.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.140]   Can anybody really know if you go there
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.880]   what you need to do to get there?
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.940]   Maybe all roads lead there.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.420]   If you follow your religion well, you get there.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.260]   What about the person who's never heard?
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.460]   If I'm saved, am I always saved?
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.040]   Can you lose your salvation?
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.500]   All of these things, like how do I know
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.140]   that I'm going to get to heaven?
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.740]   So we're in this series asking for a friend,
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.780]   and tonight is can anyone really know
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.860]   they're getting into heaven?
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.420]   Can anyone really know they're getting into heaven?
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.840]   And so much more is at stake with this question
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.060]   than just the uneasiness of wondering
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340]   if you got a job or not.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.380]   Or a second date or not.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.260]   Or into a university or not.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.540]   And in fact, the largest belief amongst our peers
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.060]   is that all roads lead to heaven.
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.860]   And so this comes from Jen Iy, these stats.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.820]   It says, although 65% classify themselves as Christians,
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.540]   43% said it doesn't matter what religious faith you follow
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.380]   because they all teach the same lessons.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.460]   70% of all major Christian
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.500]   and non-Christian religious groups say
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.460]   many religions can lead to eternal life.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.020]   And 68% say there's more than one true way
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.620]   to interpret the teachings of my religion.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.380]   68%.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.940]   50% believe that all people are eventually saved
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.660]   or accepted by God no matter what they do.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.540]   Theology called inclusivism.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.900]   We covered universalism.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.200]   This idea that everyone gets there.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.800]   Some people believe, well, pretty much,
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.400]   you just need to be good and you're good with God.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.180]   Right?
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.220]   One way to heaven is too exclusive.
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.320]   I mean, that can't be true.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.980]   Can't all roads eventually lead to God?
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.160]   What about people who never hear?
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.620]   What about people of other faith who are sincere?
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.460]   I remember when I had a crisis of the faith,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.340]   God actually used this
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.960]   to bring me into a relationship with him.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.140]   I thought, what are the odds
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.800]   I'd be born to the right country?
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.540]   I was thinking about this, I was wrestling with this.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.460]   I was like, I know there's a God,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.500]   but I don't know who he is.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.980]   It was agnostic.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.420]   I was like, if I was born in India, I'd be Hindu.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.560]   If I was born in China, I'd be Buddhist.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.420]   If I was born in Iran, I'd be Muslim.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.820]   If I was born in Israel, I might be Jewish.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.140]   And so what are the odds that I'd be born to America
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.820]   and that that would be the right religion?
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.300]   And so I really began to research it
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.100]   with a bias against Christianity.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.320]   And I don't know if your faith is just your parents' faith.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.800]   I don't know how you came to a belief in Jesus Christ
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.840]   if you have, but I pray you sincerely wrestle with it
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.480]   if you haven't.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.200]   As we dive into this message
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   that you'd have a greater understanding
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.360]   of this way, the scripture says.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   And so as we move through John chapter 14,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.320]   we're going to look at how Christianity is exclusive,
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.500]   how Christianity is inclusive.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.040]   And before you leave here this evening,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   how Christianity offers certainty for you.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.960]   And so what's happening in John chapter 14,
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.920]   I'll start in verse one.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.160]   And in chapter 13, Jesus is saying,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.660]   "Hey, I'm going to go somewhere."
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.640]   And his disciples say, "Well, where are you going to go?
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.200]   "Where, why are you leaving us?"
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.080]   And Peter like bows up to him, you know,
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.280]   'cause Peter's crazy.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.580]   And he's like, "Jesus, hey, wherever you go, I'm going.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.020]   "You're not going anywhere without me.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.240]   "Take me with you."
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.500]   And Jesus is like, "Calm down, boys, calm down.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.900]   "Listen, do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.820]   "You believe in God, believe also in me.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.440]   "My father's house has many rooms.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.480]   "If that were not so, I would have told you,
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.840]   "would I have told you that I am going there
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.900]   "to prepare a place for you.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.820]   "And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.100]   "I will come back and take you to be with me,
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.740]   "that you also may be where I am.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.060]   "You know the way to the place where I'm going."
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.820]   And now Thomas speaks of, this is Doubting Thomas,
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.960]   "Wait, wait, wait, Lord, no, we don't.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.300]   "How do we know?
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.260]   "We don't know where you're going.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.180]   "How would we know how to get there?"
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.420]   And Jesus answered,
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.220]   "I am the way,
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.300]   "and the truth,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.160]   "and the life.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:29.660]   "No one comes to the Father except through me."
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.460]   So we're gonna look at this passage
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.540]   and we'll work backwards.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.600]   My first point from the text is that Christianity
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.660]   is exclusive.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.660]   That means there is one way to heaven,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.260]   and his name is Jesus.
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.780]   To believe that the Bible is true
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.740]   is to believe that Jesus is the only way to God.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.980]   And we really spelled this out in the Afterlife series,
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.340]   but I just want you to hear from me.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.520]   There's two eternal destinations.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.200]   Everyone will live somewhere forever.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.420]   There's hell and there's heaven, okay?
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.800]   Those are the only two eternal destinations that exist.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   And Jesus came here, he lived a perfect life,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.540]   and he died the death that we deserve,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.180]   paying the price for our sins.
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.860]   He rose from the grave,
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.380]   and if we accept that payment for our sins,
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.020]   then we can be with him in his kingdom
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.900]   forever and ever and ever,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.500]   and his kingdom is heaven.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.020]   And so in hell, we suffer for our sins,
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.660]   and we don't have to suffer for our sins
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.000]   if we believe that Jesus suffered for our sins.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.560]   And so you say, well, I believe essentially
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.760]   all religions lead to God.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.520]   Different paths up the mountain.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.320]   Aren't we kind of looking at the same thing
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   from different perspectives?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.640]   Anybody ever heard this?
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.200]   Anybody ever heard someone say this?
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.440]   I believe always.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.820]   Lydia, if you've shared your faith,
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:03.640]   you've bumped into this objection before.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.040]   You've never heard anyone say this
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   who has actually studied world religion.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.620]   Okay, this is the statement of naivety.
[00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.040]   It is from someone who hasn't looked at
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.440]   what actual the world religions teach.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.360]   And so let me just show you quickly, as quickly as I can,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.740]   we'll start with Islam.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.760]   This comes from the two holy books,
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.000]   or the holy book of Islam, the Quran,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.340]   and from two different chapters.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.300]   The first one is from the Ali Imran, chapter three,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.080]   verse 85, it says this.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.320]   Whoever prefers a religion other than Islam,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.080]   it shall definitely not be accepted from him,
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.800]   and in the hereafter, he shall be among the losers.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   This is from the Al-Maida, chapter five, verse 72,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.080]   and it says this.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.920]   Listen.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.120]   They have certainly disbelieved who say Allah
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.440]   is the Messiah, the son of Mary.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.000]   It's very specific.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.520]   Allah has forbidden him paradise,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.600]   and his refuge is the fire.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.400]   Whoever believes that God is the son of Mary
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.000]   is going to hell, and Jesus is God, the son of Mary,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.440]   and they can both be true.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.200]   That's nonsensical, it's illogical, it makes no sense.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.320]   Hinduism, right, says this.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.080]   This is from Krishna, the Hindu force of the universe,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.720]   speaking from their holy book, the Bhagavad Gita.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.960]   It says this.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.120]   Those who are without faith in my teaching
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.480]   cannot attain Krishna or the enlightenment.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.880]   I permeate all the universe in my unmanifest form.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.760]   All beings exist within me.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.200]   If you do not accept this view, that you do not exist,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.960]   you will never achieve Hindu salvation.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.500]   And not only is the path different,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.840]   but the destination's different,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.700]   in that Hindus don't believe in heaven,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.760]   but reincarnation, that you would come back
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.040]   as a person of nobility, or a rat,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.760]   or some sort of animal in between.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.580]   So you not just have different paths,
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.920]   but different destinations.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.000]   You say those are both right, both true.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.720]   Hold on, am I going to heaven,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.560]   or am I going to come back to life as someone else?
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.960]   What's true?
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.760]   Buddhism, but that's inclusive, right?
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.560]   Buddhism is inclusive, is the only path.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.160]   There is none other for the purification of insight.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   Walking upon this path will make an end of suffering.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.360]   This is from the Buddhist holy writings.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.540]   Oddly enough called the way.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.340]   And then in the Jewish tradition,
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.280]   exclusivity manifests in the concept of the chosen people,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.580]   in which anyone who does not accept the teachings
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.360]   of Jewish monotheism is excluded
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.920]   from the messianic world to come.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   They are exclusively God's people.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.840]   And so what I want you to see, friends,
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.000]   is Christianity is indeed exclusive.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.480]   Every world religion is indeed exclusive.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.280]   And so to say that they're all right out of love
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.600]   is really to say that they're all wrong.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.040]   If you say anyone who says, well, they're all right,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.340]   hasn't looked at them.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.720]   It's to say that they're all wrong.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.400]   It is a statement, as I said, of naivety.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.920]   And so why do we get to this place where we're like,
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.040]   well, I just think everyone gets to God someday.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.940]   I'll tell you why.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.680]   'Cause you've been sitting on the back of a tailgate
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.420]   after a couple of shots of Patron,
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.040]   been drinking, everybody becomes deep theologians
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.600]   at three in the morning, okay?
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.180]   Like that's when it's like, I love you, man.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.020]   I love you too.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.360]   I know we just met, man, I love you.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.160]   You know who else loves you?
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.720]   God loves you, man.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.960]   He wouldn't send you to hell.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.460]   Nope, not you.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.180]   I think everybody gets in, man.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.680]   Everybody just seems right.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.620]   That's what we do.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.840]   That's what we do.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.440]   And what's it birthed out of?
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.680]   What book you point to?
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.760]   What ancient writings?
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.200]   What person came from heaven,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.480]   came here and told you that?
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.480]   Your feelings.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.040]   Well, I just feel.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.480]   I just think, right?
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.600]   I just, and it's all like in the statement
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.520]   of higher education.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.480]   No, it's not.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.040]   It actually doesn't make sense, right?
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.560]   And the problem with these feelings is Proverbs 14, 12,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.840]   which says there's a way that seems right to a person.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.800]   There's a way that feels right to a person,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.280]   but in the end, it leads to death.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.500]   Where else can you give somebody instruction?
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:35.800]   And they're like, hey, how do I get to your house?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.060]   Like, oh, just pick a road, man.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.480]   You'll get there one way.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.740]   Like that doesn't, that logic doesn't stretch to anything.
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.480]   I was in London recently,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.840]   David and I both were in London together
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.880]   and we didn't rent a car.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.760]   We took the tube.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.320]   The tube is the subway in London,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.620]   the underground railroad and underground railway in London.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.720]   And so we took the tube from the airport to the hotel
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.740]   and that's how we navigated London.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.760]   Now the tube, this subway is very complex in London.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.640]   I don't know if you've been there,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.080]   but the reason I think it's more complex than New York
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.860]   because there's layers, like you go underground
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.480]   and there's stories upon stories,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.840]   upon stories, upon stories of trains.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.040]   And so you have to know what floor to be on first.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.320]   And then when you choose the right floor,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.520]   you have to be know which train to go
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.840]   to take you to the next stop,
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   to get on the next floor, to take you to the train.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.660]   And so like you go, I think we have a picture.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.740]   So that's just like, there's just escalators
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.080]   upon escalators underneath the ground
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.340]   where you're trying to find the right floor.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.620]   And so I'm with David and we're trying to figure out
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:37.520]   what's the right floor,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.180]   because now we've been in London for several days
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.100]   and it's time to go home to catch our plane
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.620]   to see our family.
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.020]   And so we got to find the right train
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.380]   to take us to the airport so that we can go home
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.340]   and see our family and that we can make our flight, right?
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.660]   And so I'm there with him.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.740]   I'm not very smart.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.920]   I'm like, I don't know what floor.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.000]   David's pretty smart though.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.200]   He didn't know what floor.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   And so we walk up and we're looking at this map.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.280]   We finally think we found the right floor,
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.360]   but then there's this map here and I'm looking at it.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.200]   I just gave up.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.540]   I'm like, dude, I don't know, man, you figure that out.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.080]   And he's looking at it, right?
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.020]   And we're just kind of a little bit stressed
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.200]   because the flight, we're supposed to be there
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.880]   ahead of time, it's international.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.160]   And I'm like, we're going to miss our flight.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.240]   I want to see my girls.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.320]   Now imagine if you came up to me
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.040]   and you loved me, man.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.780]   You really, really cared about me.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.020]   And you saw that I was distressed.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.060]   So you said, JP, bro,
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.380]   any of these trains will get you to the airport.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.060]   You know what I'm going to say to you?
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.900]   I'm going to give you a hug.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.180]   I'm going to be like, if I believe you,
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.060]   I'm going to be like, man, that's amazing truth.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.340]   Thank you so much.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.820]   That really helps me because I was distressed.
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.780]   I was thinking I wasn't going to see my wife and my kids
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.860]   and I miss them.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.780]   Thank you so much.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.300]   Now I get on the next train
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.200]   because any of them are going to take me there.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.240]   And some of these trains,
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.480]   they're straight shots to rural England.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.360]   And so I get on it, it has no stop.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.880]   It just takes me way, way, way out
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.760]   in the countryside of England, right?
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.320]   And I get off and there's no train back until the next day
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.640]   because that's how this works.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.680]   I've missed my flight.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.120]   It's cost me thousands and thousands of dollars,
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.360]   thousands and thousands of dollars to rebook.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.640]   I don't get to see my family.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.040]   I don't know when I'm going to get home.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.940]   And all of the sudden,
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:26.460]   what I thought brought me relief was incredible deception.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.760]   And it wasn't loving.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.180]   It was not loving.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.680]   You did not care well for me.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.820]   What you said didn't make sense.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.100]   It was birthed out of your own emotions
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.760]   and it put me in a bind.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.940]   You can imagine when we're talking about
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.540]   an eternal bind, right?
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.060]   And so somebody says,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.060]   well, I believe all religions will get there.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.560]   You just respond to them like this,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.720]   really, well, which one have you chosen?
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.260]   Because like, right,
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.460]   if you think all religions will get there,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.660]   you're going to research them all
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.380]   and try to find the easiest one, right?
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:05.840]   I mean, anyone who truly believes
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.900]   all religions will get you there,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.300]   they're going to choose Christianity
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.380]   because all the other ones are like,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.300]   hey, do this and do this and do this and do this.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.900]   Christianity is like, God did this.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.200]   Like, I'll take that one.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.560]   God loved me enough to allow a son to die for me
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.240]   so that I can be with him forever.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.080]   I'll go that one.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.640]   So which one have you chosen?
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.200]   Anyone who says all religions will get you there
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.920]   hasn't chosen one, right?
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.760]   That's what you see.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.800]   That's the truth.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.080]   So the reality is all religions lead to hell
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.960]   except one that takes you home.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.760]   His name is Jesus.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.480]   I've given my adult life to researching this.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.480]   I found that to be true.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.040]   I've looked at the archeology,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.280]   the history of religions, where they originated.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.580]   Don't take my word for it.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.380]   You do your research.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.920]   You look into it.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.840]   You come to a place where you found it to be true.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.720]   Jesus says, "My father's house has many rooms.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.920]   "If that were not so, would I have told you
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   "that I am going there to prepare a place for you?"
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.240]   My second point from this text
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.120]   is that Christianity is inclusive.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.480]   Now that contradicts that it's exclusive, right?
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.080]   The reason I say it's inclusive
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.440]   is because everyone is invited.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.540]   We've already determined that all religions are exclusive,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.840]   but here's what you need to know.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.280]   Christianity is the most inclusive,
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.320]   that Christ says, "Hey, come."
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.200]   That God is not slow in keeping his promises.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.520]   As some understand slowness, but he's patient with you,
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.320]   not wanting anyone to perish,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.600]   but everyone to come to eternal life.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.480]   That Christianity through Christ is an invitation.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.840]   Like in fact, if you go home tonight and you can do this,
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.080]   Google, "How do I convert to?"
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:54.040]   Google's gonna auto-fill Hindu faith,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.080]   Islam,
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.160]   Jehovah's Witness,
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:04.440]   any religion that's out there, right?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.080]   The Jewish faith, Buddhism,
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.200]   and what you're going to see, friends,
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.120]   is strive, strive, strive,
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.480]   strive to achieve nirvana,
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.280]   strive to achieve enlightenment,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.440]   strive to not want,
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.800]   strive to do enough good deeds
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.180]   so that you can come back as a person of nobility,
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.480]   strive to follow the law of the Old Testament,
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.860]   strive to comply with the five pillars of Islam,
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.800]   strive, strive, strive, strive.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.240]   You work your way up to God for a chance to get in.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.280]   You don't know if you're getting in or not.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.080]   You do everything you can.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.160]   You take a Hajj to Mecca.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.000]   You pray several times a day.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.800]   You do everything you can for a chance to get to God,
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.680]   and yet Christianity says that God loved you so much
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.320]   that he came here.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.400]   Every other religion, you're working your way up.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.280]   Christianity, God says, "I'm coming to you.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.440]   "I'm gonna save you."
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.240]   And he came to the earth in the form of a man, Jesus Christ,
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   2018 years ago in an event that reset the calendar,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.600]   and you acknowledged it.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.360]   Every atheist in the room acknowledges it
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.800]   by the date they put on their checks today
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.400]   or the date in their Microsoft Outlook.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.640]   Right, and we know this because of this book
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   that's been passed down, written over 1,500 years
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.500]   with one central message, 66 books, really,
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.240]   40 different authors, telling one story
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.120]   of God coming to save us.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.720]   By the way, it's been the bestseller this year, last year,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.260]   every single year, and the bestseller
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.400]   in the history of history, this book.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   The second place is a far distant margin, this book.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.480]   That God, you research it, you look into it,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.340]   you grow your confidence in it.
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:57.780]   God said he loved the world.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.560]   Most famous verse in the scriptures, John 3, 16,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.680]   "For God so loved the world,"
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.060]   the Greek word there is the cosmos.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.780]   It's the universe and its inhabitants,
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.920]   is how it's translated.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.360]   "For God so loved the cosmos
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.460]   "that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:20.360]   "that whoever or whosoever or anyone who believes in him
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.960]   "shall not perish, not go to hell,
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   "not die an eternal death, but have eternal life."
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.140]   That's what I want from you, is eternal life.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.140]   I was at a birthday party a couple weeks ago here in Dallas.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.220]   There's a restaurant called Javier's in uptown.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.860]   We were there, we're sitting on the patio,
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.300]   some friends, lots of friends, actually big table.
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.120]   And one of the couples had to leave early.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.180]   And so they were leaving.
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.460]   And so what he did was he just left a wad of cash
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.500]   on the table and he said, "Hey, I got everyone."
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.620]   He said, "I'll pay for everyone."
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.940]   Which I was like, that's kind, okay.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.180]   I'm not going to argue with you.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.900]   And so then he leaves, right?
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.400]   And he texts and says, "Hey, I left money there.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.980]   "Everyone's covered."
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.440]   And so the money's there on the table.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.860]   The guy starts bringing the checks
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.380]   and you're faced with the decision,
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.820]   is my meal paid for or not?
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.180]   There's enough, more than enough money to cover you.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.140]   And this is the same predicament,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.660]   the same dilemma that you face with Jesus.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.660]   Jesus died to pay for your sins and you get a choice.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.260]   Do I accept his payment or do I reject his payment?
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.260]   Do I say, "Hey, that was for me, for my sins,
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.580]   "past, present and future, everything that I've done wrong."
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:49.180]   Or do I reject it and leave it on the table?
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:55.080]   And say, "No, I choose to willingly suffer for my own sins."
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.000]   Christ's payment was enough.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.700]   And see, what I want you to see here
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.060]   is that Christianity is not about what you do,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.740]   but rather what Jesus did.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:12.740]   And the way that Jesus paid invites us all to be saved.
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.480]   The way that Jesus paid invites us all to be saved.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:22.060]   And so what about the one who's never heard?
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.460]   The infamous Bushmen in Africa.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.360]   Man, this used to be a big hangup for me.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.100]   Like I really struggle with this 'cause I'm like,
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.660]   "Man, it just doesn't seem fair.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.940]   "There's people out there that's never,
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.900]   "they've never heard the gospel."
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.800]   This was a big stumbling block for me.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.640]   Until I went to Africa.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.820]   And I went to the Masai Mara,
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.420]   literally the African jungle, that's where I'm at.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.220]   I mean, here's a picture of when I was there.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.540]   And those people are not in uniform.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.220]   Like that's where they live.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.060]   That's who they are.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.260]   They live out there in the African bush.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.040]   And I'm out there with them.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.220]   And this lady sees me from across the way,
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.100]   has this big, beautiful smile.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.100]   And she comes up to me and she says,
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.340]   in the broken English, she says,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.180]   "Can I ask you a question?"
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.140]   I said, "Yeah, ask me anything."
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.980]   She says, "Are you saved?"
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.580]   And I said, "Well, what do you mean by saved?"
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.140]   'Cause I'm thinking she doesn't mean what I think
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.260]   when somebody says, "Are you saved?"
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.740]   I'm like, "Am I saved from lions or what?
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:19.940]   "I don't know."
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.620]   And she says, "Are you saved?
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.660]   "Are you a Christian?"
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.220]   And I said, "Yes, I am a Christian."
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.420]   And she said, "Oh, me too, I'm a Christian too."
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.100]   I said, "How did you become a Christian out here?"
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.720]   And she said, "Well, I've always believed in God.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.860]   "And God has always spoken to me in my dreams.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.660]   "And one day he told me in my dream,
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.340]   "this is my son, Jesus Christ.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.460]   "He has died for your sins.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.860]   "And he has risen from the grave
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.300]   "so that you can be with me forever."
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.060]   And I looked her in the eyes and I didn't flinch.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.180]   I said, "Oh, I understand a missionary came here
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.880]   "and shared the gospel with you.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.820]   "And then you had a dream about it."
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.780]   And she looked at me like I was crazy.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.780]   And she said, "No missionary came here."
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.980]   And I said, "Well, how did you know his name was Jesus?"
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.020]   And she said, "That was his name in my dream."
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.380]   And I said, "I'm done, worried about the Bushmen in Africa."
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.220]   Can I tell you something?
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.100]   I've been in ministry 12 years.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.740]   I've heard the same story from Iran.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.380]   I was on the phone once or on a show once
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.220]   and a 12 year old girl called in
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.780]   and I was sharing my testimony.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.100]   And she called him from Iran and said,
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.820]   "That guy that he's talking about,
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.060]   "I dreamt about him last night.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.100]   "What do I need to do to accept him as my Lord and Savior?"
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.880]   And I've read an entire book from an author I trust,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.500]   all about people coming to the faith
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.780]   through dreams and visions.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.380]   So to the person who says,
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.460]   "What about the one who's never heard?"
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:56.140]   They're just trying to get a pass for themselves, right?
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.700]   Hashtag, I'm asking for a friend.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.540]   What about the one who's never heard?
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.780]   And what about you?
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.620]   What about the one who's never heard?
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.500]   Go tell them.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.540]   Go tell them, spend your life telling them,
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.460]   finding them and telling them,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.020]   sharing the truth of eternal life with them
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.020]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.040]   Why wouldn't you tell them?
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.380]   And you say, "Well, how do I know?
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.720]   "Like, can I know that I'm going to heaven?
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.980]   "How do I know that I'm going?"
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.500]   How do you know anything?
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.140]   What do you trust in?
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.500]   How do you gain information?
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.340]   What do you look at?
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.380]   Where do you find your facts?
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.840]   Jesus says, "Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.240]   "You believe in God, you believe in God,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.080]   "so also believe in me.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.280]   "I go and prepare a place for you.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.180]   "I will come back and take you to be with me,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.220]   "that you also may be where I am.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.180]   "You know the way to the place where I am going.
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.580]   "I'm telling you, I'm telling you the way."
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.820]   My third and final point is that Christianity is certain.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:56.020]   You can be sure.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.820]   You can be sure.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:03.180]   If you've been here long at all,
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.780]   you know that I like to share the gospel
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.060]   by asking two questions called the Kennedy questions.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.780]   And this first question I want to ask to you,
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.260]   between one and 10, 10 being certain,
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.100]   one being not so sure,
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.660]   if you were to die today,
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.340]   how certain are you that you would go to heaven?
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.100]   10 is certain, one's not so sure.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.960]   If you died today,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.700]   how certain are you that you would go to heaven?
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.540]   If you're taking notes,
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.540]   go ahead and write down your number.
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.180]   If you have your phone, why don't you punch it in there?
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.020]   I'd love for you to identify your number.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.140]   How certain are you?
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.020]   You think, you don't have to share it with anyone.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.500]   Just right now, how certain are you
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.900]   that you would go to heaven?
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.400]   (pause)
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.480]   Okay, I'm going to ask you to do something, okay?
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.340]   What I'd love for you to do,
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.620]   I'd love for everyone to close their eyes.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.180]   Now I'm up here, I'm watching your purse,
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.780]   you know, it's okay.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.860]   If you would close your eyes for just a minute,
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.700]   for just a minute.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.460]   Now I'm going to ask you to raise your hand.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.540]   If you were one to five, would you raise your hand?
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.780]   If you were one to five, okay,
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.580]   I see several hands, lots of hands.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.900]   One to five, raise your hand.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.740]   I'm looking around.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.700]   Okay, several of you are one to five.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:15.700]   All right, okay, if you were six or seven,
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.620]   raise your hand.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.260]   Okay, lots of sixes and sevens.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.420]   I see you, I see you, lots of, okay.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.280]   All right, thank you.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.100]   If you were eight or nine, raise your hand.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.940]   Wow, okay, a lot, lots of eights and nines.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.020]   Okay, upstairs, okay, I see you, eights and nines.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.940]   All right, you can come back with me now.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.940]   Thank you for that.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.340]   For humoring me with that.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.660]   I'm going to come back to that in just a minute.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:51.740]   I know I said that the vast majority of world religions,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.940]   they teach a striving, a working your way up to God,
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.020]   but also an uncertainty.
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.620]   That after all of your striving,
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.840]   you're left with a question mark.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:03.220]   You don't really know if you got in or not until you die.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.220]   And this fear allows religious leaders to rule you.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.780]   'Cause I can say, well, I don't know if you've done enough.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.540]   Maybe you need to give more to the church.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.660]   Maybe you need to do a little bit more.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.340]   Maybe you need to be nicer to me.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.020]   And this is what happens within cults.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.460]   You see cult leaders do this
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.860]   and use this fear against people.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.740]   And so Christianity is the only religion,
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.360]   certainly the only world religion that I know of
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.860]   that offers assurance of salvation.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:35.380]   It says that you can know.
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.820]   It's in 1 John chapter five, 11 through 13.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.740]   It says, and this is God's testimony.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.020]   Okay, so this is the story of God.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.020]   He shares here in 1 John.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.220]   Here's the story of God.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.780]   God has given us eternal life.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.060]   Where, how, how do I get?
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.540]   And this life is in his son.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.400]   Whoever has the son has life.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.620]   Whoever does not have the son of God does not have life.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.180]   I write these things to you
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.180]   who believe in the name of the son of God
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.180]   so that you may know that you have eternal life.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.340]   So I want you to look at that word, K-N-O-W,
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.740]   that word know there,
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.400]   that you can know that you have eternal life,
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.900]   that you can be certain.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.400]   In Greek, this word translates
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.460]   to know as a fact as though to see it.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.900]   That you can be a 10,
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.820]   that you don't have to leave here
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.820]   a coin toss away from hell.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:37.220]   50% chance that I'm gonna go and burn in hell,
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.700]   suffer in hell forever.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.560]   A 20% chance, a 10% chance is no way to live
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.780]   that you can leave here and be certain
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.020]   that you're going to be with God forever and ever
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.280]   and ever and ever and ever in his presence,
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.460]   in his kingdom forever.
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.140]   And that is worth celebrating.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.100]   That brings joy to our hearts.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.380]   That gives us a reason to live, a purpose to move forward.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.740]   It allows us to see past our struggles.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.340]   It allows us to lean into him.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.300]   It allows us to seek him, right?
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.900]   It allows us to know him,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.020]   that we would move toward God and study his word.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.620]   It should bring a peace that transcends all understanding
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:17.820]   to guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.020]   And without it, we're left with an uncertainty.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.540]   I just don't know.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.500]   That's no way to live tomorrow.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.680]   I just don't know.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.620]   My kids, man, they're always asking for stuff.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.500]   Can we buy this?
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.340]   Can we go here?
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.180]   Can we do this?
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.540]   Can I get this?
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.620]   And I try to answer them straight all the time.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.500]   And they learned what a RV is, okay?
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.700]   Like we're driving down the street.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.620]   They're like, "Daddy, what's that?"
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.220]   I'm like, "Well, it's like a house on wheels."
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.740]   They're like, "Pfft, pfft, mind blown, you know?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.580]   "House on wheels?
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.740]   "Daddy, we got to get one of those."
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.040]   I'm like, "Yeah, pray."
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.620]   And so they're like, "Daddy, Daddy, can we?"
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.620]   They schemed on me.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.460]   That's what they do.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.300]   They get together, they talk, and they come
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.660]   in a unified force.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.700]   And it's hard to say no to these cute faces.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.000]   They're like, "Daddy, okay, here's what we did.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.500]   "We all picked a state, okay?
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.980]   "And we would like to drive there.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.620]   "We'd like to get an RV.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.400]   "So you buy an RV, Dad, that's your part.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.640]   "You're gonna buy the RV, and then we're gonna drive.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.900]   "We'll each go to our states,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.700]   "and that will be our vacation.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.820]   "Daddy, can we do it?"
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:21.820]   And I'm like, "I don't know, man.
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.940]   "I don't think so, probably not."
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.900]   And they're like, "So maybe?
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.940]   "You telling me there's a chance?"
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.180]   And they come at me every day.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.940]   They're like, "Daddy, so I'm gonna go to Alabama,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:31.980]   "and they're gonna go to Kentucky."
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.380]   And I'm like, "Why?
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.500]   "Why would you do that?"
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.020]   And so they're scheming on me, right?
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.820]   And they're just left all summer with this uncertainty.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.300]   They're excited about an idea,
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.400]   but they don't know if they can really celebrate.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.040]   Now, that's very different if I look at them,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.360]   and I say, "Hey, guys, listen.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:54.860]   "I got the RV.
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:58.020]   "It's in the driveway, and we're gonna go tomorrow.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.180]   "Like God willing, if he gives us tomorrow,
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.620]   "we're all jumping in that RV,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.220]   "and we are going to Alabama and Kentucky."
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.500]   You know? (audience laughing)
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.220]   It's gonna happen, right?
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.680]   And that's a different celebration when they know that.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.340]   It's a done deal.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.580]   This is what Christ said to you.
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.660]   He looks at you from the cross
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.860]   with his arms stretched wide,
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.920]   and he says, "Come.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.940]   "Come, I've prepared a place for you.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.540]   "Would you come?
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:38.060]   "I've suffered and died for you
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.180]   "so that you don't have to suffer.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.340]   "You can have eternal life.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.400]   "I've defeated the grave for you.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.260]   "Would you come?
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.020]   "It's as good as done, it is finished."
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.860]   Indeed.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.560]   So you say, "Well, can I lose my salvation?"
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.800]   I don't know, what'd you do to get your salvation?
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.960]   You can't lose something
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.760]   that you didn't do anything to earn.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.580]   If you didn't do anything to earn it,
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.040]   then how can it be taken away from you
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.620]   if it was given to you freely in spite of you,
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.840]   for it is by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.960]   and this is not of yourselves, it's a gift of God.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.640]   Gift of God, gift of God,
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.160]   not by works, not by works, not by works,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.900]   so that no one can boast, it's Ephesians 2, 8, 9.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.160]   If you did nothing for it,
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.000]   then how could you lose it?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.100]   What did you, what would you do to lose it?
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.920]   And so in summary, there is one way to heaven,
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.200]   and his name is Jesus.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.100]   Everyone is invited,
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.680]   and you can be sure.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   If you wanted to know how to get to London,
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:03.920]   you could ask me, I was just there.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.560]   The reason I know the way to London
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.040]   is because I was just there and I came back here.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.200]   If you want to know how to get to heaven,
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.900]   find someone who's been there and came here,
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:21.240]   and look carefully at what they've said, right?
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   If you trust me and you trust that I was there recently,
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.640]   and you trust my sanity,
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.400]   then you trust that I know how to get there.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.960]   You better believe the Queen of England
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.700]   knows how to get to London.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.900]   She lives there.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.560]   You better believe the King of Heaven
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.620]   knows how to get to heaven.
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:45.620]   He lives there, he reigns there, he's king there,
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.880]   and everything you see and everything you know, he created.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.440]   So if you're going to trust something,
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.840]   why not trust his word?
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.600]   There's some crazy language in this text.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.000]   Some really strange language.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.880]   I don't know if you've listened this whole way
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.480]   and you haven't questioned what it says.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.060]   It says some crazy things.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:12.400]   He says, "In my father's house, there are many rooms."
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.800]   Like if you're the disciples, you're listening to this,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.560]   you're like, "Dude, okay, your dad's rich, I get it, man.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.100]   "Why are we talking about your dad's crib right now?
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.200]   "Like what's going on?"
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.760]   He's like, "He's got a big house, lots of rooms."
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.520]   You're like, "I'm confused."
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.640]   He said, "I'm going there to prepare a room for you."
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.160]   I gotta show you something beautiful, okay?
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   Like this always stirs my heart.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:41.080]   Jesus here is using a really intimate language.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.520]   It's the Jewish wedding language.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.600]   You gotta hear me on this, okay?
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.440]   Stay with me.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.840]   We see it so clearly in this text.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.920]   What would happen is when a Hebrew boy,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.100]   a young Jewish boy was of age and ready to go get married,
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.020]   what he would do is he would leave his land
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.560]   and go to a foreign land in search of a bride.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.760]   He would leave his father's land
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.920]   and go to a foreign land in search of a bride,
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.080]   someone to take as his wife.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.860]   And when he would find her, are you ready?
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.180]   When he would find her,
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.280]   he would pay what was called a dowry.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.080]   He put down a down payment.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.840]   It was a heavy sum to show that,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.080]   "Hey, I mean business.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.760]   I'm coming back for you."
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.120]   Because he'd have to leave.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.040]   And the reason that he would leave,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.280]   so he would go to her father and he'd pay this dowry,
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.040]   saying, "Hey, I'm purchasing the right
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.120]   to take your daughter as mine forever."
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.140]   And then he would leave
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.840]   and he'd go back to the land that he came from.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   And he would begin to build a room on his father's house
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:51.880]   that they would live in,
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.000]   because his father's house
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.280]   was one day gonna be his house.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.000]   Inheritance was everything in this culture.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.800]   And so he would begin to build this room for him
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.200]   and his new bride to live in forever.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.680]   And at a time and an hour when no one knew,
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.400]   he would go back and he would return for her.
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.360]   People would run in front of him,
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.640]   his bridal party, if you would, his groomsmen,
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.280]   and they'd blast trumpets and they'd say, "He's coming."
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.320]   And the word would spread from town to town.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.900]   It would go in front of him until it reached her.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.560]   And she would hear, "Hey, your bride is coming,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.880]   your groom is coming, your groom is coming for you."
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.180]   And she would quickly scramble
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.880]   and get her wedding dress and her bridal party.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.560]   And he would come and he'd look at her and he'd say,
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.480]   "You are now mine forever.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.420]   Come, let's go back to my land,
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.240]   back to my home,
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.320]   and back to this room."
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.240]   And so what Jesus is saying to you,
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.480]   he's saying, "Hey, I've paid for you.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.340]   I've put down the dowry for you, my bride,
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.760]   so that I can take you home to be with me forever.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.760]   Now, I've purchased you with my own blood,
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.440]   poured out for you to cover your sins.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.200]   And now I'm going to go home to my father's house
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.680]   and prepare a place for you, for all of you,
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.320]   for anyone who would like to dwell there,
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.240]   for anyone who would like to accept the payment
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.140]   of the blood that he shed for your sins,
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.640]   that you can be with him forever and ever and ever
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.080]   and ever and ever and ever."
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.580]   (congregation applauding)
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.600]   I'm going to ask you to shut your eyes again, if you would.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.440]   Thank you.
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:41.100]   Hundreds and hundreds of you,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.840]   said, "I'm not sure.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.720]   I'm not a 10."
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.900]   And if you're at a place right now
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.260]   where you would like to be a 10,
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.340]   to move from a five to a 10, a nine to a 10,
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.140]   a seven to a 10, would you raise your hand?
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.980]   Would you put it up so that I can see it?
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.500]   Okay, I see it, that's amazing.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.800]   Praise God, praise God.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.140]   That's incredible, that's incredible.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.300]   Praise God for you.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.920]   Wow, that is overwhelming, that's overwhelming.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.420]   Okay, you guys can look at me.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:17.500]   I'm not trying to be manipulative.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.520]   I don't need anything from you,
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.880]   but we're going to sing a song.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.220]   And my prayer, and you don't have to,
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.640]   but my prayer is that if you just raised your hand,
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.400]   and so many of you just did,
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.960]   that you'd have the courage to come up here.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.520]   And I'd come back up after this song
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.200]   and I would pray over you.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.080]   And dear, in this song, you just come forward,
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.440]   just come to the altar,
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.320]   come up here and know that he's prepared a place for you.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.160]   Would you do that?
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.240]   Let me pray.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.280]   Father, thank you so much for those that just said,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.960]   "I want to be sure, I know, I know what Christ did for me.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.280]   "I know what he paid for me."
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   Lord, would you stir in them the courage to tell somebody
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.520]   about the power of your Holy Spirit?
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.000]   Would you work into their hearts,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.440]   surround them with men and women who love them and know you
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.040]   and who know them and love you?
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:29.200]   Father, thank you for the gift of salvation
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.600]   that comes to us by way of your Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.880]   and your Holy Spirit who seals us and preserves us
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:40.520]   and carries us home so that the enemy can't snatch us away.
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.560]   Father, we sing to you now, we worship you now.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.880]   In Jesus' name, amen.
