[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   >> That was amazing, amazing.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   That was excellent.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400]   I feel like we needed a wrecking ball swinging back and forth.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   What are you on it?
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.760]   >> I forgot my- >> Are you all not done?
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.500]   >> I'm not done.
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.360]   >> What'd you say?
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.400]   >> I said I forgot my outfit or- >> I don't think that outfit would be
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.080]   appropriate.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.400]   Are you all- >> I haven't even seen that video.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.160]   >> I don't wanna end it.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160]   I feel like we could all go for a little bit more.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.080]   What a perfect way to start.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   Tonight we are in a dating series.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   So we're discussing just topics as it relates to dating.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.440]   That song is a popular breakup song right now.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.400]   And aren't breakup songs like the worst?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.960]   Whether it's like Usher or Adele or Boyz II Men or
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.960]   everything Taylor Swift has ever written.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.720]   >> [LAUGH] >> They're just like,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.760]   especially if you're going through a breakup, they're just the worst.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.560]   So tonight, if you haven't guessed it, we are discussing this topic.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.720]   My first experience with love and relationships happened when I was in
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.160]   the second grade.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.520]   I was in Miss Ennihosa's class.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.440]   It was a little brunette girl that sat right in front of me.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.680]   And shortly after meeting this young lady,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.240]   she came up one day on the playground wearing umbro shorts.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.880]   And she asked, she told me, I think we should be boyfriend and girlfriend.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.840]   Which was a little like, whoa, girl, initiating.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.040]   But I was okay with it then, so I'm in.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.880]   And so shortly after that, Valentine's Day came.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   Never had a Valentine before.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.520]   And she gave me a beaded ring that she had made with her mom.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.080]   It was like, I was smitten.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   And I'm watching A Lot of Saved by the Bell at this point, for some reason.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.080]   So this is my Kelly Kapowski.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.280]   And shortly after that, all of my hopes and
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.080]   dreams for this relationship and blossoming one would be totally smashed to pieces.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.000]   Because a few weeks later, she showed up and said, I think we should break up.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.920]   Yeah, I know, and as a seven year old, you're like, I thought we were going to
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.960]   the altar, what?
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.600]   Don't tell me that ring didn't mean something to you, that was a symbol, what?
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.080]   And not only that, she asked for the ring back.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.800]   Yeah, like I pawned that thing.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.000]   I don't even have any, it's not worth anything to them or me, what?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.520]   But it was a first experience that I can remember just being, I don't even care.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.480]   And it was really the first of a long number,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.920]   a chain of just breakups that are painful.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.240]   Regardless of how often, how well you date,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.000]   they can still be hard to walk through.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.360]   And often it's like, yeah, we're just friends.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.880]   She hates me, but we're still just, we're like friends that hate each other, and
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.360]   they're just hard.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.200]   And so tonight, we're going to discuss the topic of breakups and how to break up,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.560]   when to break up, and when not to break up.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.680]   Because in the reality of life, in a dating world, which we live in,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.880]   breakups are a part of that and a necessary one as we explore and
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   search and find the right person.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.600]   So we're going to go through, really, a list of when to break up.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.640]   Because in this dating series, here's what we know.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.760]   Dating is meant to lead to marriage.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.000]   And so before you have a broken marriage,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.520]   it is better to have a broken relationship.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.680]   So we're going to cover some big ones.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.640]   We've covered some of them before, but these are just ones of when to break up.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.120]   Here's the first one.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.120]   When they are not a follower of Christ.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.760]   Not when they are not a Christian, or not when they say that they go to church.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.280]   When they are not following Christ with their life, when the active pursuit and
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.600]   the path and direction of their life is not towards following Jesus,
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.920]   it is worth breaking up now before the destruction that lays in front of you.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.960]   Here's what Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.680]   Do not be yoked or partnered together with unbelievers,
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.440]   for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.120]   Missionary dating, and this is so important, is a bad idea.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.960]   It's a terrible idea.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.040]   And here's why.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.480]   You need to know this.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.720]   Because you can fall in love with someone who does not believe the same things
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.000]   that you believe.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.960]   Do you know that?
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.120]   You can fall in love, you can give your heart to someone who is not a follower
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.920]   of Jesus, and it happens.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.240]   Maybe it's happened to some of you in this room.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.960]   And when a person, and the path of their life is not headed in the direction
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.400]   of Christ, it is going to be costly.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.960]   And so you need to hit the ejection seat now.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.320]   Because here's what dating is.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.800]   Dating is a path that leads to a promise, that's marriage,
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.080]   that leads to a lifelong pursuit.
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.440]   That's what dating is.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.000]   And so if you are dating or casually dating, and you're dating someone who's not
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.320]   of the same belief about Jesus is my Lord and Savior, and I'm committed
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   to following Him, not just, "Hey, I'm a Christian, but I'm a follower
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.320]   of Christ," you need to break up.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   Here's the second one.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.440]   When community around you has counseled towards this.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.080]   So I'm going to pause before we do this one.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.120]   This assumes that you're in community.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.000]   If you are not in community or you are dating someone and you or they are not
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.200]   in community, you are going to be in trouble.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.520]   You are missing out on God's provision for your life.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.400]   One of the chief ways that He says He speaks to us is through the counsel
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.120]   of His people around us.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.360]   And so if you are dating without community or the person you are dating does not
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.720]   have community, what's community?
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.920]   Community is a group of believers who gather with them regularly or with you
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.040]   regularly and speak into your life.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.520]   You are playing with fire, and it's going to end badly.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.800]   Okay, so back to community.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.880]   When community has counseled towards this, here's what I mean.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.760]   I got a call this past week, and it was from a friend of mine who said,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.720]   "Hey, look, I just have a question.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.560]   I think I'm going to break up with my girlfriend, and she is a woman
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.440]   of incredible character.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.080]   She is a godly woman, and she's wonderful.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.160]   But there's something just where I don't see us moving towards marriage.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.120]   Am I crazy to break up with her?
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.800]   I've spoken to my community, and they think the wise thing to do because I'm not
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.320]   moving towards marriage would be to break up.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.040]   Is this crazy?
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.600]   Am I wrong?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.680]   I hear the dating messages that you all do at the porch, and it just seems like I'm
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.120]   crazy for wanting to do this."
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.160]   And I told him, "No, not at all.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.720]   If you're in a relationship and you're not moving towards marriage,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:32.120]   then you're in a relationship that's pointless because dating is meant to lead
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.760]   to a promise that leads to a lifelong pursuit.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:42.280]   And so if that is not the path that you are on, then hit the ejection seat now."
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.760]   This kind of repeats the same idea.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:51.120]   When you are not moving towards marriage, here's a fourth one.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.080]   When you are not on the same page about sexual purity, if you are dating someone
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.160]   and they are pulling you or pressuring you towards having sex, you need to get
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.760]   out now because breaking up at a later time would statistically,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.920]   your chances increase dramatically.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.000]   But even if stats are on the side, it is going to be significantly more
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.280]   painful if that day comes, if you are having sex with that person.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.320]   And part of Paul's instructions to young men and women was, "Hey,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.120]   flee sexual immorality."
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.080]   And so what you and I do in relationships where we're being pulled in that direction
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.840]   or pressured in that direction, that's one way we flee, is we break up.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:36.360]   Here's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6, 18, "Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.800]   All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually,
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.240]   sins against their own body.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.600]   Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.960]   whom you have received from God?
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.240]   You are not your own."
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.800]   Think about that.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.560]   Paul says, "Look, hey, flee sexual immorality."
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.880]   And here's what you need to remember.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.600]   And as you're doing that, you're not your own.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.160]   Your body right now is on loan from God who loves you and wants you to use that
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.240]   body in a way that's not going to lead to pain.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.560]   And he says, "You were bought with a price."
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.880]   And so flee sexual immorality and break up.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.000]   And as hard as it's going to be, and it's going to be hard,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.920]   so I'll just take a tangent.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.840]   Breakups are just, they're hard.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.200]   They really are.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.520]   Even when you do it really, really well, they're still, we're emotional beings,
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.360]   so it just can be really painful or painful.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:42.600]   So some of these things will really guard you against the catastrophic outcome that
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.280]   could be there and will be there if you do not do them, but they're just hard.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.720]   That's why guarding your heart and taking things slow is so important.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.080]   And seeing your dating as an opportunity where you will either honor or dishonor
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.400]   your heavenly father.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.280]   My first conversation with our senior pastor, whose name is Todd,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.960]   he was here a few weeks ago, was about this topic of dating where I literally
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.840]   had just met him.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.680]   I sat down with him and he said, "Are you dating someone?"
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   And this was like five years ago, I wasn't.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.800]   And I said, "No."
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.320]   He said, "Why not?"
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.840]   Which is always like a funny question.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.960]   I feel like, "You're not dating."
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.480]   "I don't know.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.760]   I have lip fungus or something.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   I'm just not."
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.760]   And he said, "Okay, that's great.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.840]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.000]   There's a lot of young ladies on our staff.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.520]   You get one shot.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.960]   If you break her heart, if you don't lead her well, if you do anything that causes
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:47.000]   her at the end of that relationship to say, 'I'm totally great with him dating any
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.240]   other girl on our staff,' then you don't ever date anyone on our staff again."
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.560]   And that's why I didn't date anyone on our staff again.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.320]   But his point was, "Look, if you do not leave her better than you found her,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.960]   which is your responsibility as a Christian man, then you won't date again,
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:12.440]   and you will dishonor God, and there will be other consequences to go along with that."
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.760]   And so this is just the last thing about breaking up.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.600]   I think, believers, as you break up and walk through this, that we are called to do
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.640]   this gently and honorably to the other person.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.000]   As much pain is involved or as low as you think that that other person is or doesn't
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.440]   really matter and this is how I feel, here's what we do know, that whoever he or
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.120]   she is, if you're breaking up, this is really important.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.040]   It's really important to Jesus.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:47.680]   They are someone that Jesus died on the cross for and says, "He's mine."
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.920]   And so as you walk through that, and it's going to happen, it may need to happen
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:59.320]   after tonight, do it gently, speaking honestly, not blaming it on God,
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.880]   but speaking honestly.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.600]   And here's the last one.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.920]   Here's when to break up, before we get married, which I wish went without saying,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   but it clearly hasn't in our country.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:21.920]   And so we're going to discuss when not to in marriage and that when to not break up,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.000]   i.e., marriage, and really Jesus' words on marriage and on divorce.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.640]   But here's what we know about divorce.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.680]   This is what Time Magazine said a couple of years ago.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.840]   "There is no single force causing as much measurable hardship and human misery in
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.320]   this country as the collapse of marriage."
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.000]   Five out of 10, between four and five out of 10 people are having divorces.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.480]   The amount of pain and misery in our land is almost incalculable.
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.080]   Psychology and sociology has done studies and they've discovered that when a person
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.320]   walks through a divorce, I promise this is going somewhere.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.680]   If you're going, "Why are we talking about this?
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.760]   I'm not married.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.320]   I'm not even dating right now."
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.280]   I promise it's going somewhere because remember, dating is a path and most
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.000]   likely you will get married.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.560]   In fact, 80% of you will get married before you leave the decade you're in.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:23.200]   And dating is a path that leads to a promise, that leads to a lifelong pursuit.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.720]   And there is nothing destroying our nation like the collapse of marriage.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.080]   And the war against marriage is not coming from the homosexual agenda,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:38.520]   it's coming from within the church and the collapse of the sanctity of marriage
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.800]   between man and woman, divorce.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:48.960]   And this message is so important for you and for me and for our nation to hear
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.040]   because we live in a culture that says nothing close to what God's standard
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.680]   of marriage and divorce is.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.200]   Kanye West in the club going, "We want prenup, we want prenup."
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.720]   It comes not close in any way.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.320]   That's right.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:13.360]   And any time, as we said last week, a nation or a people devalues something,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.440]   as we're going to see tonight with marriage, God says is of incredible value,
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.800]   the result is catastrophic.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.480]   And so we're just going to explore what Jesus says about this because there is a
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:32.720]   tidal wave of destruction pouring through our land.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.480]   Some of it's been poured into this room, it's been poured into my life.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.120]   Divorce in every way that I look, is there my grandparents, my parents,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.720]   sibling, my wife's parents.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.480]   And Jesus has something to say about it.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.680]   And I promise you this, you're probably going to learn something
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.880]   about what his view on marriage, which is very distinct from the culture
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.720]   around us, but his words in the midst of a culture that so devalues marriage
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.480]   are breathtaking.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.120]   And we're going to see it.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.360]   We're going to be in Matthew 19 as we explore what Jesus has to say about this
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.680]   topic about when to not divorce and why this is so important because all of you
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.200]   are heading towards that direction.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.320]   And maybe the generation before us, nobody told them.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.960]   And oftentimes, the problem is people like this that do what I do or do what JP
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.920]   does, they stand up here and they do not teach what Jesus said because it's just
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.000]   not practical as it relates to marriage and divorce.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.400]   And so we're going to discover what he says.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.600]   And I'll say this, I don't like what Jesus says or I'm not comfortable with it.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.640]   It makes me uncomfortable.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.480]   And I know that the people who heard what Jesus had to say about marriage felt the
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.200]   same way.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   In fact, this is the response that they had.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.440]   The disciples who said to him, this is Matthew 19, verse 10, "If this is the
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.440]   situation," as Jesus discusses marriage, "between a husband and a wife, it's better
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.240]   to not marry."
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.640]   And you would expect Jesus, if we're going to see what he says, you'd expect him to go,
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.360]   "Oh, no, no, no, marriage is awesome.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.160]   You got to do it.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:06.840]   It's great."
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.240]   He goes, "Yeah, some people can handle it, some people can't."
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.520]   And he walks off.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.120]   And so if that's not the response or if that is the response you feel as we leave
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.720]   tonight, I feel it with you and we probably understand it appropriately.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.400]   But here's what he says.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.600]   So Matthew 19, verse 3, we're going to pick it up right there.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   "Some Pharisees came to test him."
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.040]   Pharisees were these legal experts or experts in the Old Testament and they were
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.880]   always trying to test Jesus because Jesus was really popular with the people and they
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.840]   didn't like that.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.000]   So they come up and they're going to test him about this subject.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.120]   And they asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.720]   So here's what they're asking.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.520]   What are the circumstances under which it's possible to get a divorce?
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.320]   When would it be possible for a husband and wife to split up?
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.120]   And in Jesus's day, there were two schools of thought.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.560]   There was one school that said you can get a divorce anytime you want.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.440]   If you find someone who's prettier, if you find...if she burns the toast,
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.960]   that's literally written in the literature from the first century.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.520]   You can walk away, talk about security there.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.680]   If you find anything wrong with her, you can marry someone else.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.560]   And then there was another school of thought that said only if there's been
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.920]   sexual immorality or adultery can you divorce your wife.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   And so they asked Jesus, "Hey, we want to know where you stand.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.320]   What are the circumstances under which a man can divorce his wife?"
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.840]   And here's what he says.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.640]   "Haven't you read," he replied, "that in the beginning, the Creator made them male
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.720]   and female?"
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.560]   And the Pharisees are going, "Okay, Jesus.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.240]   Okay, that's great.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.160]   That's fascinating.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.520]   Male and female in the beginning.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.160]   What are the circumstances under which a man can get a divorce?"
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.960]   Don't go off topic or give me a parable.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:06.480]   What are the circumstances under which...and here's what he says.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:12.320]   And said, "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united."
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.800]   That's the word "glued."
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   It's the same word that appears at this time in other literature for glue.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.080]   If you glued something together.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.560]   "A man will leave his father and mother and he will be united or glued to his wife
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.080]   and the two will become one flesh."
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:32.040]   Jesus says, maybe you didn't realize this, but when marriage takes place,
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.960]   when a man and a woman come together, it's not just a ceremony and a honeymoon.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.240]   It's not just a certificate and then there's some exciting stuff afterwards.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.240]   He says, "No, no, no, no.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.560]   There's something so much bigger and there's another party involved."
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.600]   And he's going to tell us who it is.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:54.200]   "So the two are no longer...so they are no longer two," verse 6, "but one flesh.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.040]   Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   That Jesus says, when a person, a man and a woman get married, that they no longer are
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:13.920]   just Jack and Jill, but the two have been two entities who have now become one.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.480]   And they cannot be separated.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.000]   That they're no longer these two different things.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.160]   He says, "Look, when the two came together, you didn't realize it.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.600]   You may not have thought it, but when you marry that person or when a person marries
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:35.040]   a spouse, they become united in a way that they cannot be separated," is what he says.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.080]   He essentially says this, "The goal of marriage is not oneness.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.720]   The result of marriage is oneness.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.840]   And you may not have realized it."
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:55.640]   But this is Jesus who's saying, "When that took place, they are no longer two, they are
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.280]   one person.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.520]   And you cannot separate a person.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.320]   They may not feel like it and may not look like it, but," he says, "God has done something
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:13.040]   and He is the active agent in every wedding and in every marriage.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:18.880]   And He is uniting and has united someone in a way that it cannot be separated."
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.640]   You can't now try to take some of the water and you pour some in here and you pour some
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.480]   in there and it's not the same.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.960]   And he says, "What God has joined together, man cannot separate."
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.780]   In effect, they're saying, "Hey, when is it permissible?"
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.520]   And he says, "It's not even possible.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.300]   You're asking the wrong question."
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.640]   And that right there is where Jesus stops his answer.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.680]   And in fact, he just says, "Don't do it.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.280]   You can't."
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.960]   And we want to run to circumstances.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.160]   My mind, my heart runs, "Wait a second.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.640]   What about she walked out and he did this and there was abuse and what about..."
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:04.920]   And Jesus just says, "It's not possible that there was something deeper going on and maybe
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:10.600]   no one even told you or your parents.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.280]   But God has joined them together and you can't separate them."
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.120]   And at this point, Pharisees are going high-fiving each other because they're going, "Wait a
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.120]   second.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   He contradicted Moses.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.120]   Moses wrote about divorce.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   Okay, now we got him.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   Okay.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   Okay.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   So Jesus, verse seven.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:32.560]   "Why then," they asked, "did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.880]   divorce and send her away?"
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   Jesus replies.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.800]   So they're referring to Moses in the Old Testament wrote a law where, "Hey, if a husband divorces
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.200]   his wife, he has to give her a certificate."
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.560]   Here's what Jesus says.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:54.440]   "I tell you," whoops, "Moses," verse eight, "Moses permitted," whoops, that was powerful,
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.360]   "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   Moses didn't command you.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.840]   Moses permitted you because your hearts were hard."
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.320]   Here's what he says.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.680]   "You know the history of your nation.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.120]   You know what was taking place.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.680]   In Moses' day, women could not divorce their husband.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.920]   In Jesus' day, it was the same way.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.080]   Moses instituted divorce because the husbands were hard-hearted," he says.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.520]   "They were kicking their wives out saying, 'I'm going to do what I want to do.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.840]   I'm not going to care for you anymore, so good luck out there.'"
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:39.000]   And because they would not yield, their hearts were hard, Moses said, "I'm going to have
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.120]   every husband who does that write a certificate of divorce."
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.040]   So they have to sign their name so that when the wife is kicked out, she's not just going,
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.920]   "I'm just sleeping around," and she can say, "No, he divorced me.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.400]   I've got no place to go.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.920]   Can I sleep here tonight or go back to her family with proof that I'm not just running
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   away?
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   I have been divorced."
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:06.200]   And Jesus says, "You know why, because of sin, because to protect the women, in order
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.920]   to protect women."
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:16.960]   But he says this, "But it was not so from the beginning."
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.520]   Because here's what we know about marriage.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:30.240]   We can add rules, we can change rules, but in the beginning, God created it, and marriage
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.120]   belongs to him.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:39.880]   And he says, "Divorce belongs to man, but in the beginning, it was not so."
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:46.020]   This next sentence is the most debated sentence as it relates to this topic that there really
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.840]   is in this passage and maybe in the New Testament.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.280]   So buckle up.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.680]   "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality," we're going
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.000]   to come back to that phrase, "and marries another," I tell you that anyone who divorces
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.720]   his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   Jesus says, "If you think because a court gave you a certificate that you are no longer
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.560]   one, but now you're two, you've been divorced," he said, "you may have recognized that.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.480]   Your mom may have recognized it, your grandma, the court may have, but in God's eyes, he
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   hasn't, that you cannot separate what God has made one."
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.800]   And they're thinking, "Wait, Jesus, I'm not sure you understand.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:36.140]   When a person who's divorced marries another person, that's not adultery, that's a divorced
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.140]   person getting married.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.560]   I mean, you're not understanding the terms.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.840]   A divorced person cannot commit adultery against this person.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.560]   They're divorced, they're not married anymore."
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:53.200]   And Jesus says, "No, you cannot separate it."
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.760]   The phrase, "except for sexual immorality."
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.640]   There's two ways, really, that we understand this verse to work.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   The first just says, "Hey, that is the exception clause that Jesus gives, that, hey, you can't
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.160]   get a divorce except for if there's been sexual immorality in a relationship."
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.240]   It's a general word, not meaning adultery, it just means sexual immorality.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:16.920]   I mean, of course, lust, anything.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   That's the only case.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.680]   So that's one way that people understand it.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.520]   The second is that this is not a reference to adultery, because it's just the word "porneia."
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.920]   So if it was just porneia, it means just lust of any kind.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.560]   The second is that, hey, this is not for the case of adultery.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.800]   In other words, Jesus isn't saying, "Hey, when you get, if someone commits adultery,
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.080]   you have an out."
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.440]   And that argument is based on a few things.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.840]   Here, I'm just gonna give you kind of the reasons why that camp believes what it does,
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.960]   and you can decide for yourself.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.600]   Because this phrase, the exception clause, does not appear in the other places where
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   this is taught, in Mark and in Luke.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.640]   That "except for sexual immorality," it just says, "I tell you, anyone who divorces his
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.680]   wife and marries another commits adultery."
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.040]   That's all it says.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.800]   That's Mark 10 and Luke 16.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.220]   You can go read it later.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.860]   And so that's one reason, and the reason they think it's in Matthew is because Matthew was
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.120]   written to a Jewish audience.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.040]   The other ones are written to Greeks and to Romans.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:20.640]   And so to the Jews, this word, "porneia," represented something that happened in Jewish
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   culture.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.640]   Here's what happened.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:29.080]   In the betrothal period, which is like engagement, when a person, when there was sexual immorality
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.560]   during the betrothal or the engagement, you had to have a divorce.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.080]   Some of you guys may have a broken engagement.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.200]   You couldn't just break an engagement in this culture.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.720]   You had to legally get a divorce.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:46.160]   And the grounds for which it was okay to divorce were sexual immorality, porneia.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.520]   And so when Jesus says this, they think that he's referencing during the betrothal period,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.280]   which is very confusing.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:27:00.800]   But this is why Joseph had to divorce Mary quietly once he found out she was pregnant.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   Ever wonder that?
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.960]   Why does he have to divorce her?
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.060]   The betrothed.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:09.360]   Because in this culture, which is also in Matthew 1, 18, betrothal had to be divorced.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.200]   And so that's the camp of how this is not, this is referring to that.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:19.080]   The second reason is because the church fathers did not see remarriage as even possible for
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.020]   the first 500 years.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.200]   That they thought, okay, they can get a divorce in man's eyes, but not in God's eyes.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.600]   And so they can't marry again.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:35.080]   So anyone who divorced in the first 500 years of the church, they could not ever marry again.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.680]   Because their one flesh they were no longer with, or their one flesh was still alive and
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.160]   still around.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.920]   The second reason would be just the porneia.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.960]   This is again why people think that this does not allow, Jesus is not giving an out for
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   marriage.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.500]   It is permanent.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.960]   Even if you don't recognize it as such.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.500]   The next reason is just the word porneia.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.960]   Jesus would not be making it a smaller scope that you can get a divorce.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   He'd be widening it.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:11.080]   He'd say, look, any husband who's ever looked at a woman lustfully, women you can divorce
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.360]   your husband.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.720]   Which would include every husband that's out there at the part of his body.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.240]   And so clearly that's not what Jesus is saying.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:28.680]   And I think one of the stronger reasons for this case against the permanence of marriage
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.520]   is the picture that marriage presents us.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.560]   Ephesians 5 says this, that it is a portrait of God's love for the church.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.560]   That's what marriage is.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.520]   It's so much bigger than a honeymoon and flowers.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.080]   That it is a picture of God's unending love.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.520]   Here's what Paul says in Ephesians 5.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.520]   Look at this.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.560]   This is like crazy.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.320]   For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.320]   We just saw that.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   And the two will become one flesh.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.320]   Oh, that's great, Paul.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.780]   You're talking about marriage.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.660]   This is a profound mystery.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:06.360]   But I am talking about Christ and the church.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   Wait a second, Paul.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   No, no, no, no.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.360]   You're talking about marriage.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.360]   You said a man and a woman come together.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.680]   And he says, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:19.880]   Marriage is a picture of God's unending love for the church and his pursuit of you and
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.320]   me even when we commit adultery with the idols in our life.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.880]   And it's so much bigger.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.800]   And I think the last reason for why this permanence or the strongest argument for this permanence
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.940]   is the disciples' response.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.940]   Verse 10 again.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:46.160]   "The disciples said to him, 'If this is the situation between a husband and a wife, it's
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.360]   better to not get married.'
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:55.480]   To which Jesus responds, 'Jesus replied, 'Not everyone can accept this word, but only those
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.520]   to whom it has been given.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.760]   For there are those who are eunuchs.'"
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.120]   Which is not really a term that we use today.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.360]   But a eunuch, we don't really do this surgery anymore.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   We do it to our dogs.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.080]   But in these days, eunuchs were just a person who had that sexual anatomy removed.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.720]   He said, "Some people have been eunuchs."
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   They were born that way.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.120]   Others have been made eunuchs when they would serve in a place where the king didn't want
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.120]   them.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.120]   We'll just keep going.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.840]   "And there are others who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.080]   There are some people who have been born that way, and there are some who choose to stay
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.080]   single."
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.560]   He's talking about singleness for their life.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.280]   "And whoever can accept this should."
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   Wait a second.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   Jesus, you didn't even respond.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.720]   You just said, "If this is the case, it's better to not marry."
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.760]   And he goes, "If that's what you think, then don't get married.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.280]   Stay single for the kingdom."
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:55.360]   But there is something deeper, and God is the one and the active agent at work.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:03.320]   And what he has joined together, you cannot separate.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.960]   So here's the application of why I think this is so important.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.800]   We were gonna talk about sex tonight.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.680]   I feel like that would have been so much more exciting of a talk.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.280]   This is so depressing.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.480]   And you guys look depressed.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.600]   So here's the application.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.160]   You would know what you're walking into.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.720]   If you are dating someone, this is what you're heading towards.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:32.840]   And our culture doesn't come close to what God says about marriage.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:38.280]   And it is an abomination to him.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:45.640]   And as you date, you are stepping on a path that leads to a promise, that leads to a lifelong
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:54.960]   pursuit that is a reflection of God's lifelong, unending pursuit of his bride, the church.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:02.600]   And so now, you need to choose and date wisely.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:09.080]   As to choosing who will be your master, choosing who will be your mate is the most important
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.480]   important decision that you'll make.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   And so choose wisely.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.120]   Marriage is a wonderful thing.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:26.520]   But according to Jesus, it's something that is far more significant than often we understand
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.080]   or realize.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.360]   God holds an incredibly high value.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:43.000]   That either it's not possible, or it would be like amputation with one flash.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.120]   What if I had been divorced?
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.920]   If this is a part of your story, you need to go to divorce care.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.160]   Divorce care meets on Tuesday nights.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:56.280]   It's an amazing ministry where they will help lead and walk through all the pain that's
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.120]   involved with walking through something like that.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:07.400]   And I think you need to pursue reconciliation with your spouse.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.120]   What if they're not a believer?
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.760]   It doesn't say it matters.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:20.920]   First Corinthians 7, it says if they abandon, then just let them go, but not to remarry.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.560]   But God's heart is always for reconciliation.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.000]   And we as ministers of reconciliation, which is what Paul says we are in 2 Corinthians
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   5, are called to be reconcilers of the world around us, including the marriage.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.560]   And so if that's a part of your story, and I think at the least you've got to wrestle
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.000]   with this stuff.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.160]   You've got to wrestle with it.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.200]   Because here's a question.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.840]   Let's say it doesn't matter if you pursue reconciliation.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   Divorce is great.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.960]   The world around us, knock on most church doors and they'll say, "That's totally great."
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.160]   The world around us won't give you that.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:02.880]   But let's say, let's say for a second that it's actually true.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   That Jesus, if we're understanding it right, he says don't separate what he has made one.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.560]   If it's true, I just want to ask, would you be willing to stay single for the rest of
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   your life?
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.080]   Not, hey, do it.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.860]   I'm just saying, hey, if it was true.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:33.000]   If you were 100% certain, would you be willing to stay single?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.540]   Or if it was 100% certain that God's will for you was to pursue reconciliation, regardless
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:45.200]   of what they did or how many times they left, whatever the circumstances was, would you
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   be willing?
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   Just would you be willing?
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.780]   If it's 100% true, would you be willing then to pursue reconciliation?
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.820]   I'm not even saying it is.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:35:01.380]   I'm just saying if we were able to drop our emotions, would you then?
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:07.100]   And this is so huge because the generations that have gone before us have done such a
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.860]   poor job about modeling this.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.300]   And here's what we know.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:16.860]   There's a lot of debate, but it is a big deal to God because he says it is a picture of
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.040]   my unending love for the church.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:26.220]   And so if I ever abandon my church, then you can abandon your wife.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.220]   But I never will.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.220]   And I'll never give up on her.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:36.900]   And he won't ever give up on you if you're a part of that.
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.100]   And so that is to be displayed in the marriages.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:46.100]   And God says it is a big, big deal to him.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:52.060]   I feel like this message, I read it, and it just like raises more questions for me than
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   answers.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.700]   I'm like, Jesus, what about, let's say Bob and Mary, and I feel like it just feels so
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.700]   condemning.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.260]   It's like, wait, Jesus, picking on divorced people.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.820]   And here's what I would say.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:09.260]   If that is, or if that's been a part of your parents' story, whatever story, when you read
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:14.340]   the gospels, it may seem like that here, but that's not the Jesus you interact with.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.780]   Like he didn't just go around condemning people like, oh, you got divorced and you slept with
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.600]   her and you're just a liar.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.860]   And going around telling people all the things they did bad.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:25.920]   He walks up to a woman, we said this last week, who just committed adultery.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.220]   And here's what he says, I don't condemn you.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.100]   And if that's a part of your story, any shame that you're feeling, I don't think if Jesus
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:41.360]   was here, you would have felt.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:50.780]   But this is the incredible truth about what marriage is and the high standard it has.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:56.840]   And regardless of where you are in the room on that scale, there's an incredible grace
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.340]   that's coupled with that every time we encounter Jesus.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:07.940]   And he offers it to us tonight.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.520]   But what is clear is it is a very big deal to God.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.420]   And so you need to wrestle with it, because if you're not walking through it or haven't
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.400]   ever walked through it or won't ever walk through it, the person sitting next to you
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.100]   will, statistically.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.520]   And so you need to figure out where that is before you get there.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.100]   That we're gonna fight.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.420]   There's pictures of this idea of what marriage is.
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.520]   Marriage is not just a man and a woman, that it is God's picture of how he loves us and
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.500]   how he loves his people all throughout the Bible.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.940]   One of the clearest ones of them is a book called Hosea, where an entire book of the
[00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.860]   Bible is devoted to this.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.020]   And here's what happens.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.020]   This is like such a crazy story.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.800]   Hosea was a prophet who lived 700 years before Christ.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.540]   And he was a prophet to the people of Israel.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.220]   So God would show up and he'd say, I'm gonna have a prophet who's gonna speak to the people
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.880]   on my behalf.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.220]   And he showed up to Hosea and said, you're gonna speak to the people on my behalf, but
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.540]   I want you to do something.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.020]   So God shows up and he tells him this, this is the second verse in the chapter.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.180]   I want you to go and marry a prostitute.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.900]   And I want you to have children of prostitution.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:24.100]   It's so shocking, because if you're Hosea, you're like, am I sure this is God right now?
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.260]   I feel like that sounds more like the devil or something.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.380]   And her name was Gomer.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.020]   It's like, she didn't have a cool prostitute name, Gomer.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:37.380]   So he says, I want you to go marry this prostitute.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.500]   And in the same sentence, he says, and you're gonna have children of prostitution that you're
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:48.700]   gonna raise, that she's going to have sex with other men and you will raise her children.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:55.980]   And it will be a picture of how my people have committed and forsaken adultery, committed
[00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:58.300]   adultery and forsaken me.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.300]   And you are going to love her.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:06.380]   It says God put in Hosea's heart that he would love her over and over and over again in the
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:09.860]   face of terrible, gut-wrenching circumstances.
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:14.660]   There's one point where she, after they had just had their kid, they just had a baby,
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.440]   she goes out and she begins sleeping with other men around the town.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.420]   And she eventually gets sold by one of these lovers into slavery.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:28.620]   And Hosea brings her food and he brings her water and he cares for her even when she refuses
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.620]   to come back home.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:34.220]   And he goes and he sells some of his property and he raises up enough money and he buys
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.460]   her back and he brings her home.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.060]   And then she does it again.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:46.540]   And God says, you love her like I have loved you.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.540]   And I'll never stop and I'll never give up.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.980]   And that we, when we are unfaithful, he is faithful.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.420]   And that is what marriage is a picture of.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.220]   I think we know this at some level.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.780]   That's not supposed to end in divorce.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.660]   I mean, even the vows that we take.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:10.060]   When I got married to my wife, we took these vows and we stood before this pastor and we
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.300]   said these vows.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   And here's what they were.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:18.740]   They were just that I promise I take you to be my wife, she said husband, to have and
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.980]   hold from this day forward for better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:31.140]   health, to love and to cherish from this day forward until death do we part.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.820]   And most of us don't, we don't think like that.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:38.740]   We would say really the vow should be until you sleep with my sister or until you run
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.660]   out and get a lot of credit card debt or until you get ugly.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:45.260]   And then I think I'm out of here.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.260]   It's true.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:54.300]   In fact, I only know one pastor, it's actually Todd, who in the wedding says, he includes,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.700]   including addiction, including adultery, you are not leaving.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.980]   There's nothing that can separate you.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.900]   And that's what it is for me and Callie.
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:11.820]   That not only if she gets in a car wreck and is paralyzed, but if she sleeps with my best
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.260]   friend and oh my gosh, how much pain would that be?
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:24.620]   But I'm called to pursue and to love because it is a portrait and a picture of what God
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.460]   has done for you and God has done for me.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:33.540]   And it's so much bigger than I think most of us realize or maybe we even can because
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:39.020]   two have become one and what God has united, let no man separate.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.020]   And that's what you're headed towards.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.020]   I'm going to pray.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:49.020]   Father, I just, man, this is such a hard, hard topic.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:42:00.420]   And I have so many questions about what you do in all these different circumstances.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:06.900]   I know in the room, there's a hundred of us who have experienced and walk through something
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:07.940]   like this.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.500]   And maybe, maybe it was right.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.500]   Maybe it's what you wanted.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.980]   Maybe it wasn't.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:20.060]   And we have experienced pain and hurt and someone who didn't love us.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:27.140]   Like you tell us you love us and you tell us a husband and wife are to love each other.
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.140]   So will you help us tonight?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.780]   Will you heal our wounds?
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:36.180]   You are the God who heals and will you help us to pursue your design and your goal and
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.820]   the beauty that is marriage?
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.700]   Beautiful because it reflects how you never give up on us and you're faithful even when
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.700]   we are not.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:45.700]   Amen.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.220]   Amen.
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.220]   Amen.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:48.220]   Amen.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:48.720]   Amen.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   Amen.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
