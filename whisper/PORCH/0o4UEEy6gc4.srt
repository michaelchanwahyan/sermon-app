1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:21,340
 - Man, that is intense, and I'm not sleeping tonight.

3
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,540
 - Hey, welcome, we are kicking off a brand new series

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,920
 tonight called The Unseen, where we will cover

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,440
 spiritual war, worlds, and wonders over the next few weeks.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,520
 And so if it is your first time joining with us,

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,960
 we are so glad that you are here,

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,160
 whether that is in Dallas or downtown,

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,680
 at Gillies or in Fort Worth, or Houston,

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,720
 or wherever you are tuning in.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,720
 Anyone a germaphobe in this room?

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,880
 Or let me say it another way,

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,420
 anyone normal and sane in this room?

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,160
 Like myself?

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,120
 My team likes to say that I am a hypochondriac,

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
 and they may be right,

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,240
 but the reason why they say that,

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
 or the reason why that is,

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,440
 is because, I don't know if you're like me,

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
 but hand sanitizer is one of my best friends in the world.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,680
 I keep some in my bag, I keep some in my car,

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,520
 two at home, one at my desk, it's everywhere,

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
 because I hate getting sick.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,280
 Can anyone relate to this?

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
 Anyone like, hey, I'm anti-germ?

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,040
 What is wrong with the rest of you?

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,320
 Wash your stinking hands, you people!

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,400
 I mean, when I go to eat with somebody,

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,180
 like if we were to go out to a meal,

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,280
 it happens every single time,

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,760
 and I always feel like I'm weird for doing this,

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,280
 and I'm always like, what is wrong with you?

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,400
 We'll sit down at the table, go into the restaurant,

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,040
 get there, begin to sit down, awesome.

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
 Hey, I'm gonna go to the restroom,

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
 gotta wash my hands, and I'll go to it,

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,120
 and I'll leave the person at the table,

38
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,040
 go wash my hands, and they'll just continue eating

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
 right away, like so much so that like,

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,080
 I don't wanna shake somebody's hand.

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,640
 If we're starting to eat at the meal,

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,960
 I'm like, I'll do the fist bump,

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
 and I feel like it's rude of you

44
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,760
 to expect me to shake your hand right now.

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,960
 I'm not taking whatever disease you wanna pass on.

46
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,500
 And if you're like that, maybe you can relate,

47
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,320
 where you're like, man, I just, I don't love getting sick

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,160
 or getting germs.

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,240
 Here's what's interesting about that.

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
 It is like 200 years ago, less than that, actually,

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,680
 like even the idea of being a germophobe,

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,400
 that term did not exist, the idea of like,

53
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,360
 hey, germs and shaking hands and getting them that way

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,360
 or bacteria did not exist for the longest time

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,200
 inside of really our world.

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,240
 There was no belief or people were not aware

57
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,200
 that there was such thing as germs or bacteria,

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
 and they just thought that disease

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
 and the way that it spread,

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,540
 there really wasn't a clear explanation

61
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,560
 for kind of how it spread.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
 I mean, this is like the 1800s we're talking,

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,680
 even in the later part of the 1800s,

64
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,040
 where people just thought there was something called

65
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,080
 spontaneous generation, which may take you back

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,760
 to like biology class in eighth grade,

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,640
 where you study this one time and then forgot it,

68
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,800
 but where the belief was, hey, disease,

69
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,680
 the way it was explained was spontaneous generation.

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,160
 Sometimes it would just pop up spontaneously,

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,900
 it would generate, and so there wasn't always

72
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,720
 a clear rhyme or reason and people would get sick

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
 and they'd be around other people,

74
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,240
 and those people wouldn't get sick,

75
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,200
 but someone else close to them would,

76
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,980
 and it just didn't always make sense,

77
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,480
 and people didn't know, and they just thought

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,680
 it's spontaneous generation, just spontaneously

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,220
 will generate and disease will pop up,

80
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,140
 until this guy came along, and yes,

81
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,520
 Colonel Sanders, and no, this is Luis Pasteur,

82
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,720
 and Luis Pasteur, if you remember him in that class

83
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
 that you were probably sleeping in,

84
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,400
 they talked about how pasteurization,

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,760
 and he came along and he proposed that no,

86
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,720
 hey, spontaneous generation with disease,

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,960
 that is not how this thing works.

88
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,360
 I mean, tragically, what drove him to really get into this

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,240
 and begin to devote his life to medical and disease

90
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,460
 and studying it was that he had five kids,

91
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,720
 and three of them died from typhoid fever,

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,000
 and so he said, man, if there's a way to prevent disease,

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,880
 I'm gonna spend the rest of my life studying it

94
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,960
 to understand it and know how we could either prevent it

95
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,640
 or treat it, so he begins to study,

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
 and here's what he begins to discover

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,960
 through all these different tests,

98
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,840
 he says, it's not spontaneous generation.

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,260
 There's these things called germs.

100
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,760
 There's these things called bacteria,

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,240
 and you can't see 'em, it's like these invisible things,

102
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,220
 and they're everywhere, like they're on the door handles

103
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,040
 you touch, they're on the money in your pockets,

104
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,480
 they're on the clothes that you're wearing.

105
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,900
 When you shake hands with people,

106
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,440
 they're passing all these different germs,

107
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,800
 and that is the reason why people are getting sick.

108
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,500
 Whenever you're using that utensil, I mean,

109
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,760
 think about it, to us, we're like, really, that's crazy,

110
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,660
 they didn't know this.

111
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,680
 The world in which he began to really push

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,880
 this idea forward, many people thought you're crazy.

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,360
 Like this knife that I just used in surgery,

114
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,180
 like it has these germs on it, I ran it underwater,

115
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,240
 I think it would be fine, and he's going,

116
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,360
 no, there's still bacteria on it, there's germs,

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,560
 there's this invisible world,

118
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,240
 and it is impacting the world around us,

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,960
 and if you're not careful, it's gonna lead,

120
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,160
 not just to you getting sick,

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,640
 people could possibly even die,

122
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,480
 there's this invisible world, and people are going,

123
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,160
 there's, Luis, really, there's an invisible world

124
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,260
 out there that's impacting the visible world

125
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,740
 that I live in, and he would say, yes, all around you.

126
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,800
 The things that you cannot see are being impacted

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,820
 by the things that you cannot.

128
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,440
 And the reason I start there is because,

129
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
 just like people thought, it was crazy at the time

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,800
 that there's this invisible world that exists out there

131
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,560
 that's impacting the visible world,

132
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,360
 when Luis Pastore introduced the idea of germs,

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,160
 or germ theory, in the same way,

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,640
 the Bible says there's another invisible world,

135
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,520
 that it's not just the invisible world of germs,

136
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,140
 and bacteria, and disease, and things like that,

137
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,020
 there is a visible or invisible world

138
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,360
 that is impacting the visible world in which we live,

139
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,000
 and there is this spiritual, unseen realm

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 that just like germs, and just like people thought,

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,520
 oh, that's crazy, just in that same way,

142
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,800
 the Bible says it's impacting the world in which we live,

143
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
 and in the world in which you and I inhabit.

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,480
 And just like with Pastore, the more the belief

145
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,960
 in germ theory kinda caught on,

146
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
 the more things began to make sense,

147
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,380
 because they began to sterilize utensils

148
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,800
 when they did surgery, they began to change

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
 kind of behavior, began to not shake hands with someone

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
 when they were sick, and all of a sudden,

151
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,200
 people stopped getting sick as much.

152
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,280
 And things began to make sense, it's like,

153
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,540
 oh, that makes sense why we get sick,

154
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,640
 I was around, I shared the same room,

155
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,440
 or drink, or cup with this person who was sick,

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,640
 and all of a sudden, it clicked into place.

157
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,700
 Tonight, and for the next few weeks,

158
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,780
 we're gonna study the idea of this unseen realm,

159
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,040
 what the Bible says about it, and in doing so,

160
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,200
 so much of your experience, my experience in life,

161
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,960
 all of a sudden becomes to come to focus,

162
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
 so much of the world around us,

163
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,880
 and the craziness that's there, begins to make sense.

164
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,040
 And also, just like, Pastore didn't cure germs.

165
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,680
 Like, he didn't come up with the cure for germs,

166
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
 all he did was expose the reality that they exist.

167
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,740
 There's these invisible, you can't see 'em,

168
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,200
 and I don't have a cure for 'em,

169
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,920
 but I'm gonna at least expose you to the truth

170
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,960
 that they're there.

171
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,800
 And what we're gonna do tonight,

172
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,240
 through the Apostle Paul and the teachings

173
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,600
 of the Scriptures, is be exposed to the reality

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,160
 and the truth that there is an invisible realm,

175
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,840
 and it is impacting your world.

176
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
 It is impacting your dating life,

177
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
 it is impacting your work life,

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,400
 it is impacting your personal sin patterns, addictions,

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,960
 it is impacting the way that you view yourself,

180
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,120
 it is impacting arenas of life, even beyond you.

181
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,000
 It is impacting your parents' marriage,

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,560
 it is impacting the national perspective

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
 of our country right now.

184
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
 There's all these different layers,

185
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,440
 and they're being impacted,

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
 and we're just gonna expose ourselves,

187
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,160
 just like Pastor didn't cure it,

188
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,880
 he just exposed that it's there.

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,040
 Hopefully in the next few minutes,

190
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,240
 we are going to expose ourselves to it there,

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 and in the weeks ahead, begin to explore

192
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,640
 what it's like to live inside of the seen world

193
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,600
 in light of the unseen world that's there.

194
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,920
 So we're gonna look at three ideas from the text,

195
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,760
 three ideas from the text.

196
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,120
 We're gonna be in Ephesians chapter six for the first one,

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,840
 and we'll dive in, really, to the idea

198
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,360
 of how there is an unseen realm.

199
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,520
 There is an unseen reason

200
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,640
 for the evil that exists inside of our world,

201
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,960
 and there is an unseen enemy

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,080
 that exists inside of all of this.

203
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
 Tonight is a little unusual in that a lot of times,

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,200
 what we will do is we will try to take a topic

205
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,000
 and go super heavy application

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 on what it looks like to live this out.

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
 Tonight's a little bit more of less,

208
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,320
 hey, here's what to do, and here's what to know,

209
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,600
 as we just frame up what the Bible has to say

210
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,280
 about this unseen world that is there for all of us.

211
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,920
 So we're gonna be Ephesians chapter six,

212
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,080
 verse 12, we'll dive right in.

213
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,040
 Here's what it says.

214
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,440
 Paul speaking, he's writing to the Ephesian church,

215
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
 and he just finished six chapters of a letter

216
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
 where he just walked through,

217
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
 here's what it looks like to live out the Christian faith,

218
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 and then in chapter five,

219
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
 he goes into all these different nuances.

220
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,080
 Here's what it looks like to be Christian husbands,

221
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,760
 and then in chapter six, Christians at work,

222
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,720
 and Christians as Christian wives and children,

223
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
 and all these different things,

224
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,260
 and he says, here's what the church does there,

225
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,560
 and here's the church's enemy,

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,640
 and the church's battleground.

227
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,040
 Here's what he says, verse 12.

228
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,840
 For our struggle, or the word is literally

229
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,280
 like our hand-to-hand combat, our battle,

230
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,360
 is not against flesh and blood.

231
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,920
 It's not against the physical world.

232
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,280
 It's not a battle against the people that live next to you,

233
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
 your coworkers, the person in the cube next to you,

234
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
 or the apartment above you that annoys you.

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,760
 Our flesh and blood is not, Paul says,

236
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
 where the battle takes place,

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,240
 but it is against the rulers and authorities,

238
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,400
 against the powers of this dark world,

239
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,160
 and against the spiritual forces of evil

240
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,640
 in the heavenly realm that Paul says,

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,120
 hey, look, the battle that you and I as Christians,

242
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
 if we engage, I mean, think about how crazy this is.

243
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
 He says it's not against flesh and blood.

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,840
 It's not against a political party.

245
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,360
 It's not against ISIS.

246
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,040
 It's not against the individuals

247
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,720
 that you see paraded all over the news.

248
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
 It's not against your old boyfriend,

249
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,040
 or your old girlfriend, or whoever in your past

250
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
 betrayed and hurt you.

251
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,360
 He says you and I's battle is against those

252
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
 who are in the spirit, there's these spiritual forces

253
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
 that are in this invisible world,

254
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,920
 but they are impacting the visible world.

255
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,080
 There is a spiritual component to the problems

256
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,220
 in your life and in my life.

257
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,740
 There is a spiritual dimension to the problems

258
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,340
 in our country right now.

259
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,320
 I mean, it is crazy.

260
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
 If it's your first time back in church in a while,

261
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,960
 and you're like, dude, what is this invisible world?

262
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,200
 Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

263
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
 What in the world, where am I right now?

264
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,760
 (laughing)

265
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,160
 He is addressing that there is a spiritual dimension

266
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,840
 to every single problem that you and I face

267
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,320
 inside of our life, which is crucial.

268
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
 He's basically saying, look, you need to understand

269
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
 what the problem is, because if you don't know

270
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,360
 what the problem is, you can't essentially

271
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,680
 apply the right solution, right?

272
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
 We know this.

273
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,240
 If a person does not accurately understand the problem,

274
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,040
 they cannot accurately diagnose the problem,

275
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,160
 they can't accurately give a prescription

276
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
 or a solution to what's wrong.

277
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,960
 No one would be excited about going to a doctor

278
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,360
 and going into the waiting room,

279
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,840
 and then waiting and seeing the doctor,

280
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,480
 and you go in there, and you have these symptoms,

281
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,400
 and you're excited, hey, can you give me something?

282
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,880
 And you walk into his office, and he just says,

283
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,640
 man, here, take this prescription, it'll be great.

284
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,040
 Wait, you haven't heard my symptoms.

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,680
 Ah, it's kind of one size fits all.

286
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,600
 Which one, you want another one?

287
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,420
 Here you go.

288
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,760
 You would not think that's a good doctor,

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,160
 'cause he doesn't understand the problem.

290
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,720
 And if you do not understand the problem,

291
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,560
 Paul would say, which is why, I mean, think about it.

292
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,560
 Why are you telling them this, Paul?

293
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,160
 Why are you telling the Ephesian church this?

294
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,440
 Because Paul wants to make sure that they and we

295
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,840
 understand that the problems that you and I face

296
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,680
 are much deeper than what you see on the surface.

297
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
 There is a spiritual component.

298
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,160
 In other words, the solution that you and I,

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,040
 if we're gonna apply a solution to the problems

300
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,160
 that you and I see in our world,

301
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,720
 it has to involve a spiritual component to things.

302
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
 Let me say it another way.

303
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,400
 The problems, let's just take a few of the examples

304
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
 and set up a word.

305
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,440
 We live in a world that thinks if we just educate enough,

306
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
 and if we just give enough time, and enough science,

307
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
 and we pass the right laws,

308
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,400
 then a lot of the problems will go away.

309
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,240
 Racism will not go away with enough education,

310
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,120
 and enough time, and enough laws.

311
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
 You cannot change the heart by legislation.

312
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,720
 Only the law of love can change the heart.

313
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,160
 There's a spiritual component that has to be changed.

314
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,080
 What happened this weekend in Charlottesville

315
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,040
 is not something that any legislation can change.

316
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,040
 And it's not, if we take everyone that we think is a racist

317
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,120
 and we throw 'em in jail and call 'em crazy,

318
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,920
 it will not deal with the problem

319
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
 because evil's gonna manifest itself everywhere.

320
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,320
 There's a spiritual dimension, poverty.

321
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
 Education alone will not fix the problem of poverty

322
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
 inside of our country.

323
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,160
 The problem with abortion and the tragedy

324
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,640
 that it is on our land is not something that will be fixed

325
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,720
 by enough laws that could be taking place.

326
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,080
 If it was, man, we should all quit

327
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,560
 and go join the government.

328
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,840
 But even if they pass the law,

329
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,920
 there's still gonna be segments and places in society

330
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,000
 where you can go and illegally do it.

331
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,360
 The thing that will stop the day that abortion ends

332
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,640
 in our country will be the day

333
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,800
 that Jesus captures the heart of people.

334
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,240
 The thing that will end racism inside of the country

335
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,660
 is not when education finally takes root,

336
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,440
 it is when Jesus captures the hearts of people.

337
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,860
 The thing that will get rid of ISIS is not a nuclear bomb,

338
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,560
 it will be when Jesus captures the heart of people.

339
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,800
 Paul says if you don't understand the problem,

340
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,520
 you will not apply the right solution.

341
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,080
 There is a spiritual, unseen component

342
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
 that is a part of all the different problems

343
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
 inside of your world.

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,720
 The collapse of marriage and the family.

345
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,760
 I read a report today that 57% of parents

346
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,040
 between the age 26 and 31, millennials,

347
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,160
 57% are single parent wedlock children.

348
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
 Those are the babies that are being born.

349
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,100
 That's a majority taking place.

350
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,760
 That is not a problem that will be fixed

351
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,720
 by more birth control and more education.

352
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
 It is a problem that will only be fixed

353
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,480
 when Jesus captures the heart.

354
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,120
 Paul says do not be fooled.

355
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,280
 There is a spiritual world, an unseen world,

356
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,560
 and it is impacting this world.

357
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,360
 And the victory and change has to include

358
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,000
 a spiritual component to it.

359
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,080
 Our first idea from the text is simply that

360
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,780
 there is a spiritual realm, Paul says.

361
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,640
 And in addition to that, he then goes on to

362
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,560
 not only is there this spiritual realm

363
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,880
 that's influencing and impacting the world

364
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
 in which we live in, but he says this,

365
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,680
 there is a spiritual reason or an unseen reason

366
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,280
 for so much of the evil that exists in our world.

367
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,180
 He says this in verse 10, the verse right before it in 11.

368
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,720
 As Paul began to launch into the verse that we just read,

369
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,480
 he says, "Finally, be strong in the Lord

370
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,180
 "and in his mighty power, and put on the full armor of God

371
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,100
 "so that you may take your stand

372
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,060
 "against the devil's schemes."

373
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,280
 Put on the full armor of God so that you may take

374
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,640
 your stand against the devil's schemes.

375
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,560
 Paul, are you saying that there's a devil out there

376
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,760
 that is scheming against me, against the church,

377
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,880
 against Christians, against humanity, against people?

378
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,180
 Yes, he would say.

379
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,520
 There's an unseen reason for the evil inside of our world

380
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,640
 that you and I see, and it's Satan, it's a devil.

381
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,920
 Jesus would say, and so if you're skeptical,

382
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,120
 like man, is it really a devil?

383
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,160
 Jesus, in John chapter eight, would say that

384
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
 there is a devil who is out there, who is an enemy.

385
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,760
 He's been a murderer from the beginning.

386
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
 He wants to murder you.

387
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,280
 He hates you, he's a liar.

388
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,660
 Jesus literally says his only language,

389
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,000
 he's fluent in lying, that's all that he speaks.

390
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
 Jesus says there is an enemy, and he's here to kill you,

391
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,040
 he's here to kill anything good about humanity,

392
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,560
 anything good inside of your life,

393
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,400
 he wants to destroy it, Jesus says,

394
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,960
 that there is a reason for the evil inside of our world,

395
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
 and it is ultimately sin and Satan,

396
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,440
 and here we're just discussing Satan,

397
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,000
 who heads up the spiritual forces of darkness

398
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,080
 inside of our world, and you may be like,

399
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,600
 man, really, we're talking about the devil?

400
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 Do we really believe this exists?

401
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
 Because we, less and less, inside of our country,

402
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
 people believe it exists.

403
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
 Here's what I would say quickly.

404
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
 As we've said before, man,

405
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,720
 the reason why I'm convinced there's a devil

406
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,600
 is because Jesus was, and I'm not the smartest guy

407
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,440
 in the room, but when a guy can predict

408
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,640
 his own death and resurrection, and then pull it off,

409
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,080
 I just go with whatever he says.

410
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,360
 I'm like, all right, there's a devil, I'm with him, okay?

411
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,000
 He said, you know, he died and he came back alive,

412
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,120
 and I can't do it, I'm gonna go with him, all right?

413
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
 Can you do that?

414
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,600
 If so, let's talk afterwards.

415
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,640
 And so Jesus lays out, and so if you're curious,

416
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,680
 if you're like, man, that's crazy,

417
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,760
 the reason we do is because Jesus did.

418
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,760
 And Jesus said there is a reason, and there is an enemy,

419
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,000
 and a real enemy who hates you,

420
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
 and he wants to kill anything good inside of your life.

421
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
 He does not want you to know God.

422
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,560
 He wants to destroy your dating relationship.

423
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,760
 He wants you to get so addicted to pornography

424
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,160
 that you cannot look at women without lusting.

425
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,280
 You cannot imagine them without beginning to take

426
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,120
 and address them in your mind.

427
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,960
 That's what he wants.

428
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,560
 He wants to destroy your dating life

429
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,880
 so that you date poorly, and then you marry poorly,

430
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,080
 and then he wants you to get a divorce.

431
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,880
 He loves divorce.

432
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,120
 He hates when couples date well.

433
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
 He wants to kill anything good in your life.

434
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
 He wants you to experience just like an idolatry at work

435
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,480
 where you begin to get so busy, you're like,

436
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,280
 man, I just can't really get plugged into church right now

437
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,560
 because I'm just too busy.

438
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,400
 He hates it when you get plugged into church.

439
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,040
 He hates it when you're in community.

440
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,640
 He hates it when you live in the life.

441
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
 He hates it when you live and experience your purpose.

442
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
 Like, he wants you to be so busy,

443
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,840
 I really can't serve the church

444
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,720
 or inside of the city right now.

445
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,240
 I really can't be a part of God's expression of goodness

446
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,040
 in the city that I live because I'm busy right now

447
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,880
 trying to build my career.

448
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
 Satan loves that.

449
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,880
 Anything he can do to get you off mission.

450
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,360
 If he can't kill you, he will do everything he can

451
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,640
 to stop you from being effective for Christ.

452
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,840
 And Jesus says he's a murderer, he's a liar,

453
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,120
 and he deceives, he twists things.

454
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,000
 He takes good things and makes them God things.

455
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,240
 He takes things like, man, the gift of marriage,

456
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,600
 and all of a sudden, he puts that in front of you

457
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,880
 in a way that you can't think about anything other

458
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,200
 than when am I gonna get married?

459
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
 Every time I get a wedding invitation, I'm ticked.

460
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
 I can't believe that they got engaged

461
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,560
 and they asked me to take the picture.

462
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,600
 Anytime anything like that happens, you're like, great.

463
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,440
 And he says, man, anything I can do,

464
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,800
 I'm gonna infuse gossip.

465
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,880
 He loves when people gossip.

466
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,320
 He hates when they are lovingly or honestly

467
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,400
 just are direct and truthful with one another.

468
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,880
 He loves division.

469
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,560
 Jesus says he hates you and he'll do anything he can

470
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,340
 to distort and just subtly twist things.

471
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,520
 I mean, it doesn't take much to look around at a world

472
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,800
 and see some of the twisting that's taking place.

473
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
 And I'm not trying to get political here,

474
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,280
 but we kinda continue to look at things

475
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,080
 that seem to be somewhat black and white.

476
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,000
 It could be wrong.

477
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,500
 I don't think I am 'cause the Bible says it.

478
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,360
 But when you look at a man and a woman

479
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,440
 and people being like, no, doesn't tell the whole story.

480
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,840
 They could've been born with something different.

481
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,440
 We don't really know if that's a man and a woman.

482
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,480
 And so, what do they think?

483
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,140
 And that's insane.

484
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,920
 And if you don't think that's insane, I understand why.

485
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,360
 Because we live in this world where the prince

486
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,160
 of the power of the air, which is what the Bible says,

487
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,880
 has begun to really so convolute the perspectives

488
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,000
 that even a man and a woman were like, eh, not sure.

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,800
 That's insane.

490
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,080
 And it's just twisted.

491
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,240
 Well, how do they feel?

492
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,660
 It's twisted.

493
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,760
 The Bible says that Satan, not only that,

494
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 he is seeking to ensnare or trap you and me and sin.

495
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,900
 Like, whatever it is.

496
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,680
 It doesn't have to be some extreme, like, hey, man,

497
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,000
 I'm gonna get you addicted on heroin.

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,840
 It doesn't have to be that.

499
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,400
 Like, he may just be like, hey, I'm just gonna make you

500
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,320
 comfortable and so distracted.

501
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,440
 I'm gonna make that relationship you're in so dysfunctional

502
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
 you really can't focus on anyone and anything other

503
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,560
 than you and your boyfriend.

504
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,380
 Or you and her.

505
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,520
 Hey, I'm gonna make you so, like, insecure about the way

506
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,160
 that you look that any time you're around people,

507
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,720
 all you think about is, like, what do they think about me

508
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,560
 and how do I look right now?

509
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,400
 And gosh, I'm so insecure or so overly proud of how you look

510
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,960
 that all you can think about is, I wonder what they think

511
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,800
 about me?

512
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,400
 And he'll do whatever he can to trap and ensnare.

513
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,040
 Second Timothy chapter two, verse 26, literally says

514
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,760
 that the enemy is looking to trap you and I.

515
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,880
 Like, he's setting a trap.

516
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,720
 Think about that.

517
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,840
 Like, a year and a half ago, we lived in this place

518
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,920
 that had rats inside of it.

519
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,920
 And, like, rats, unbelievably impressive rats.

520
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,080
 Let me just say this.

521
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,160
 They would come into our home at night.

522
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,520
 Like, I'm not saying, like, they're in the attic

523
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
 and we can hear them and it's a little bit like,

524
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,960
 oh, man, they were in our living room.

525
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,840
 They were literally, they would come in at night

526
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,880
 and we would hear them 'cause they would get in

527
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,720
 through some of the plumbing, we would hear them out there

528
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,880
 and they'd go through into the kitchen.

529
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,280
 They would go in, they chewed through the Tupperware

530
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
 that holds the dog food in there.

531
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
 And we came through and we saw, like, I know,

532
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,560
 like, Swarzerat, that's unbelievable.

533
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,120
 And then they'd be gone in the morning, so disgusting.

534
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,160
 So eventually, somebody was like, dude,

535
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
 here's what you gotta do.

536
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,600
 You gotta get this trap, it'll get rid of 'em.

537
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
 And then once you kill one, you just pull it back,

538
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,080
 put another piece of cheese or food in there

539
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,320
 and then let it go again.

540
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,560
 And so, little bit of skeptical, ended up going

541
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,600
 and getting the trap, put it in our house

542
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,920
 and then set it out and sure enough, man,

543
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,640
 the next day, snap, there was one and it was gone.

544
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,800
 And you come up and it's honestly,

545
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,720
 it's a pretty good feeling.

546
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
 I'm not gonna lie to you.

547
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 (audience laughing)

548
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,760
 And there's something about rats

549
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
 where it just doesn't feel bad, you know?

550
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,120
 Like, you squash a roly-poly, you're like,

551
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,840
 oh, come on, little guy, but a rat, you're like,

552
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
 yeah, you deserve this.

553
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,520
 And so, but here's what would always happen.

554
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,720
 Like, you'd think that the other rats would be like,

555
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,080
 oh man, I saw, you know, cousin Sal die.

556
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
 We shouldn't eat the cheese.

557
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,720
 And they would, and they would come

558
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,800
 and you'd set it out again and sure enough,

559
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
 despite the fact that they just saw, you know,

560
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,720
 whoever get taken out, Aunt Sally,

561
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,840
 just, we lost another one the next day.

562
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,900
 Boom, snapped again.

563
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,000
 The Bible says, like, this is so haunting almost

564
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,480
 that you and I are the rats and Satan is setting out traps

565
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,560
 and despite the fact that people see marriages

566
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,320
 get taken out, they see addictions begin to take place,

567
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,200
 they see people getting checked into rehab

568
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,080
 because, you know, they just kind of drank on the weekend

569
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,960
 and then they couldn't stop.

570
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,460
 One after one, Satan says, man, they see 'em get taken out,

571
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,760
 but I'll take whatever trap I have to

572
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,640
 'cause they're gonna fall for the bait.

573
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,800
 They're gonna get lured and enticed by their own desires.

574
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,200
 They're gonna take whatever,

575
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,400
 insert, fill in the blank for you what that is.

576
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,040
 Whether it's pride, sex,

577
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,720
 whatever's gonna pull them away from God,

578
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,360
 distract them from the things that really matter.

579
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,280
 Man, I'm gonna set the bait, set the traps.

580
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
 And he is doing it and seeking to kill.

581
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,560
 And Jesus says, man, if he cannot kill you

582
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,600
 and if you're a believer in Christ,

583
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,880
 ultimately your eternal destiny is secure,

584
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,580
 but he will do everything he can to make you less effective

585
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,720
 and make you experience not hell for eternity,

586
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,520
 hell on earth and me hell on earth.

587
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,260
 And he is seeking to destroy you and I.

588
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,340
 James, the brother of Jesus,

589
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,100
 then finishes really our final idea.

590
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,840
 So there's this unseen realm,

591
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,560
 there's this unseen reason for evil inside of a world,

592
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,680
 an enemy called Satan.

593
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,960
 And then there's this unseen enemy that is within us.

594
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,840
 James, the brother of Jesus says,

595
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,760
 he says this in chapter one of James one, verse 14,

596
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 it says, but each person is tempted.

597
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,840
 So he's going into like,

598
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,320
 hey, you wanna know how temptation happens

599
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
 in your life and in my life?

600
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,160
 When you experience temptation, here's what happens.

601
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,880
 When they are dragged away by their own evil desire.

602
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,680
 Wait a second, James, what?

603
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,360
 Evil desire, that feels a little harsh.

604
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,240
 Yes, every person has an evil desire within them,

605
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,360
 has evil desires within them.

606
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,800
 The word, and it's not a Greek,

607
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,920
 it's not just this like, oh, they have this one evil desire.

608
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,160
 It's this idea of like, they have this evil, sinful nature

609
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,560
 that will lure them and entice them away, James says.

610
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,600
 And it's when this happens,

611
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,720
 that they're beginning to be tempted.

612
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,760
 In other words, when someone's tempted,

613
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,800
 it's because this sinful nature inside of them

614
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,960
 begins to be appealed or enticed.

615
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,320
 And he says, this is what happens then.

616
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,640
 And then after it's enticed,

617
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,820
 then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.

618
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,200
 And when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death

619
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,000
 that James said, what's behind so much of the temptation

620
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,880
 inside of your life and inside of my life,

621
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,600
 he doesn't even mention the devil.

622
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,040
 Now, Satan may use the sinful nature

623
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,000
 or evil desires within all of us,

624
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,960
 but he says, you and I have this other enemy

625
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,760
 that's not outside of us, it's inside of us

626
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,360
 that is trying to lead us astray.

627
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,080
 And trying, and he says, and if you let it drive the car,

628
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,680
 it's gonna drive you off the road.

629
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,320
 It's gonna drive me off the road.

630
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,400
 That if you and I embrace a lifestyle that,

631
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,920
 man, or just a belief, it's so common of like,

632
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,600
 do whatever feels good and you do you,

633
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,880
 and you were born this way.

634
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,280
 When you and I do that, he says,

635
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,680
 you're going to drive your own life off the rails.

636
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,160
 You hurt yourself.

637
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,640
 Our third idea is the unseen enemy within you.

638
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,600
 There's this unseen enemy within you.

639
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
 The battle doesn't just take place against,

640
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,440
 the devil made me do it.

641
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,240
 He would say, man, you have an evil desire.

642
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,760
 You have evil desires inside of you.

643
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
 There's something just broken

644
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,160
 that exists inside of you and inside of me.

645
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,460
 It's not dissimilar, like if you've ever driven a car

646
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,700
 where the alignment is off.

647
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,160
 Maybe some of you drove here tonight,

648
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,860
 your alignment's off, and what happens is it's like,

649
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,040
 you take your hands off the wheel,

650
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,360
 you're going out into the next lane, right?

651
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 I mean, the Bible presents this picture of humanity

652
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,840
 that every single one of us,

653
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,120
 the steering wheel of our heart is broken.

654
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,240
 And James says, if you just allow the heart that you have

655
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,440
 to drive you wherever it says you should go,

656
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,400
 you will drive yourself off the road and into a ditch.

657
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,120
 You will deceive yourself,

658
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,160
 you will destroy any arena of life

659
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,320
 where you allow just whatever you feel like

660
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,720
 to be the deciding factor.

661
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,120
 That you're gonna live a life where you end up

662
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,160
 being not someone who's in control of it,

663
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
 but being controlled by whatever desires,

664
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,560
 whatever feelings that you have.

665
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,320
 And he says, man, it eventually will bring out death.

666
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,240
 Here's where I think we get stuck, is we're like, dude,

667
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,160
 wait a second, you're telling me that eventually,

668
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,720
 if sin is there, it conceives, it brings forth death,

669
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
 like sin brings death around?

670
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,000
 I feel like, you know, last weekend, and I'm not dead.

671
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
 So how is that true?

672
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,480
 Like, I've sinned before, I've clearly sinned before,

673
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,040
 we all have, and I'm not dead.

674
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,840
 What James lays out, what the Bible teaches is this,

675
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,920
 and this may bring a lot of clarity for you

676
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,960
 if you have wondered, that idea of like, sin brings death.

677
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,560
 What the Bible teaches is that sin is like a cancer.

678
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,080
 Sin is like a cancer in that it kills

679
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
 everything that it touches.

680
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,840
 If you allow it inside of your dating life,

681
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,080
 it begins to kill the relationship,

682
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,960
 it begins to kill your own self-worth.

683
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,760
 It begins to manifest in all kinds of these different growths

684
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,480
 and things like codependency and anxiety and control.

685
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,920
 It begins to spread like an infection,

686
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,640
 that whatever it touches, sin is the reason,

687
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,700
 and if you're like, man, sin brings and kills

688
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,840
 anything it touches, it killed my parents' marriage.

689
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,000
 Maybe you're like that.

690
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,840
 Sin is the reason why so much of the addiction

691
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,480
 that is just rampant in our country is taking place.

692
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,320
 Because sin has killed their ability to be self-controlled.

693
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,640
 Sin will kill anything that it touches inside of your life

694
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,480
 and inside of my life.

695
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,800
 Sin will kill your ability to look at a woman

696
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,760
 and not undress her in your head.

697
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,080
 Sin will kill your ability to live without alcohol.

698
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,760
 I mean, anything that it touches,

699
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,440
 sin will kill your relationships.

700
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,880
 Sin will kill your friendships.

701
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,640
 Sin wants to kill your friendships.

702
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,880
 And James says, be aware there's an enemy within you

703
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,900
 that must be kept in check, it must be kept in check,

704
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,640
 because it is going to hurt and kill you.

705
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
 Proverbs 14, 12 says there's a way

706
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,200
 that seems right to people.

707
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,560
 Like it's a way, they're like, yeah,

708
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,420
 I think this is the way we should go, let's go.

709
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,760
 And in the end, it leads to death.

710
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,080
 It only hurts them.

711
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,640
 I mean, it's not hard to like see this, isn't it?

712
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,120
 Like think of how many of the behaviors that we do,

713
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,000
 that we do them and we regret them

714
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,520
 and then we do them again.

715
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,080
 And they're only hurting us.

716
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,920
 Like, man, this is the last time we are not having sex,

717
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,880
 and then you had sex the next weekend.

718
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,640
 Hey, man, this is the last time, you know,

719
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,960
 we're going out tonight, but really,

720
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,520
 I think I'm gonna give up alcohol for, you know,

721
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,400
 the next month, gotta clean it up a little bit.

722
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
 And then the next weekend comes, you're like,

723
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,680
 ah, I'm gonna start next weekend.

724
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,060
 And on and on and on, I mean,

725
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,220
 it's decisions where we like try to take steps

726
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,060
 in a direction that we know God wants us to move,

727
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,920
 and yet for whatever reason, we talk ourselves out of it.

728
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,380
 Hey, I'm gonna get rid of the computer tomorrow.

729
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,460
 And James says, man, you are,

730
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,900
 if you allow that to control your life,

731
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,180
 you're headed towards destruction.

732
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,580
 In my own life, I see examples of like how

733
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,500
 my evil desires within me can manifest and hurt only me.

734
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,920
 We, in the last week and a half, we're like moving.

735
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,640
 We're like in this crazy season right now.

736
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,160
 So we're moving, we're renovating the home

737
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,540
 that we're living in, so we're living like

738
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,320
 in boxes downstairs, and then they're renovating

739
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,360
 the upstairs, and so we're like,

740
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
 there's construction workers everywhere,

741
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,400
 and we're like, I'm gonna change in this closet.

742
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,360
 Okay, there's another construction worker,

743
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,200
 where can I go?

744
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,880
 And so we're like just in this crazy season,

745
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,400
 and last week specifically, so we moved,

746
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,620
 and within a week and a half, we moved,

747
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,660
 we got in two wrecks in one day.

748
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,240
 Yeah, yeah, I know, and my wife has gotta learn to drive.

749
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,920
 And I know, one of 'em was me,

750
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,880
 and I know, how crazy is that?

751
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,600
 The same day, hey, I got in a wreck.

752
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,240
 Oh man, I'm so sorry, call back five.

753
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
 Hey, I got in a wreck.

754
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,320
 (congregation laughing)

755
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,800
 Dude, and then we got robbed.

756
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,920
 How crazy is that?

757
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,400
 Spiritual warfare, unseen, come on.

758
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,480
 And it may be, but all that to say,

759
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,680
 just all this craziness, and here's what happens for me.

760
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,480
 Whenever I get stressed, I get like angry,

761
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,320
 like short, and that may be crazy.

762
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,180
 You're like, huh, I thought pastors were perfect.

763
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,220
 Well, newsflash.

764
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,720
 And this was like last weekend,

765
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,640
 where my wife and I were discussing things,

766
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 and she basically was going,

767
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,160
 hey, I feel like I need more ball help with the baby.

768
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,880
 And I was like, I feel like I immediately got angry,

769
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,040
 immediately got defensive.

770
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,600
 I feel like you don't even know everything

771
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
 that I have going on, and raised my voice,

772
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,680
 yelling at my wife in front of my 20-month-old son.

773
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,460
 Why would I do that?

774
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,320
 I mean, think about it.

775
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,080
 Like even, so in the moment, it feels good,

776
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,120
 it feels justified, and I can't believe this.

777
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,280
 And then afterwards, of course, it's like,

778
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,740
 you feel ashamed, you feel embarrassed,

779
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,040
 you feel just heartbroken.

780
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,200
 And so I looped in community, asked for her forgiveness.

781
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,580
 But think about why.

782
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,080
 Like, why would I, how could that even take place?

783
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,880
 I mean, out of everyone on the entire planet,

784
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,440
 what could cause and move me towards the person

785
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,000
 that I love more than anyone else, which is my wife,

786
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,560
 raise my voice and yell in front of a 20-month-old son,

787
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,840
 and just yell at her in general?

788
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,600
 I mean, out of the two people inside of the room,

789
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,760
 like, man, there's no one who means more on the planet.

790
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,500
 Like, people, my wife and son, as in like,

791
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,580
 something happens to them, I'm not sure I make it.

792
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,760
 And here I am yelling at them?

793
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,120
 Because there's something in me, this evil desire,

794
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,800
 that if I allow it to control, I allow it to come out,

795
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,640
 will lead me, it wants to destroy my marriage,

796
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,680
 destroy my future, destroy my son's perspective

797
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,100
 on what a good father looks like.

798
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,200
 And the same thing exists in you,

799
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
 and wants to come out and destroy

800
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
 any of those different arenas.

801
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,000
 In conclusion, there is, as we just lay the really,

802
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,760
 direction for this first week, there's an unseen world,

803
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,920
 and it's impacting this one.

804
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,920
 There is an unseen reason for the evil inside of this world,

805
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,840
 and there's an unseen enemy within you,

806
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,080
 just like it's within me.

807
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,320
 Let me, I'm gonna close right here.

808
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,320
 And I think, as believers, there's this tension,

809
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,520
 because we know that, hey, the battle in Jesus,

810
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,480
 on the cross, there was this victory that was won.

811
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,560
 Like, there was this victory, and Satan ultimately

812
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,960
 was dealt this fatal wound, and ultimately,

813
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
 the victory is ours, and so, you know,

814
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
 how do we navigate, and what does that look like,

815
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,480
 and how does that impact the world in which we live?

816
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,260
 And hasn't Satan been, any power that he has been removed?

817
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,320
 Here's kinda what I think it's like.

818
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,720
 I heard this story yesterday, and I like,

819
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,000
 spent time on the phone to confirm it.

820
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,500
 It's a crazy story.

821
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,440
 And it was this guy who went to Africa,

822
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,000
 and he went on a safari trip to go hunting.

823
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
 He was a hunter, and he liked to hunt,

824
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,000
 and he went over to hunt, not like a deer, but a lion.

825
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 And he's over there, and he's sitting like,

826
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,200
 hey, you should hunt a lion.

827
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,700
 It's not really relevant to the story,

828
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,800
 whether you should or shouldn't, but he's over there,

829
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,640
 and he gets a guide, and they're going to hunt the lion.

830
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,400
 And the guide's taking him out, and eventually,

831
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,440
 they find, they see a lion.

832
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,800
 And he takes the gun, and takes a shot.

833
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,400
 And he hits the lion, but he doesn't fall over.

834
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,440
 He just wounds it, and the lion takes off running.

835
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,920
 And they'd been tracking the lion, so they saw his tracks,

836
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,460
 and that's how they had led to him.

837
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,080
 But now, not only do they have the tracks,

838
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
 they have the blood, so it should be an easy enough fall.

839
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,800
 So they begin to follow the blood, and follow the tracks,

840
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,520
 and they're following this lion.

841
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,240
 And eventually, as they're going through the path,

842
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,060
 the tracks and the blood stop, and they're like, huh.

843
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,080
 I wonder what could've happened.

844
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,040
 So they begin to continue to look,

845
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,840
 and they're walking around, and they're just,

846
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,280
 at this point, trying to just figure out

847
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,360
 where he possibly could be,

848
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,380
 'cause they don't have a trail to follow.

849
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,480
 And all of a sudden, the guide grabs the guy and says, stop.

850
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,220
 Turn around slowly.

851
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,960
 And they turn around, and there's the lion.

852
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,920
 And the lion begins to charge at them,

853
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,000
 and the guide's like, hey, I'm not taking any chances,

854
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,080
 whether you can shoot or not.

855
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,440
 You couldn't the first time, so I'm taking the gun,

856
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,600
 and he shoots the lion.

857
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,900
 And the lion dies.

858
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,440
 And they go back, and they retrace their steps,

859
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,740
 and here's what's like the crazy part,

860
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,040
 is they begin to look at the tracks,

861
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,720
 and where the lion had been, and retraced where he went,

862
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,920
 and they realize that at some point,

863
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,560
 they went from being the hunter to the hunted.

864
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,740
 And this thing, even though it had been dealt a fatal wound,

865
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,640
 was no longer something being hunted.

866
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,700
 It was hunting them, and it was gonna take them out.

867
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,360
 The Bible says that when it comes to the enemy

868
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,840
 that you and I have, which is Satan,

869
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,760
 and in addition to that, the sinful nature,

870
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,160
 which he uses and plays off of inside of all of our lives,

871
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,040
 the enemy that's there has been dealt a fatal wound

872
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,680
 by Christ on the cross, but make no mistake,

873
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,440
 he will do anything he can to take you out,

874
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,580
 and to take me out.

875
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,660
 And even though he's got a fatal, hey, I'm gonna die,

876
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,660
 I am hunting you, David, you, porch,

877
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,240
 and I will do anything that I have to

878
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,000
 to make sure that your relationship with God suffers.

879
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,400
 You don't even get a relationship with God

880
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,300
 if you don't know him.

881
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,320
 That's his desire.

882
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,920
 He will do anything to take you and I out

883
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,000
 because he hates you.

884
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,720
 And just like inside of that story where, in a moment,

885
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,380
 what allowed the guy, or what allowed the hunter

886
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,880
 to be protected was the guide said,

887
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,120
 I'm gonna take the gun, and I'm gonna finish it.

888
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,680
 I'm gonna be not only the guide, but the protector,

889
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,840
 and ultimately, the defeater of the person

890
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,220
 that's hunting us, so it is with what Jesus has done

891
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,060
 for us on the cross.

892
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,920
 That's what Christians believe.

893
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,000
 If you are not a Christian, inside of that story,

894
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,040
 you are like the hunter, without a gun,

895
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,000
 and without a guide.

896
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,040
 You do not have the superior Lion of Judah

897
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,380
 who attacks the lion that comes after, that seeks,

898
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,580
 the Bible says Satan is like a lion that seeks

899
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,580
 to devour your life and kill everything inside of it,

900
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,000
 and if you have not trusted in Jesus,

901
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,660
 you do not have that protection.

902
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,240
 The very first, one of the first verses

903
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,520
 I remember memorizing came from Psalm 91,

904
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,900
 and we're laying in the plain.

905
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,640
 Psalm 91 begins that he who dwells in the shelter

906
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,200
 of the Most High will abide with the shadow

907
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,400
 of the Almighty, or abide in the shadow of the Almighty.

908
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,240
 Here's what that means.

909
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,860
 He who abides in the shelter, or the protection of God,

910
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,280
 is close, it's like he's under the shadow of his wings.

911
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,240
 In other words, there is protection and proximity to God.

912
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,300
 There is protection and proximity to the Savior, to Jesus.

913
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,880
 Proximity both in terms of trusting and placing yourself

914
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,400
 under what he did on the cross, dying for you,

915
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
 and protection through the relationship

916
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,000
 that is strong, there's protection and proximity to Jesus,

917
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,200
 and it is in knowing him and walking with him

918
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,520
 that we have the guide who is there to protect,

919
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,440
 to show us the way, to guide us in the way

920
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,080
 that we live our relationships and our dating life

921
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,700
 and all of these things, and if you have never trusted

922
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,280
 in Jesus, the very thing that the enemy,

923
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,580
 there is a devil, listen to me right now,

924
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,640
 I want everybody to come back in,

925
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,920
 especially if you've never put your trust in Christ.

926
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,480
 There is an enemy right now who is doing anything

927
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,320
 and everything that he can to distract you.

928
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,960
 He's trying to get you to look at the girl next to you,

929
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
 he's trying to get you to look at the guy next to you,

930
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,000
 get you to be distracted by the worries

931
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,300
 of whatever's going on in your life and why,

932
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,240
 I don't like this guy, what shirt is he wearing up there?

933
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,800
 He's trying to do anything that he can

934
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,160
 to get your mind off the fact that God loves you.

935
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,000
 He died on a cross for you.

936
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,220
 Not because you deserve it,

937
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,440
 not because you could ever earn it,

938
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,240
 because he, being rich and abounding in love,

939
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,680
 the Bible says, looked at the humanity that ran from him

940
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,840
 and he ran after them and he provided the ultimate sacrifice

941
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,320
 he jumped in front of the lion of sin and Satan

942
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,360
 to die in their place, to die for you

943
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,600
 and here's what the Bible says,

944
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,080
 Satan is blinding you right now.

945
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,920
 I know that sounds crazy and weird,

946
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,560
 the Bible, 2 Corinthians chapter four, verse four says,

947
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,720
 the God of this age is blinding people

948
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,740
 who cannot see the light of Jesus.

949
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,920
 He's blinding the family members and yours and mine

950
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,200
 that don't know Jesus and when you share the faith

951
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,680
 or share the gospel, that God doesn't want anything from you

952
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,840
 but just wants you to accept, my son died on your place

953
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,900
 and he rose again.

954
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,000
 Trust in what he did and when they can't hear it

955
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,040
 and they don't receive it, it says,

956
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,360
 Satan has blinded and veiled them

957
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,060
 and in a moment of faith where they trust in him,

958
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,400
 they have unveiled faces and they're able to see Jesus

959
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,560
 as the image of God, as God who he is, the protector,

960
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,360
 the one who if you dwell in the shelter of protection

961
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,200
 and the most high, you abide in the shadow of the almighty.

962
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
 Let me pray.

963
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,760
 Father, thank you that you are

964
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:36,560
 superior to any force in this world

965
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,340
 and that you ultimately have defeated and delivered

966
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,440
 the final blow to the enemy of the human race

967
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,160
 and that all who trust and stand with you

968
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,600
 should be forever protected by their guide and their God

969
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,200
 and our savior, the Messiah and the king,

970
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,120
 the Lion of Judah who slays the lion that seeks to devour.

971
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:08,840
 Father, I pray, God, would you do something amazing

972
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,120
 in these next moments and would you open the eyes

973
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,460
 of people in the room who don't believe, Lord?

974
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,120
 Father, we as just the followers of Jesus in the room,

975
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,920
 we acknowledge that there are friends and people

976
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,400
 in our life that don't know you and we're asking, Lord,

977
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,360
 we're begging the hounds of heaven to be unleashed

978
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,840
 and pressed into the hearts of anyone here

979
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,040
 who doesn't know you and they would accept the free gift

980
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,520
 that the God who is there provides,

981
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
 the free protection that he provides

982
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,900
 through the provision of what he provided on the cross

983
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,360
 by dying in their place.

984
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,200
 Father, thank you that you love us in spite of us.

985
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,520
 Would you protect us now and forever from the unseen realm,

986
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,280
 from the unseen enemy within us.

987
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,680
 We worship you now in song.
