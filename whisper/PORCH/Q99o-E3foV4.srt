 Let's go.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
 So good to be with you.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
 Brilliant video, by the way.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Brilliant video.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 If we don't know each other, I got to spend, I guess, a little over a decade up here just kind of having a front row seat, learning about young adults,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 very passionate about the topic of relationships, made a ton of mistakes.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I'm going to share some of those with you today, still make mistakes on occasions.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'll share some of those with you today.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But I want to take you back to me in my sophomore year in high school.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I'm in anatomy class, all right, anatomy and physiology.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Anybody take anatomy?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I was failing.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I desperately needed to pass this class to graduate or to have to take it again the next year.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Had a huge crush on this girl.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I'm going to change her name, okay, to protect the innocent.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Kelly, we'll call her.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Huge crush on Kelly, all right.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 The sun would come in through the window, hit her just right.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Her blonde hair, like everything was just in place.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Like there were no crazy wispies, you know.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 It was just like everything, and she would sometimes like kind of throw it back,

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and it would throw this scent in my nose.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 She just smelled good, you know.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 She always had style.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And every now and then she'd like turn around.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I'm two rows behind her.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 She has these huge dimples, you know, and I'd catch a glimpse of that smile.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 It made me just feel all kinds of crazy ways.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I'm failing the class because I'm studying the wrong anatomy.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 [laughter]

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And so here's what's going to happen.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 There is a big project, and I need to get an A on this project to pass the class.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 It's all coming down to this moment, and the teacher is pairing people up.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 A guy with a girl, a guy with a girl, a guy with a girl.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So I become very religious, and I start, "Lord in heaven, God,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 please put me with Kelly.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 God, please, like if you can hear me, put me--partner us up.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 May she be my partner.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Lord, would you please do that?"

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Teacher, Ms. Peruthi, starts going around the room, you know,

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 "Jennifer and Sean, Kimberly and Travis, Kelly,"

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 and I'm like, "And Jonathan and Jonathan and Jonathan."

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 That's my real name.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 "And Jonathan," and she says, "And Jonathan."

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 [applause]

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Like this is the story we're going to tell people.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 That's what I'm thinking.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 You know, they're going to be like, "How did y'all meet?"

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 When our two kids, Tyler and, you know, a cool girl's name.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 [laughter]

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 When we're just hanging--they'll be like, "How'd you meet?"

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 I'll be like, "Well, we were in anatomy class," you know.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And so there we are.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 We're partnered up.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 This is awesome, and here's the problem.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I didn't consider the assignment.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I didn't know the assignment.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 We were going to be dissecting frogs,

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 and we were going to be graded on our partner's participation,

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 how we got to share responsibilities.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Now, I knew how Kelly's hair smelled.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I knew about her dimples.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I knew about her style.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I didn't know that she didn't like frogs.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 She didn't want to touch any kind of frogs,

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 especially the dead ones.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 She didn't want to get frog juice on her, right?

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And here's what that meant is when we kind of partnered up

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 and we got the scalpel and we stood at the table,

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 she didn't want anything to do with it.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And I was like, "No, no, no, no.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 You don't understand.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I need you to be really, really good at this."

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And she's like, "That's too bad.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I'm not touching that thing."

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And so I failed the class.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I want to ask you two questions up front.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Why did I fail the class?

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Because I didn't understand the assignment.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 On what criteria did I want Kelly to be my partner

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 for the assignment?

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 What was she bringing to the table?

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 What would you say?

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 She was pretty.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 That was the skills and capabilities that she had there

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 in anatomy class.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 She was pretty.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And I'm here to tell you that her beauty did not benefit me

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 at all when it comes to dissecting a frog

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 or the assignment that was in front of us.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And I think when it comes to marriage,

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 that men do not consider the assignment

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 when they're choosing a partner.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I believe this is one of the biggest problems

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 in dating today, that we have been brainwashed

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 to look for the wrong things.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I get it.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You want her to look like Zendaya or Kendall Jenner,

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 have Sadie's faith and Taylor's game, right?

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And you want her to work out and be fit

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 but not be able to beat you in pig, right?

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And so you have all of this criteria.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 You want her to have style but not kind of out,

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 you know, to look good at the party with you.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 You want your boys to be jealous that you're with her.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And if you're honest, your number one criteria,

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 even in those of you that have studied the Scripture,

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 you've memorized the Bible, you go to church,

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 you're a member, you're in a small group,

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 your number one criteria is how she looks.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It's not serving you well.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I was enslaved to pornography.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Enslaved to it.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I would take off work to look at porn.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I am here to tell you that that epidemic

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 is bleeding throughout the culture

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and ruining your marriage

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 long before you even met your girlfriend,

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 long before you've even met the prospect.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And you continue to move through that.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 You struggle with porn and masturbation

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 and all of a sudden you look up and you're like,

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 "How long have I been struggling with this?

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 "Oh, it's been since the fifth grade

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 "and I've not done anything about it."

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And so we're in this series, his and hers.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And today I want to talk, tonight I want to talk with you

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 about his pursuit of a wife.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 The message is what to look for, guys.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 The message is who to be, ladies.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Right when I say that, who to be, ladies,

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 shame, guilt, oh, here we go, eye roll.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 You know, this is you, Proverbs 31.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Calm down, I know, I heard you.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 All right, calm down, take a deep breath.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I've got no agenda.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Whoever finds a wife finds what is good

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 and receives favor from the Lord, Proverbs 18.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Men, if you're here and you desire a wife,

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 I want you to find what is good.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's not arrogance, I hope it's not.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I hope I can stand before you in all humility.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I care deeply about you.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I'm so sick of doing marriage counseling.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I'm so sick of talking someone through divorce.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I'm a simple guy, okay, I'm not the smartest guy in the room,

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 but I have seen a lot of relationships.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 I've seen what works, I've seen what doesn't.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I've studied a culture, I've seen where we're moving.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I've had the opportunity to write a book on this, okay.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I've arranged couples, I've done more marriages,

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 more weddings than I can count.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 That's who's talking to you.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I'm not saying that to boast, I'm just saying, listen,

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and by the way, for the last 20-something years,

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I've been a student of this book,

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 and I have found it just proven perfectly

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 when it comes to relationships.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 You do what it says, you are blessed.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 You go against what it says, it doesn't go well for you.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Time and time and time and time again, test me.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I'll be right here afterwards, and I don't mean this arrogantly.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I'm not picking a fight with you.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I'm just saying I'll be right here afterwards.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 If I'm wrong about any of that, you come right here, show me.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I'll stop saying it.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I'll stop saying it.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But if you find something true in here,

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 because some of you, you've got an attitude,

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 and it's just going to keep you single.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And then all of a sudden you act like you don't want marriage.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Yeah, I don't even need that.

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I don't even need no guy.

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 I'm like, good, that's going to work out for you.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 You know?

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And my only heart is to help you.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Okay, I'm not the bad guy.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So when I say something and it sounds old-fashioned,

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 hang in there with me.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Be patient with me.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Let me explain it.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 I am indeed going to be in your favorite chapter of Proverbs 31.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 [laughter]

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 When I was your age,

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 and I'm always hesitant to tell too much of my story.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I mean, like I'll tell you anything,

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 but I think people are going to be like, well, it worked out for you.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 You don't understand the scars.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You don't understand the pain.

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 You don't understand the sleepless nights.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You don't understand the anxiety.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You don't understand the road to this point.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Okay, when I was your age,

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I was so enslaved to pornography that I wanted someone that looked like a porn star.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Because I thought, I was just so dumb,

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 that I thought marriage was about sex,

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and I thought sex was better with an attractive person.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Now some of you are going to be thinking about that for the rest of the time.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Is it better than with a--

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Come back with me.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Here's the problem.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 In marriage, if you have a healthy, thriving sex life,

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 a healthy, thriving, better than average sex life,

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 you're going to have sex 0.6% of the time.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 That's 0.6% of the time.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Okay, so you better be really good at the other 99.4% stuff.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Okay, yeah, preach it.

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You've got to be really, really good at that stuff.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Okay, so let's dive in.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I'm going to be in Proverbs 31.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Let me set this up.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 As you guys think about who you're looking for,

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I just see so much paralysis by analysis.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 You have this fear of missing out.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Well, what if I pass up--

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 What if I commit myself to her and then someone else better comes along?

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Someone else better will come along.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 There's always someone prettier, someone nicer, someone kinder,

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 someone who likes you more.

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 You're always going to meet that person.

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 You're not trying to find the best person.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 You're trying to find a godly person, a God-fearing person,

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 someone who God has her heart.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And I'm just telling you, if you can flip that switch in your mind,

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 it's going to serve you very well.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Proverbs 31 was not written to women.

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Contrary to popular belief, it was written to men.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Anyone know who wrote it?

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Huh?

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Solomon.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 What?

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 King Lemuel.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 King Lemuel is a popular answer.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I thought that for a long time.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Did you know we have no historical evidence of a king named Lemuel?

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 That that name means "devoted to God,"

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 which means these words that you're about to read were spoken probably by Solomon's mom,

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 who is a character that you may have heard of named Bathsheba.

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Proverbs 31 is a poem.

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's an acrostic.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 There's 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And so as you work down the line, every sentence starts with the first Hebrew letter,

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 like "A" is for apple, as an example.

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 That's the kind of poem that Proverbs 31 is.

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And it's to teach you, and when we start here in verse 10,

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 it's to instruct a guy of what the golden standard of a woman is.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Now, ladies, listen, because I'm going to say this a few times,

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 because afterwards you're going to say, "I didn't say it enough."

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 It's not all non-negotiables.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It's okay.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Like if some of them, you're like, "Oh, I fall short there."

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That's okay.

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That's okay.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 God is still good.

261
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It doesn't mean that you're cursed and no one's ever going to find you.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 That's not what that means.

263
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 There may be some things that I say that you go, "Oh, I can work on that."

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "Oh, yeah, I bet I can get better at that."

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 "Oh, there might be some areas for improvement."

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 There's really only two non-negotiables today, and the first one is for the guys.

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 So I'm going to give you six points.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It's a note-taker sermon.

269
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Write these down, okay?

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Six things to look for in a wife.

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Six things to be as a wife or a prospect of a wife,

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 and the first one is actually for the guys, and that will make more sense in a minute.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 The promise of this text, you find this woman, it says, for guys, it says this, verse 23,

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 "Her husband is respected at the city gate where he takes his seat among the elders of the land."

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Ladies, free advice.

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Men want to feel respected.

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 That's universal across the board.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 It's the way God made us.

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 We have this deep desire to feel respected.

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And then for the ladies, it says in verse 28, "Her children arise and call her blessed, her husband also, and he praises her.

281
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Honor her for all that her hands have done, and let her works bring her praise at the city gates."

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Men, women want to be cherished.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 There's a deep desire in them.

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 God placed it there for them to be treated like a princess,

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 for you to love them and cherish them and bless them and honor them and keep them.

287
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And that is the offering of this text, if you can understand it.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But the problem is, guys, we don't know what we're looking for.

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And most people in marriage, and I've done this study, and I've done survey after survey after survey after survey,

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 of tens of thousands of people, most people are looking for a feeling.

291
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I want to meet someone who makes me feel special.

292
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And at the root of that is narcissism, and it's not working out for us as a culture,

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 as people are getting married later, people are getting married less, and marriages aren't lasting.

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And I just want to help you from the Scripture.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 So six qualities to look for.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 I'll start in verse 10.

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 It says this, "A wife of noble character, who can find she is worth far more than rubies?"

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And where it says noble character, it means a capable wife.

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And where it says who can find there, guys, this is really important.

300
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 You're to find her, which means how do you find something?

301
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You have to look for them.

302
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 So some of you think you're playing PlayStation 5, she's going to fall through the roof on your lap

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 because you've got a really healthy prayer life, and that's not how it works.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 You've got to shoot your shot.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 You have to say, "Hey, would you like to go on a date with me?"

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 You can use those words, it removes all the confusion.

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I think you are really interesting.

308
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I've observed you from afar, not in the stalker kind of way.

309
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And I would like to take you on a date.

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And so you can say yes, no, or let me think about it, but there is the proposition.

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 "Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life."

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 It's speaking to her worth and to her value.

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So guys, this first one of the six, this one is yours.

315
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 The rest are for the ladies.

316
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 This one is yours.

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 You shouldn't even start looking for a wife until you view women as priceless.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Until you rightfully understand their value, you should not even begin to look for a wife.

319
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Porn is going to tell you they're worthless.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 They're a sex toy for your pleasure.

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Look at a two-dimensional image and have your way from this buffet or this hub of all kinds of dark desires that are ruining you.

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And it is a worship of Satan.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And I'm begging you to stop.

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 It is amazing. Consider this.

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 What if all the people in here, and women, it's a women problem too.

326
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 What if you walk through those doors in just a minute and you never look at porn again?

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 What if the only pair of breasts you see until you're face-to-face with Jesus are your wives?

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 What if you never even watch a movie again with nudity?

329
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 You take it that -- you can do that.

330
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 It is available to you.

331
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I've done it. I've gotten there.

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I've fought vigilantly.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I've gone from every single day to that, like, gone behind me.

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 When I'm tempted, I confess, I ask for a prayer.

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 If I see something I shouldn't, I'm watching a movie, comes across.

336
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Hey, guys, here's what just happened.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Would you pray for me?

338
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Would you help me?

339
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Guys, it's available to you.

340
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 You can do it.

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 I know you're like, I can't.

342
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I'm struggling.

343
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 How are you struggling?

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 How do you look at porn?

345
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Where's your phone?

346
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Euphoria is not going to help you see her as priceless.

347
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 You taking dating advice from Post Malone, not going to help you see her as priceless.

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Stop it.

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Please.

350
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Please.

351
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 1 Thessalonians 4 says this.

352
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It is God's will that you should be sanctified, that you should avoid sexual immorality,

353
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable,

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God,

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins as we told you and warned you before,

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 for God did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life.

358
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 That is a stern warning from the Scripture.

359
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Holy Spirit, preserve that for you tonight.

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 It's ironic that I would be teaching this to you today.

361
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 I didn't sleep well last night.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I don't feel real well if I'm honest.

363
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I got in a conversation with Monica, that's my wife, we've been married 18 years, right before bed.

364
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And it's been a really busy season, really hectic, a little chaotic.

365
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And she just said this to me, and it really crushed me, honestly.

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 She said, "Hey, I don't feel super valued by you right now."

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And I just thought, really all night, I mean at 3 in the morning I was thinking,

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 "What have I done?"

369
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Like I'm going to tell all of these young adults that their view of women is priceless,

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 and my wife is telling me she doesn't feel valued.

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I've got to change this.

372
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And I asked her forgiveness.

373
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And you guys can pray for us.

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 She would feel that I would make her feel priceless.

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Verse 13, "She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands."

376
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Flax is used to make linen.

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Eager hands means she enjoys her work.

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 "She is like the merchant ships bringing her food from afar."

379
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 She's setting the table for the family.

380
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 It's not hamburger helper, like she's done work.

381
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 "She gets up while it is still night.

382
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 She provides food for her family and portions for her female servants."

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 She's able to assess the needs and meet the needs.

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 "She considers a field and buys it.

385
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Out of her earnings, she plants a vineyard.

386
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 She sets about her work vigorously.

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Her arms are strong for her task."

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 She's got big arms. Put that on the list.

389
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 "She sees that her trading is profitable.

390
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And her lamp does not go out at night.

391
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 In her hands, she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers."

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 That's something you would use to make clothes.

393
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And then verse 24 says, "She makes linen garments and sells them

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and supplies the merchants with sashes."

395
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Girl boss, man.

396
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I mean, truly, she's corporate.

397
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I mean, she's doing stuff right here.

398
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 My second point is she's resourceful.

399
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 You want to look for someone who is resourceful.

400
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I'm not saying that she has more than 3,000 followers and she's super fun.

401
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I'm saying that she can figure out how to feed a family with an empty pantry.

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 She looks at a challenge and she meets it.

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Genesis 2 says you're looking for a helper,

404
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 that God made women to help men.

405
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And women thinks that's really chauvinistic.

406
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I think it's pretty insulting to men because it says we need help.

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And that word "helper," as you are offended, be careful,

408
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 because that word "ezer" in the Hebrew is the same word used to describe the Holy Spirit.

409
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 It's the same word for God.

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 God is our helper.

411
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So it's not an insult at all.

412
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's actually a compliment.

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 You would come alongside somebody

414
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 and you would not complete them but compliment them.

415
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Here's the truth, friends.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Marriage is much more pragmatic than you ever want to admit.

417
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 It's two people partnering together in life because life is hard.

418
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And it's easier when you have a partner that's good at things that you're not good at.

419
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And that's why I say this.

420
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Much of the rest of the list until we get to the last one, they're not necessary.

421
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 If you're like, "Hey, I'm not very good at this," great. Find someone who is.

422
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 So you guys can compliment each other.

423
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 She's solving problems here. She's on it.

424
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 She's a room mom. She's making clothes.

425
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 She's planting. She's cooking. She's trading. She's selling.

426
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I'm not saying that you have to marry Suzy Hallmaker.

427
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 But I am saying you want to audit what am I bringing to the table,

428
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 and I want to make sure that if I don't have it,

429
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 that I find someone with it so that we can compliment each other in this.

430
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 In our marriage, neither of us really like to cook.

431
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And so this is where we find ourselves 18 years in.

432
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I'm no chef, and she's great at a lot of things.

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 [laughter]

434
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 That's just not one of them.

435
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And so we eat out a lot, and we need to go in eyes wide open,

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 understanding this is the lot that we have for ourselves,

437
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 or we need to take some cooking classes, which we haven't done yet.

438
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It says she makes sure the needs of her family are met.

439
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Does she like kids? How do you know?

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Does she serve in children's ministry?

441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Does she want to keep your sister's kids?

442
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Or is she like, "No, I don't really want a family,"

443
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 because sometimes that can be a sign of selfishness.

444
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 "I don't want anyone to put me out."

445
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 No, it's like, "Hey, I don't really want a family because I want to be the best aunt ever."

446
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 That's different.

447
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 "I don't want a family because I want to use our home as a foster house."

448
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Oh, man, that's way different.

449
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 "I don't want my own family because we're just going to create this discipleship hub in the community."

450
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 That's amazing.

451
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 "I don't want my own family because I want to be a dog mom."

452
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 That's different.

453
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Yeah, that's--you know, and so you want to be aware,

454
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 because here you say, "Well, do I have to want kids?"

455
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 You have to view kids as a blessing.

456
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 That's Psalm 127.

457
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Children are a blessing from the Lord.

458
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 That's what the Scripture says.

459
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 If the Scripture is authoritative in your life,

460
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 so much of marriage is about discipleship in the home.

461
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I think we think of marriage like, "Oh, I got someone fun to go to Paris with."

462
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 David.

463
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Just kidding, dude.

464
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Just kidding.

465
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 No, but marriage is so much about discipleship.

466
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And so you want to go in eyes wide open.

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 You want to understand the assignment.

468
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I've got a job.

469
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I've had different jobs, corporate America, worked for AT&T.

470
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I've sold different things along the way.

471
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I've, you know, served with the porch ministry.

472
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I've served in this church, and then I have the privilege of pastoring a church.

473
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Some would say my job is hard, lots of travel, you know, hearing people's problems,

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 those kinds of things.

475
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Here's the deal.

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 My wife, she works in the home as a mom, takes the kids to school.

477
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Right now she just picked one up from a basketball game.

478
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I saw that text right before I walked up.

479
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I don't want to trade her not at all.

480
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Like her job is so much harder than mine.

481
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 In fact, sometimes, like every now and then she'll travel, and I'll have to do her job.

482
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Like I've become this overnight Uber driver, and I'm trying to figure it out.

483
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And I write my letter of resignation before noon, but then I don't have anyone to give it to.

484
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And so it's hard work.

485
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And if you don't like hard work, you're not going to like marriage because it's hard work.

486
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 You're like, well, being single is hard.

487
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Being married is probably harder.

488
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 You're like, well, you don't know.

489
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 You weren't single.

490
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 What?

491
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I wasn't.

492
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I indeed was single as a young adult in Dallas, Texas.

493
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Absolutely, I was.

494
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy, verse 20.

495
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 This shows her compassion.

496
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Number three, she's empathetic.

497
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 She's not bossy with an attitude.

498
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Some guys are like looking for that, which is weird.

499
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Like I want a diva, you know.

500
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Where's the gentle and quiet spirit in that?

501
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 It's a strange day we live in.

502
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I want someone who is super bossy.

503
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 That's weird.

504
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Does she text encouraging things to people when they need it?

505
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Does she write notes?

506
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Does she give to those in need?

507
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Does she serve?

508
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Is she always looking to serve?

509
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 That word serve is really important.

510
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Genesis 24, when Abraham sends Eleazar to find a wife for his son, Eleazar goes to look.

511
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Like this is how they did it in the olden days.

512
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 He's like hey, go find me a wife.

513
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 He's like well, what if there's no chemistry?

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 We'll figure it out.

515
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 He's like hey, go find him a wife.

516
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Goes where all of the people go to serve, the well.

517
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And God says to him, find the one who will get you water, which was hard in that day.

518
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You have to hike all the way down the well, back up, and then give water to your camels.

519
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Find the person who serves.

520
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And some of you are like, oh, that's chauvinistic.

521
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 You're saying that I have to be a servant.

522
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 No, I'm saying Jesus was the chief servant again.

523
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 You get to carry the character traits of God.

524
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And in Ephesians 5, it says the man's job is to sacrifice, that he's to die for you.

525
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So if your husband, future husband ever says, see, the Bible says you're to submit to me, just elbow him back.

526
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 He says, well, the Bible says you're to die.

527
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 My bride's super sensitive to the needs of others.

528
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 It's her superpower.

529
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 She walks into a room, finds the most vulnerable person, moves to them, and meets their needs.

530
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Sometimes it's the elderly.

531
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Sometimes it's a baby.

532
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Sometimes it's a sick person.

533
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 She has no regard, no fear of getting sick herself.

534
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 She will go.

535
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 She will hug them.

536
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 She will love them.

537
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 She will make soup for them.

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Like this is who she is.

539
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 It's amazing to watch her do it.

540
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 One of the biggest challenges, actually, in our marriage, truly, the biggest fights we've had have been because about six years ago, we got a labradoodle for Christmas.

541
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And she cares so much for that dog.

542
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I mean, she wants the water to be a comfortable temperature.

543
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So she'll put ice cubes in it.

544
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Yeah, that's my bride.

545
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And she doesn't want her to be lonely, so she'll leave the TV on.

546
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 You know?

547
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 So, right, this is -- she cares deeply for the comfort of this animal.

548
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And it drives me crazy, but I'm so thankful for that character trait because I see it when our kids are sick all night.

549
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And it costs her nothing to go without sleep, to care for those children, to do whatever it takes to make sure everyone in our home is safe.

550
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Everyone in our home is comfortable.

551
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Verse 21, "When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for all of them are clothed in scarlet.

552
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 She makes coverings for her bed.

553
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 She is clothed in fine linen and purple."

554
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 This is something about aesthetics here because it's talking about she's clothed in scarlet, she covers her bed, she's clothed in fine linen and purple.

555
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 These were, like, really expensive colors.

556
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I would say number four, from the scripture, and it's kind of a strange one, she's tasteful.

557
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 She's tasteful.

558
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I'm not saying, like, she has $600 shoes and lip injections, like, Insta-Filler.

559
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 That's not what I'm talking about.

560
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I'm saying she makes things pretty, which is just a fact.

561
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Guys, when you get married, like, right now, here's the weird thing.

562
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Right now, on your bed, there is one pillow.

563
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Okay?

564
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Maybe, maybe you're one of those dudes, you got two, right?

565
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 On my bed right now, I've got 11 pillows.

566
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 My pillows have pillows.

567
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I've got pillows for pillows, right?

568
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Like, you may have a mat in front of your door.

569
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I've got rugs stacked on top of rugs.

570
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 I've got rugs rugging rugs.

571
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Like, I don't even know what the rug underneath is doing, right?

572
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 But there's just something about the aesthetics that my wife brings to the table.

573
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And so, ladies, you know we need help here, right?

574
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Because you've been in his apartment, and you're like, "Do you mind if I use the restroom?"

575
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And you walk in, and then you walk out.

576
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Because you're like, "What is that science experiment in there?"

577
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You're growing mold.

578
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 And you pull out dishes out of the cabinet, and you're like, "Have you washed these?"

579
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, I wiped them off."

580
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 "No, but in the dishwasher, like hot water."

581
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And he's like, "Oh, is that necessary?"

582
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And so, we need some help in this area.

583
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 But right about now, some of you ladies are like, "Actually, I'm really dirty. Oh, no. He's going to call me out."

584
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 We know you're here.

585
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 [Laughter]

586
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And I would just say, "That's fine."

587
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 But you're probably going to want to find somebody who's clean.

588
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Otherwise, no one's going to come see you guys.

589
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 [Laughter]

590
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Again, not all non-negotiables.

591
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Suggestions.

592
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Things to consider.

593
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 We just built a house.

594
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Everyone walks in our home, the second home we built.

595
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Everyone walks in and says, "Hey, Monica, did you get to pick out all this stuff?"

596
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Here's the truth. I care about that way more than she does.

597
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And so, sometimes it's just different.

598
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And so, the only degree I have is in art.

599
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I care about the aesthetics.

600
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And so, that's okay.

601
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 You can play those different roles in your marriage.

602
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 It's not a sin.

603
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Verse 25.

604
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 "She is clothed with strength and dignity.

605
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 She can laugh at the days to come.

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.

607
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness."

608
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 She's not lazy.

609
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 She doesn't eat the bread of idleness.

610
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 There's this preparedness in this text.

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 She's clothed with strength and dignity.

612
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 There's the days to come.

613
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Number five, she's thoughtful.

614
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Webster's defined these words as giving careful consideration to opportunities.

615
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 She is thoughtful.

616
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 If her primary concern is self-care, right, she might be selfish.

617
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 If she's constantly thinking about the next Manny and Petty over who else she can care for,

618
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 I don't know that she's going to be the best wife for you.

619
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But the problem is, you're like, "But I really like her fingernails shiny."

620
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 And that's cool, all right?

621
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 But you want to give careful consideration to is she thoughtful, right?

622
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And so if you're not prepared, if you're not thoughtful, you're here, you're a woman,

623
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 you're like, "Hey, that's just not my gift.

624
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I'm artsy," you know, that's fine.

625
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 But you're probably going to want to find a guy who is.

626
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Or your bills aren't going to get paid.

627
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And your electricity gets turned off.

628
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And your home gets foreclosed on.

629
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And you're like, "He was right.

630
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I should have found somebody who was thoughtful."

631
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And she needs to plan well, not OCD.

632
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 It's okay if she's spontaneous.

633
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Enneagram 7s can make good wives, right?

634
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Yeah, she's here.

635
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 I'm just saying, and here's the good news, lady.

636
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Let me tell you something crazy.

637
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Let me tell you something crazy.

638
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 I'm an Enneagram 7, by the way.

639
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Yeah, me and you.

640
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And you can grow through this.

641
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Like, it is a learned skill.

642
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Like, the Holy Spirit can produce this in your life.

643
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Like, you can become less self-centered, more others-focused.

644
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 You can even grow in your ability to plan.

645
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Like, I -- this season's been crazy.

646
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 So, in the last five weeks, we've gone to four weddings.

647
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I just got back from Colorado.

648
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 I didn't even unpack the bag.

649
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 I just threw in an extra sweatshirt, turned around, got back in the truck,

650
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 drove up here to Dallas.

651
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 It's just been a whirlwind.

652
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And I'm not the best planner.

653
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I may be the worst on the face of the earth.

654
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And on our island, in our kitchen, is a calendar, an old-school one with, like,

655
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 boxes and numbers.

656
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 And beside the calendar is a thing of markers, six of them.

657
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 They're all different colors.

658
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And my wife does work on that calendar every single night.

659
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 She stands there at the island, and she just starts crossing stuff out and

660
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 stuff, and she's doing calculus over there.

661
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 I don't know what it is.

662
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 But it's greens and blues and purples and oranges, and everything's color-coded.

663
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And she makes sure all the planes land on time.

664
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And, like, she's like, "Hey, don't forget, porch tomorrow.

665
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 You need to be there by this time, you know?

666
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Hey, you're going to stay here, and then you're going to come back."

667
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And this is super helpful to me.

668
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And people are like, "Does your wife work?"

669
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I'm like, "Absolutely, more than I do."

670
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 Absolutely she does.

671
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Verse 30, "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the

672
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Lord is to be praised."

673
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 You guys care so much about chemistry and beauty.

674
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 How does the Scripture value beauty?

675
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 You've got to answer that question in your heart.

676
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 And then maybe say, "Man, what if I'm off?"

677
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Because I know, you understand, I've had these conversations, like, literally

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 hundreds of times.

679
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Like, "Wait, is it not important?

680
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 I don't understand.

681
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Am I supposed to take one for the team?"

682
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 And I would just say, yeah, like, it can be important.

683
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Like, here's an example.

684
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 This is kind of a sermon within a sermon, right?

685
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Think about your hand.

686
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Everybody give me a hand right here.

687
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Just put up a hand.

688
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 This will be helpful to you, okay?

689
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 You're looking for someone to spend the rest of your life with?

690
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Here's some things to consider.

691
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Your thumb, it's an opposable thumb.

692
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 You can't pick something up without it, all right?

693
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 It sits on the other side of these fingers.

694
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 So you want someone complimentary, like someone who compliments you,

695
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 like someone who has gifts where you don't and you have gifts where they don't.

696
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Does that make sense?

697
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Like your thumb.

698
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Okay, your pointer finger, this is like how you give direction.

699
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 You want someone going the same direction as you, all right?

700
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 You're both running hard after Jesus together.

701
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 You're equally yoked, okay?

702
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 This middle finger, this is something you can communicate something with really fast, all right?

703
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Communication is important in marriage, all right?

704
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Communication really matters.

705
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 You want someone that you communicate with.

706
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 This ring finger, this is your finger of commitment, commitment.

707
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 You want someone who's committed to you.

708
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 They're not going to go outside the marriage.

709
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 This pinky, it's attractive.

710
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 You want someone you're attracted to, okay?

711
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Now, pinky is important.

712
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Like I'd rather not go through life without it.

713
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 But, I mean, if I've got to lose a finger, you know, take the pinky, right?

714
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And so there's a place for it.

715
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 It's just not first, second, third, or fourth place, all right?

716
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 And so many of you guys have put it in the first place.

717
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 And it's why the divorce rate's what it is.

718
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 It's why your marriage satisfaction rate is what it is.

719
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Guys, I'm trying to help you guys, okay?

720
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 There's a place for it, but it's just not first, second, third, or fourth place, right?

721
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 The most beautiful girl you know may be a miserable wife.

722
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And the 17th most beautiful girl you know may be the best wife ever.

723
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Pay attention.

724
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Look for her.

725
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Number six, is she yielded to God?

726
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Is she yielded to God, meaning does everything in her life stop as she fears the Lord?

727
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 She's a woman who fears the Lord.

728
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 She is to be praised.

729
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Ladies, you may be feeling beat down right about now.

730
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 And I would just say this one is the only non-negotiable for you.

731
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Actually, if the Holy Spirit comes in your life, he can reduce some of those other things.

732
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 You have to have this one.

733
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 This is the non-negotiable.

734
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Your life has to be yielded to God.

735
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 When I met my wife, neither one of us were following Jesus.

736
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And we were both miserable at these list of things.

737
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Neither of us--we were both self-centered.

738
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 We would have made miserable spouses.

739
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 What happened is I stumbled into this place.

740
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I was at a club in Dallas 20 years ago.

741
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Someone invited me to watermark.

742
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 I sat in the back row, hung over, smelled like smoke from the night before.

743
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And I ended up surrendering my life to Jesus.

744
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Here's what that means.

745
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 I looked at the cross, and I thought, "Oh, that was a payment for my sins."

746
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 He paid for my porn addiction.

747
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 I don't have to suffer in eternity for my porn addiction.

748
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 He paid for my alcoholism.

749
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 I don't have to suffer in eternity for my--

750
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 He paid for my drug use.

751
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 I don't have to suffer--He paid for my materialism.

752
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 That's the gospel.

753
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 And I realized he went in the grave in an event that the whole world acknowledges.

754
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 He showed back up to life.

755
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 And this carpenter born in Bethlehem, lived in Nazareth,

756
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 became the single most polarizing character in the history of history.

757
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Every atheist you know acknowledges him by the date they put on their checks.

758
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 2,022 years ago he was born.

759
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 He reset the calendar.

760
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 And when Monica and I gave our lives to that reality,

761
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 the Holy Spirit, God himself, came and lived within us and began to produce fruit--

762
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.

763
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 And so you understand this is the most important thing.

764
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Are you--and you know if you are or not.

765
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 You know how worldly you are.

766
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 You know what your struggles are.

767
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Are you yielded to God?

768
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 And if you're not, right now can be that moment where you just say,

769
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 "God, I know that you died for my sins.

770
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 I know that you raised from the dead.

771
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 I surrender my life to you right now.

772
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Would you send your Holy Spirit in me to produce these things that I cannot produce on my own?

773
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 I can't leave here and by my bootstraps just produce this by my own grit.

774
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 I need your help, Holy Spirit."

775
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 And he will do it.

776
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 I've seen him do it.

777
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 I know he can do it.

778
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 I did an arranged marriage.

779
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 It's very controversial, evidently.

780
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 I don't know why it was controversial, but I did one.

781
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 I wrote a book on dating.

782
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And as a part of that, I've always been a fan of arranged marriages because they're biblical.

783
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And I just said, "Hey, I'm going to arrange a marriage."

784
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And so that's a true story.

785
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I know some of you are like, "What, is he crazy?"

786
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 No, I really did.

787
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 I'm not joking.

788
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 It's not a joke.

789
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 We had, you know, well over 1,000 applicants.

790
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And we put together a team to go through those applicants.

791
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 And I just want to let you in on how we did it, okay?

792
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 We tried to find the most godly guy and the most godly girl.

793
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 That's all we did.

794
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 We didn't care what they looked like.

795
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 We didn't care what they did.

796
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Like, that was it.

797
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 It was just like who, based on these questions, then we interviewed friends and their families.

798
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 We kind of narrowed it down.

799
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 We tried to find the most godly guy and the most godly girl.

800
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 And we did.

801
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 And I told them to come over.

802
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 They met at my house in my living room.

803
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 They each brought their friends with them, which was really cool.

804
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 And then, you know, she lived in Houston.

805
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 He lived in Del Rio.

806
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 He's in the Air Force.

807
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 There were a lot of things working against them.

808
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 But as they realized the Holy Spirit was at work in their life, they got married.

809
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 True story.

810
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Yeah, it's crazy.

811
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Like, they're happily married right now.

812
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Isn't that awesome?

813
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Yeah.

814
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And so just kind of like what it does is solidify things I've been saying for a really long time.

815
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 What am I, just supposed to marry the most godliest person I know?

816
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Sure.

817
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Yeah, do that.

818
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 You would be so much better off than marrying the hottest person you know.

819
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Okay?

820
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 The richest person you know.

821
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 The smartest person you know.

822
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 You will win every time, 10 for 10, out of any of that other stuff.

823
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Isn't that mind-blowing?

824
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 Wait, hold on.

825
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 What did he say?

826
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 I said, "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting.

827
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."

828
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Because that's what the scripture said.

829
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 I want to redefine what is pretty.

830
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 I want to redefine what is pretty.

831
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Do you see her in summary?

832
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 Do you see her as priceless, guys?

833
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Is she resourceful?

834
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Is she empathetic?

835
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Is she tasteful?

836
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Is she thoughtful?

837
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Is she yielded to God?

838
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Okay?

839
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Can we redefine what is pretty?

840
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 [Applause]

841
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 High school is funny.

842
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 You get to see where people end up.

843
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Kelly, she married a guy who wasn't a Christian.

844
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Kind of followed along through Facebook, you know.

845
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 They struggled in life.

846
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 It's been hard.

847
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 It's been a tough go.

848
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 I think about who I didn't want to be with.

849
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Jennifer was in there.

850
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 I changed her name too.

851
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 She had acne.

852
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 She was a little overweight.

853
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 She was kind of dressed, frumpy clothes, you know.

854
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 She's smart.

855
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 She understood the assignment.

856
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 Whoever partnered with Jennifer won.

857
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 They got an A.

858
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 She passed.

859
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 I think she was salutatorian actually.

860
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 I get to see where she goes in life.

861
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 She found a guy who loves Jesus.

862
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 They got married.

863
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 The Holy Spirit is at work in their life.

864
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Lots of happiness in their home.

865
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Lots of love.

866
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Lots of joy.

867
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Lots of peace.

868
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Lots of patience.

869
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Lots of goodness.

870
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 Lots of faithfulness.

871
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 And lots of self-control.

872
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Gentlemen, I've been saying this for 15 years.

873
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And I'm not going to stop and I'm going to say it again tonight.

874
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Because I've seen it serve people really well.

875
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 It's the truth.

876
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 If you're here and you love Jesus, men.

877
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 If you're doing well.

878
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 You're walking in purity.

879
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 You're praying.

880
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 You're reading the Bible.

881
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 You're in community.

882
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Doing life with other people.

883
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 You're a member of a church.

884
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 You're serving.

885
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 That's you.

886
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 And you desire marriage.

887
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 If you don't desire marriage, no problem.

888
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You can be single for the sake of the kingdom.

889
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 That's amazing.

890
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Amazing.

891
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 And I want you to marry her.

892
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 I'm kidding.

893
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 Don't marry her.

894
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 [Laughter]

895
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 How about we start with asking her out.

896
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 And so here's the words.

897
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 I'm going to give them to you because you'll get nervous.

898
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 You can write them down if you want.

899
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 Will you go on a date with me?

900
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 [Laughter]

901
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Okay.

902
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 And you can even use me if you want.

903
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 I don't mind being that guy.

904
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 You can say, hey, so JP at the porch said I'm supposed to ask you out.

905
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 That's fine.

906
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 You can totally run that game.

907
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 That's all good.

908
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Yeah, so my pastor said that I'm supposed to take you on a date.

909
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 And just see how it goes.

910
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Ladies, for God's sake, man asked you out.

911
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Go to coffee with him.

912
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 If you don't want to go again, that's okay.

913
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Tell him why.

914
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Use words.

915
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Be specific.

916
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 Say, hey, as I'm seeking a husband,

917
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 you're not what I'm looking for.

918
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 But I'm thankful.

919
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 Just honor him.

920
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 Be respectful.

921
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 But you can use words.

922
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 We can be adults.

923
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 It's okay.

924
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 You know?

925
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 And so that's my prayer for you.

926
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 I pray that it would happen.

927
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 I'm not trying to create insecurities.

928
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 Like ladies, we'll leave here.

929
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 Like nobody asked you out.

930
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 You're like, I must not be godly.

931
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 It's not what it means.

932
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 It's not what it means.

933
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 God sees you.

934
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 He hasn't forsaken you.

935
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 He hasn't forgotten you.

936
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 He's with you.

937
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 He's for you.

938
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 He's got you.

939
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Okay?

940
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 Pray.

941
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Don't obsess.

942
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 Continue to work on these things.

943
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Ask the Holy Spirit to work on these things in you.

944
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 And my prayer is it will go well for you.

945
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Let me pray that it would.

946
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Lord, would you just, if nothing else,

947
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 help us to surrender to the truth of who you are

948
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 and what you did for us through your son.

949
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 We love you.

950
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 And we're thankful that you love us.

951
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 And there is an epidemic among us where we obsess with the pretty.

952
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Would you help us to define it, redefine it,

953
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 in a way that honors you?

954
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Thank you for this text that you've preserved that is helpful,

955
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 written not for women but for men,

956
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 to know what the golden standard is of what you would have for us.

957
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 We love you, God.

958
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 We praise you, God.

959
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 We ask this and all things in the name of your son, Jesus.

960
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,060
 you
