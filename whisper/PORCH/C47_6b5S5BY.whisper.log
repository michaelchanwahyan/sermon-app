[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:34.220]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.520]   Hey, welcome everybody in the room,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.200]   everybody joining us
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.640]   from all the different PortsLive locations,
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.680]   PortsIndy, PortsBoise, some of who is here,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.160]   PortsCincinnati, PortsNorthHouston, Tulsa, Austin,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.680]   all the different live locations.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.960]   We're continuing this series, Point of View,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.400]   looking at how they saw the Son of God
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.240]   when He was on this planet.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880]   And let me start with a little bit of a story.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   Around 11 months ago, my wife and I discovered
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.200]   that we were pregnant with our third child.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.040]   And yeah, get excited, thanks for that.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.520]   And shortly after that, a few months go by
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.640]   and we discover that we're having a son.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.200]   So we've got a six-year-old boy now at the time he was five
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.960]   and then a three-year-old daughter
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.600]   and then we're gonna have a son that's gonna be born.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.680]   And we picked out the name
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.040]   and he was gonna go by Bear, Bear Michael Marvin,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   like Bear Bryant or the animal.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.000]   And my daughter was as perplexed,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.360]   both my kids were very perplexed,
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.380]   and like, he's gonna go by Bear.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.680]   So Crew is my son's name and Ro is my daughter's name.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.160]   And my daughter goes, but Dad,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.040]   in her like very list, but Daddy,
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.780]   how are we gonna call him Bear?
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.820]   We already have a bear.
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.660]   And I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.520]   She's talking about her teddy bear.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.840]   She's going, we already have that.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.680]   We're gonna have two bears.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.500]   It's gonna be confusing.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.520]   I'm like, he's gonna start going by Teddy, okay?
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.860]   That's gonna be your new bear's name.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.480]   And my son, we're driving in the car
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.680]   and this conversation's happening
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.760]   and I can see the wheels turning in his head
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.920]   and he's like, he's gonna go by Bear, Bear.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.760]   And he goes, okay, I have a question.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.460]   Let's say one day when he's grown up
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.840]   and we all go on a family bear hunt
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.500]   and we're out in the woods and we see a bear
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.560]   and I say, watch out for that bear.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.600]   And he doesn't know we're talking about a real bear.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.380]   He thinks we're talking about him.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.680]   What are we gonna do then?
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.900]   And I was like, man, because we love bear hunts.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.680]   If we ever go on a bear hunt,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   we will come up with another name that he will go by
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.320]   while we're on the bear hunt so that everything will be okay.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.960]   And he's like, okay, that makes sense.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.320]   And eventually nine months go by
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.000]   and Bear was born January 24th of this year
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.520]   and there he is, just little cutie
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.000]   and everything was great and healthy
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.200]   and he just was amazing.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.120]   And then a week went by and we began to notice
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.160]   that he was having some problems with his eyes,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.320]   specifically his right eye.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.400]   And his right eye began to swell up and began to shut.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.040]   And so we knew something's wrong.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.880]   So we went to the hospital and they told us
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.920]   he has amniotic fluid trapped behind his eye.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.200]   And we thought it was maybe a tear duct
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.840]   or just something, you know, irritated it.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.480]   And they said, no, you don't get that out.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.360]   It could damage his optic nerve
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.020]   and the fluid can even get to his brain,
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.740]   which confused me because I would assume
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.240]   there's more compartments in there
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.440]   that can keep things separated.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.800]   But they said, no, you gotta make sure you get that out
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.920]   or his vision will be impacted.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so for the next seven days,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   every single day we had to go to the hospital
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.720]   and they had to treat him and treat his eye
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.160]   to restore back his vision.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.560]   Now fast forward in today, I mean,
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.520]   here's a picture of him from yesterday
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.920]   where he is just happy as can be, smiles, you can't see it.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.800]   But this is like the greatest stage ever
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.380]   where they're just chunks and they look like
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.560]   they have rubber bands attached all over their arms
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.760]   like Popeye or something 'cause there's just rolls.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.680]   And he's fully healthy.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.320]   And that eye treatment that we went through
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.760]   was significant because they basically said,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:05.960]   hey, if you don't address these,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.920]   it's going to impair his vision for the rest of his life.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.760]   Now what does that have to do
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.480]   with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   Well, in this series, we are attempting to
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   treat the flawed vision that many of us have
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.120]   when it comes to how we view God.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.480]   And we're doing so by looking at the point of view
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.500]   of people who had encounters with Jesus
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.680]   when he was on the planet.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.900]   And so every week we're attempting to go through,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.800]   like my son in the hospital, his treatment
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.480]   to help address and correct the flawed perspectives
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.040]   and visions that a lot of us have when it comes to God.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.640]   Because how you see God is,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.840]   one famous theologian named A.W. Tozer famously said,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.540]   "What comes to mind when you think of God
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.280]   "is what is the most important thing about someone."
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.760]   Because it determines if you run to him
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   or away from him in the midst of failure.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.440]   It determines if you're gonna be willing to trust him
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.320]   and trust his word as it relates to
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.560]   how you should think about life, money, finances,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.040]   dating, love, relationships.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.600]   Are you gonna trust him or not?
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.480]   Our perspective on who God is shapes our future.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.080]   It's currently shaping our lives.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.800]   And so we're attempting to walk through
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.500]   and get a correct perspective on what God is like.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.140]   Because Jesus on the planet
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.620]   is the image of the invisible God.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.560]   So when we look at Jesus, we're looking at God.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.020]   We're able to know what he's actually like.
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.220]   And my heart tonight is that some of us that came in here
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.060]   who think that God is looking at you with disappointment,
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.920]   frustration, apathy,
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.160]   looking to catch you, shame you,
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.200]   will have an encounter and see Jesus in a more clear way.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.240]   And I think some of us are gonna walk away
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.320]   and like the man we're gonna look at, never be the same.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.160]   So we're gonna look at a story in Luke chapter 19.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.280]   It's one of the more famous stories.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.880]   If you grew up in church, you're familiar with it.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.760]   But it's a story of an interaction between Jesus
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.720]   and the wealthiest man in the New Testament.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.840]   And there's a song related to this man
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.040]   and his name was Zacchaeus.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.840]   And Zacchaeus was a?
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.600]   A wee little man, there you go.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.540]   Man, if they were writing that song today,
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.340]   that would be canceled very fast.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.280]   But Zacchaeus was not just a wee little man.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   We're gonna see he was a hated man, and rightfully so.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.900]   And Jesus does some very interesting things.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.040]   And candidly, for those of you who do know the song,
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.360]   my greatest concern is that you're so familiar
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   with the story, you've almost been inoculated
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.760]   or vaccinated from its power.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.480]   Because you're so familiar with it
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.480]   that the radical ways it shocked the audience present,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.940]   it shocked the man who was a part of it,
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.940]   and has shocked the church in history since, maybe lost.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.560]   And so let me pray, and I'm gonna read the text
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.920]   one more time.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.120]   Father, I pray that you would allow us to see
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.520]   what Zacchaeus and those near him saw that day.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.360]   Which is to say, you'd allow us to see you as you are,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.160]   not as we think, not as we're told,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   not as any other thing, but as who you are.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.280]   And you would allow us to walk away, never the same, amen.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.240]   So this starts in Luke chapter 19.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.820]   Jesus is in the last week of his life on earth.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.840]   So he's got very few days left.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.920]   He's headed to Jerusalem to go be crucified.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.960]   And he goes through a town called Jericho,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.800]   and it says this in verse one.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   Now he, Jesus, entered Jericho and was passing through.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.240]   And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:12.240]   He was a chief tax collector and was rich.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.920]   And he was seeking to see Jesus.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.680]   He was seeking to see who Jesus was.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.420]   But on account of the crowd, he could not,
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.040]   because he was small in stature.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.340]   So he ran on ahead and he climbed up
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.940]   into a sycamore tree to see him,
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.900]   for he was about to pass that way.
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.240]   When Jesus came to the place, he looked up,
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   and he said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.440]   for I must stay at your house today.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.780]   So he hurried and he came down and received him joyfully.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.880]   And when they, the crowd, saw it, they grumbled and said,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.440]   he's gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.440]   And Zacchaeus, sometime in the midst of the conversation
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.320]   and meal, experiences a radical change,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.980]   and he stands up and says to the Lord,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.980]   behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.000]   If I have defrauded anyone of anything,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I will restore it fourfold, or four times what I took.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.440]   And Jesus said to him, today salvation has come
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.560]   For the son of man, that's Jesus,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.080]   came to seek and to save the lost.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   I wanna look at three things that we take away
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.120]   from this story, all of them have SOS,
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.580]   so if you take notes, it'll be easy to go along with.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.720]   But first, I wanna talk about what Zacchaeus saw
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.200]   when he saw the Savior, and seeing him correctly,
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.320]   and what that included.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.960]   And so the first idea I wanna pull from the text
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   is seeing the Savior.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.040]   Let me recap what just happened.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.640]   Jesus, he's on his way to Jerusalem,
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.440]   he's got a big crowd that's going around him.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   His fame at this point is widespread.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.920]   Word has traveled out, because a few chapters earlier,
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.000]   or a few weeks before, Jesus raised a man from the dead.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.840]   And the moment you do that, just tip,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.080]   your fame begins to explode everywhere.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.840]   And so he brings the guy back to life,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.520]   and Jesus is now a rock star.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.580]   Everywhere he goes, there's crowds all around him.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.880]   There's one crowd that's here,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.440]   and he's walking through Jericho.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.300]   What do you know about Jericho?
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.760]   Jericho was called by a historian at the time,
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.000]   the fattest city that existed.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.560]   In other words, it was the most prosperous city
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.640]   in all of Palestine.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   It was the wealthiest.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.000]   Today, you can go see all the palm branches.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.560]   It looks like Palm Springs.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.200]   And it was the center of enormous wealth.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.880]   And he walks through, and he encounters a man
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.260]   who is described as being someone of enormous wealth.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.680]   And his name is Zacchaeus.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.640]   And we're told a few things about him.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.200]   One, that he's short in stature.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.320]   We're told that he's rich.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.080]   And we're told he's a chief tax collector.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.060]   Now, what's a chief tax collector?
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.280]   Now, a tax collector,
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.800]   there's really no modern equivalent
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.040]   inside of our society for this,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.600]   but I'll try to describe why it was so hated
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.520]   and why he was so rejected by the people he was around.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.640]   A tax collector had purchased the right
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.860]   from the Roman Empire, which had conquered the known world.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.400]   They basically, as Rome established itself,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.840]   it said, man, we need to get taxes
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.720]   and have people pay us taxes.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.880]   So I know what we'll do.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.920]   We'll get people that live in these areas
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.400]   like Judea or Jerusalem,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.840]   and they can buy the right to say,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.480]   hey, I will give you a million denarii,
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.920]   or I will give you this fixed price
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.080]   so that I can now have the right to go tax these people.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.520]   And I'll give you that amount of money,
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   and I get to add on top of it whatever I want.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.200]   And Rome basically said, that's great.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.480]   And so for Jews, tax collectors were people
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.860]   who had said, I don't believe the Jewish God.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.000]   I don't want anything to do with them,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.760]   and I don't mind enriching myself
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.340]   at the expense of other people.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.100]   I'm gonna finance the oppression of people around me.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.420]   And he wasn't just a tax collector.
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.400]   It says he was a chief tax collector.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.680]   He's a trivia answer to a Bible trivia question.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.240]   There's only one chief tax collector in all of the Bible.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.940]   He's at the head of the pyramid scheme.
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.500]   He's got tax collectors working underneath him.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.920]   And it makes sense why Zacchaeus was such a hated person,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.000]   that he would show up,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.340]   and he had the strength of the Roman centurions
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.340]   and the Roman army with him,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.140]   and he'd say, hey, you need to pay me,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.240]   an additional 50% on top of the taxes you're already paying,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.280]   and if people wouldn't pay up,
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.180]   then he would just take things from them.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.080]   He had the strength of Rome,
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.500]   and the ability to mistreat and abuse people,
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.280]   and he had done so and enriched himself.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.180]   And then he hears about Jesus.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.780]   And he hears of this man who's given sight to the blind.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.440]   He's long, Zacchaeus has walked away from his faith,
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.560]   but he still knows the stories.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.920]   He would have heard as a little Jewish boy
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.180]   of the Messiah, and when he comes,
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.400]   and the miracles he would do,
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.160]   and people were beginning to say he may be the Messiah,
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.800]   and so he's intrigued, and word comes,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.760]   hey, Jesus is on his way into town.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.240]   Zacchaeus decides, I just wanna go see him.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   And he gets to the crowd, and he's too small, we're told.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.760]   It's like Danny DeVito, who I don't even know
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.720]   if you guys know who that is,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.320]   but he's basically unable to see around,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.600]   and so he decides, I know what I'm gonna do.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.440]   There's a tree right there.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.320]   I'm gonna climb up the tree,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.600]   and he climbs up into the tree,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.400]   and Jesus is walking along,
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.760]   and Zacchaeus just wanted to see him,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.180]   and he gets Jesus walking right next to the tree,
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.160]   and he stops, and he looks up,
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.840]   and says, Zacchaeus.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.200]   Now, they've had no interaction before,
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.960]   so Zacchaeus is like, he knows my name?
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.480]   I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.560]   and he says, hurry down.
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.320]   I need to stay at your house today,
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.280]   and Zacchaeus sees his Savior
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.320]   and sees what anyone who knows Jesus understands,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   at least in part, that he is a God who seeks after sinners,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.760]   and seeing our Savior, we see he's a God
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.840]   that seeks after sinful, broken people
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.640]   because that's all the people that there are,
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.320]   and anyone inside of this room
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.280]   who has baggage inside of their past
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.240]   is a perfect candidate or in their present
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.560]   for someone that God wants to seek,
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.040]   and now, whenever we think of Jesus
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   seeking the marginalized,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   it's hard to equate into our mind
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.560]   because part of us goes, man,
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.520]   I just, he's always going after the bad guys
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.320]   and the marginalized and the prostitutes.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.200]   That's just Jesus.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.040]   That's who I love,
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.120]   but if you were in the crowd,
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.960]   you weren't going, I'd love that.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.200]   This is the most hated man around.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.240]   I mean, I was trying to think of an equivalent today
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.440]   of who's the most hated person in society,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.560]   and I could pick some political names on either side
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.560]   that would really quickly expose.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.960]   I mean, the person that if you saw me
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.520]   taking a picture with on the 'gram,
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.320]   the comments are gonna light up of,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.720]   how dare you take a picture with that person,
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.800]   and don't you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.400]   And so I don't know who that is for you,
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.280]   but the person that you would go, that's not right,
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.880]   or don't you know what you're communicating
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.400]   by associating with him is exactly the person,
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.280]   and Zacchaeus sees what maybe some of us have missed,
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.960]   that our God is a God who seeks after sinners,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.920]   and seeing Jesus, we see he's a God who seeks after.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.320]   In other words, there is no one who is an acceptance
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.320]   or exception to having God's acceptance through Christ.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.200]   There is no one who's an exception
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.640]   to having God's acceptance in Christ.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.680]   In other words, the part of you that thinks,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.800]   man, because of the decisions I made last week,
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.940]   or decisions I made last weekend, I can't show up on church,
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.720]   because of the fact that, man,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.280]   I've just been wrestling with pornography for so long,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.600]   God doesn't want anything to do with me,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.700]   or because of the shame I carry from a past abortion,
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.720]   I know God loves me 'cause he loves the world,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.920]   but he doesn't want me.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.000]   Zacchaeus would say, man, you're not seeing the Savior
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.160]   that I saw that day, 'cause he seeks after sinners.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.880]   You don't have to clean yourself up first
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.720]   in order to have a relationship.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.040]   Zacchaeus didn't do anything but climb a tree,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.600]   and he was sought after by God.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.160]   That part of us that feels like we need to clean up,
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.560]   Jesus would say, it's not just untrue,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.760]   it's not possible apart from him.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.280]   Like that tendency, like in my house or with my life,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.600]   there'll be times where we'll host a Christmas party
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.940]   for a community group, or host family over
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.940]   for some holiday, and when that happens,
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.080]   gentlemen, let me just prepare you
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.000]   for what's gonna happen someday
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.880]   when you're married and your wife,
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.720]   she's gonna look at you, and she's gonna go
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.680]   into full clean mode, like we need to shove
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.280]   these things in closets, we need to make it look
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.080]   like no one has ever even lived here.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   We're lighting candles and putting them in bathrooms,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.900]   I don't even know we had these candles before,
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.560]   she's busting out music and playing
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.120]   some new Taylor Swift album softly in the background,
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.220]   and I walk in, she's in an apron baking brownies,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.680]   I'm like, I've never even eaten a brownie bake before.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.200]   She just goes into full,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.940]   we are gonna put our best foot forward,
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.780]   which is ironic because it's often like our family
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.820]   and closest friends, and we're like,
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.460]   we can't let them know what's actually happening here.
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:27.820]   And it's funny, but when it comes to God,
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.300]   that's how a lot of us feel,
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.420]   as though like we could hide things in closets
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.500]   and get them together, and man, if I had enough quiet times,
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.600]   then he's okay with me coming to him,
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.040]   which is crazy, 'cause he knows everything.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.100]   He knows everything you've ever done,
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.980]   everything you ever will do.
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.760]   He knows sins you will commit in 2027
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.520]   that you don't even know about yet.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.980]   And he said it's paid for.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.720]   And whatever perspective you had on God
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   when you came to this room, Zacchaeus would say,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.040]   "You can't leave not knowing he is a God.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.220]   "If you're gonna see our Savior who seeks after sinners,
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.080]   "I can speak from experience."
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:13.620]   And then he does something really interesting.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.360]   We're given a glimpse into Jesus' focus on this man.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.640]   Like Zacchaeus, as I said, he was focused on seeing Jesus.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:27.840]   Jesus was focused on saving Zacchaeus.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.120]   And he walks underneath, and he knows exactly
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.080]   where Zacchaeus is, and he goes to the tree,
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.480]   and he goes to the spot, and he knows who the man is,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.500]   and he says something he says
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.620]   in only one place in the New Testament.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:46.320]   Zacchaeus, hurry down, hurry, come on, hurry.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.760]   In other words, there's no other place in the Bible.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.800]   Jesus is often, he's just not in a hurry.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.500]   And the one encounter that we have where he says,
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.820]   "Man, I am passionate about being with you.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.240]   "Hurry down, I'm not gonna wait.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.080]   "You get down here.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.260]   "I can't wait to be inside of your house."
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.620]   And then he calls him by name.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.720]   You know what's ironic about that?
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.320]   You know what the name Zacchaeus means?
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.640]   This man who had been seen.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.240]   Rabbis taught that if you were a tax collector,
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.280]   you can't go to temple,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.980]   you can't go worship among God's people.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.360]   They taught that if you went into the home
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.440]   of a tax collector or had them in your home,
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.880]   anything that they sat on would become unclean.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.600]   It was taught that rabbis,
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.480]   which is just Jewish teachers of the day, would say,
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.220]   "Hey, it's not a sin to lie to a tax collector
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.920]   "because they're less than human."
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.440]   How long, and he'd been treated this way,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.340]   and he'd only gone further and further.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.240]   I mean, he's not a tax collector who just started.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.920]   He is the chief of the tax collectors.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.200]   10 years, 20 years.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.400]   How long it had been since somebody
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.660]   had even been in his home.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.400]   Sure, he's got the ride, the Lambo, the mansion,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.000]   but it's empty.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.040]   Just like Zacchaeus' heart.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.280]   And the son of God says,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.140]   "Man, I'm in a hurry to be with you.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.220]   "You come down."
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.560]   The name Zacchaeus means innocent or pure.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.840]   His Jewish parents named him right,
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.160]   and at some point he took a turn
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.240]   and became anything but innocent and pure.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.040]   And Jesus says, "I'm about to help you
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.000]   "be what your name means,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.260]   "and I'm gonna call you innocent and pure,
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.480]   "and you come down."
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.880]   And then they go to his house.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.600]   We're told the crowd begins to grumble.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.880]   In verse eight it says,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.480]   "They're having this meal,
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.280]   "and something shifts in Zacchaeus."
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.880]   Maybe it was just the fact that he's sitting
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.360]   and he's looking into the eyes of somebody,
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.200]   and they looked at him in a way that he hadn't felt
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.680]   since maybe like his mom had looked at him
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.020]   or somebody who loved him.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.060]   And he's conversing with them.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.280]   Something shifts, and Zacchaeus begins to go,
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.760]   "Man, I'm leaving everything.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.000]   "I'm changing jobs.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   "I'm giving it away.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.260]   "I'm making wrongs right."
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.560]   Maybe in the midst of the conversation,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.920]   Jesus miraculously brought up things
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.880]   as he does in other places in the New Testament,
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.120]   and Zacchaeus knew this is not a normal man.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.760]   Maybe he brought up names of his siblings
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.800]   or something he experienced when he was a child
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.760]   or some reason that Jesus said,
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.520]   "I remember when you got into tax collecting.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.460]   "I remember the day that you walked away from God
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.200]   "because of the disappointment you faced."
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.120]   We're not even told,
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.120]   but he has some conversation with Jesus,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   and halfway through the lunch, he stands up and says,
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.320]   "Lord, I'm leaving it all,
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.580]   "and I'm gonna give half of my possessions
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.420]   "away to the poor."
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.600]   This is the richest man around.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.640]   This is Elon Musk standing up saying,
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.560]   "I'm not buying Twitter.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.900]   "I'm giving half of the things that I own away,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.500]   "and the other half I'm gonna keep
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.240]   "'cause I'm gonna go and I'm gonna make every wrong
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.420]   "that I've done right,
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.640]   "and I'm gonna show up in people that I've stolen from.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.440]   "I'm not just gonna give 'em back what I've stolen.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.160]   "I'm gonna give 'em four times as much."
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.840]   Imagine the guy who ripped you off,
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.700]   stole $10,000 from you,
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.900]   and he shows up at your door and says,
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.960]   "Man, I met Jesus.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.840]   "Here's $40,000.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.980]   "I'm really sorry."
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.880]   That's exactly what happened
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.560]   because Zacchaeus, in seeing our Savior,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.440]   he also shows us how we see our salvation.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.420]   Jesus says, "Salvation came to this house."
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.300]   In other words, this is not lip service.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.020]   This is a changed man.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.340]   The second point I wanna highlight is seeing our salvation.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.140]   The Bible says that two things are made apart
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.380]   of someone experiencing salvation.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.020]   The first is that they have to see themselves as a sinner.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.160]   In other words, one of the barriers
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.220]   to people becoming a believer,
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.720]   and candidly, some of you guys in the room,
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.820]   is you think that, "Yeah, I'm not perfect,
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.180]   "but if I give enough to charity
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.340]   "and I'm a nice person and I don't commit adultery
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.220]   "or kill anybody and I just try to be good
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.220]   "and follow the way, then I'll get to go to heaven."
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.420]   And that's not true at all.
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.780]   The Bible says you're unable to save yourself,
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.220]   and if you don't see yourself as a sinner,
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.420]   you're never gonna have a need for a Savior,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.860]   that you need a solution that, on your own,
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.900]   you can't provide.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.100]   A couple months ago, we went to Indianapolis,
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.460]   and we were up there, and we were at the porch,
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.460]   Indianapolis, and while we were there,
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.860]   the person who basically invited us
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.420]   and had us come speak, he rented a car for us,
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.620]   and we showed up, and he said,
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.940]   "Hey, man, I got you a Tesla rental car.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.760]   "Just wanted you guys to have fun.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.160]   "And I don't know how you roll,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.380]   "I'm not exactly a Tesla."
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.780]   Man, that's a lot about Elon tonight,
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.420]   but, "I'm not exactly a Tesla person.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   "I've never driven a Tesla."
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.480]   So we get in it, and it's like,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.160]   "Man, I'm not sure exactly how this works,
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.620]   "and I'm looking for the keys, and there's no keys."
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.820]   And I'm like, "Man, there's gotta be,
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.460]   "it's surely, it's around here."
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.020]   And I'm with Josiah, and he's looking for it,
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.620]   and we're trying to find, "How do you do this?"
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.700]   And we're like, "On, on!"
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.820]   Trying to do anything we can to get this car to start,
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.740]   'cause we don't know what we're doing.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.800]   And eventually, I'm like, "Man, we're running late.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.100]   "We are gonna be late."
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.740]   I just pull up YouTube and go, "How do you start a Tesla?"
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.020]   And it turns out, there's a card
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.300]   that you have to put in a very specific thing,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.300]   or location, and that turns on the car.
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.780]   Whatever reason, that's how they describe it.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.060]   That's how you do it.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.540]   Now, that scenario, we could've either sat there
[00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.180]   and been unable to move, and continued to attempt
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.180]   to figure it out on our own, or make the decision,
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.180]   "I'm not gonna arrive at this on my own."
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.020]   And that's the same with eternal life,
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.580]   and knowing Jesus in this life,
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.480]   that it's something you can't arrive at on your own.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.900]   Having a relationship with God,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.820]   and the right to be with Him for eternity,
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.660]   you will never get there on your own.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.500]   And it requires doing what Zacchaeus saw,
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.020]   of, "Man, I see I'm a sinner."
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.940]   And this is where he had an interesting
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.940]   head start on the crowd.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:02.020]   'Cause you remember, the crowd said,
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.380]   "Does he not know?
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.300]   "Do you not know who you're associating yourself
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.500]   "with, a sinner?"
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.900]   And Zacchaeus knew.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.260]   Jesus knew.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.180]   What they didn't know is that
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.900]   he only associates with sinners.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.220]   The only people who've ever lived are sinners.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.940]   And you can't experience salvation,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.220]   and have a need for a Savior,
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.900]   if you don't see yourself as a sinner,
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.740]   and someone broken.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.580]   And if that's the case, if that's how you see,
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:41.060]   you are the perfect candidate for experiencing God's grace.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.500]   The second thing we see about what makes up salvation,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.460]   is that it comes not through a process, but a person.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.420]   Salvation comes through a person, not a process.
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.020]   Jesus said, "Salvation came to this man's house,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.100]   "like I walked in his door."
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.940]   Salvation came in this door.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.540]   Christianity has never taught,
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.340]   salvation is something that you earn,
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.420]   and you must do a bunch of good works,
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   keep the sacraments, and if you do enough,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.860]   and if you don't, then you're gonna lose it.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.380]   Salvation doesn't come through a process.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.580]   It doesn't come through a mantra, it comes through a man.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.780]   Doesn't come through a process, it comes through a person.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.740]   And that person is named Jesus.
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.340]   And when you encounter him, everything begins to change.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.220]   That's the third thing we see,
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.300]   is his salvation impacted his life.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.480]   It led to a life change.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.500]   But it wasn't a life change directed by law.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.540]   That doesn't change.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.940]   This extravagant, over the top,
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.100]   giving fourfold back from what you stole,
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.580]   that's well beyond what the Old Testament even taught.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.140]   If you rob somebody, you gotta pay this.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.340]   It's four times as much.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.260]   It's like, he's just in love.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.500]   He does what you do when you're in love.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.060]   He's going, man, I'm giving it all away.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.060]   He experienced a love that led to a life change.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.820]   And this is why, tell me, guys, you come around,
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.340]   maybe it's your first time here, and you got friends,
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.140]   and they just love the porch, and they talk about it,
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.420]   and it's beginning to impact their life.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.020]   Jesus is beginning to impact their life.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.380]   And you begin to see them change.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.300]   You know why they change?
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.180]   It's not because they come and they lead a,
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.900]   or we read a big list of rules,
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.580]   and you need to stop doing this, and you need to do this,
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.540]   and this, and this, and this, and then God will love you.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.780]   They experience the love of God, and they begin to change.
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.540]   So they begin to know,
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.460]   because of God's acceptance inside of me,
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.260]   it's just doing something in my life.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.500]   And the way I used to date,
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.060]   I just don't date that way anymore.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.380]   In fact, even trying to pick up girls at the bar,
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.780]   I just find myself unable, I'm not as good, I can't do it.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.980]   I'm like, hey, girl, do you, you own a Bible?
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.980]   And you're just experiencing God's love
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.220]   begin to change you.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.020]   Like some of you guys, I've seen it.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.780]   The way you dress, it's beginning to shift,
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.220]   'cause you used to dress and go, man,
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.180]   how, what do I need to wear
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.580]   that's gonna bring the most attention to me?
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.340]   And now you ask, hey, what am I gonna wear
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.220]   that could distract from attention being on God?
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.340]   And it's because, not some law,
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.900]   like the love of God got introduced,
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.380]   and it's beginning to impact your life,
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.300]   'cause that's what leads to lasting life change.
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.000]   And it's what happened with Zacchaeus in this story.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.500]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.020]   Whenever, I mentioned getting married,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.260]   it's like that relationship,
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.820]   and I got married to my wife almost 10 years ago.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.580]   Having that relationship introduced
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.500]   began to produce tremendous change.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.540]   And it began to change how I use my time,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.740]   began to use how I money, what I spend on.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.540]   And so it went from like, man, I'm sleeping on a futon,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.740]   to I'm sleeping on a comforter with 97 pillows.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.060]   I used to be in a flag football league,
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.980]   and now I'm a member at the Arboretum.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.620]   And just life begins to change,
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.980]   and how you spend your time, and what you watch,
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.740]   and used to eat dinners where guys,
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.500]   I know you're in the room, bro, I was one of you.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.460]   Well, you get home, and you're like,
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.100]   man, is it gonna be a Hot Pocket night,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.420]   or just something else, leftovers, or pizza for breakfast?
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.620]   And now you're gonna sit down,
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.860]   and you're gonna have a dinner, and you're gonna talk,
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.180]   and there's gonna be a longer meal.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.980]   And that relationship just brings about change.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.880]   And you know what?
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.500]   When you step into that relationship,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.220]   it's not a change that you resist.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.420]   Because you're in love, it's a change you welcome.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.940]   And that's what we experience in Christ,
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.620]   and that's what Zacchaeus experienced in that moment.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.660]   And then finally, we're introduced
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:19.800]   to the most powerful mission statement Jesus would ever give
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.740]   where in verse 10, Jesus lays out,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.340]   "Here's why I'm here.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.920]   "Here's God's passion.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.620]   "Here is God's focus.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.260]   "Here's what I'm about."
[00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.380]   In other words, companies have mission statements.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.600]   Amazon to provide a place where you can get anything
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.060]   to anyone, anywhere.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.380]   Or Nike to provide athletic wear,
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.000]   whatever the mission statement is,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.340]   that your company has one probably that you work for,
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.940]   and they have a mission statement that shapes
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.620]   what we're about and how we decide and make decisions.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.620]   And Jesus gives us, here's the mission statement of God.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.860]   And it's also the mission statement
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.820]   of anyone who loves Jesus.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.340]   Because when you love Jesus, you love what Jesus loves.
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.060]   And he says this in verse 10.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:14.880]   "For the Son of Man," which is Jesus,
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.060]   "came to seek and to save the lost."
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.980]   Do you guys know why I'm here?
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.860]   Like I'm gonna give sight to the blind,
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.100]   I'm gonna raise somebody from the dead,
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.500]   and I'm gonna do a bunch of miracles.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.440]   But do you know why I'm here?
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.500]   Do you know what moves the heart of God?
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:42.220]   Seeking and saving the lost, every lost person,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.340]   everyone you've ever seen.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.820]   When I talked about the most hated person,
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.020]   whatever comes into your mind,
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.940]   the person that you'd be like,
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.140]   "I can't believe that that person
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.940]   "would associate with him."
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.700]   You know what Jesus' top concern for them is?
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.980]   Seek and save them.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.740]   You know what Jesus' top concern for every person
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.320]   that you work with, regardless of what they claim
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.700]   is their gender orientation or their sexuality,
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.120]   above anything, he wants to seek and save them.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.320]   And people who know Jesus, like Zacchaeus,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.460]   in this moment, steps into a relationship,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.680]   people who love Jesus are gonna love what he loves.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.720]   What does he love?
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.560]   People.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.480]   And he says, "I'm here to seek and to save,"
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.080]   and I'm gonna do a bunch of other things,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.480]   but I'm going to a cross,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.360]   because I'm here to seek and save lost people.
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.920]   And if you're gonna be about what I'm about,
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.760]   you're gonna be about seeking and saving lost people.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.800]   Third idea we see from the text is sharing our savior.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.480]   Another S-O-S, Jesus' mission statement.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.680]   Repeatedly, he would say, "This is why I'm here."
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.300]   And as Christians, it's why we're here.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.820]   Three chapters earlier in the book of Luke,
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.140]   in Luke chapter 15, there's three stories
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.160]   Jesus rattles off.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.440]   And in each of the stories, or the first two,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.200]   he tells us the only time there is a celebration in heaven
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.400]   that takes place when an action happens.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   He says, "There is rejoicing before the angels in heaven
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.720]   "when one person comes to God."
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.820]   Luke chapter 15, verse 10.
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.920]   "Just so I tell you, there is joy before the angels,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.820]   "a rejoicing among the angels of heaven
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.000]   "over one sinner who repents."
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.920]   That means, you know what happened?
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.160]   If you're a Christian, you trusted in Jesus,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.920]   there was an eruption of joy and celebration
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.240]   in heaven for you.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.440]   What somebody celebrates shows you what they value.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.200]   And people celebrate the Cowboys, you know, winning,
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.680]   or the Mavs going on to the playoffs.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.980]   People celebrate those things.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.480]   People throw parades for Super Bowls
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.840]   because they value that victory.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.540]   What somebody celebrates shows what they value.
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.520]   What heaven celebrates shows us what they value.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.920]   What do they value?
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.740]   People.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.960]   Coming to know Jesus.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.420]   Of every story, every background, every history,
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.820]   what does Jesus value?
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.180]   Seeking and saving the lost.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:09.000]   And there's a group of people in the crowd
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.400]   and they're grumbling, and Jesus says,
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.000]   "You don't know what I'm like.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.380]   "As I'm here to save people, broken people,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.000]   "which is the only type of people."
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.600]   Which means that as Christians,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.640]   we have an opportunity to be a part of sharing our faith
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.720]   in your apartment complex,
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.080]   with the people that you work with,
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.640]   with the family that you're a part of,
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.720]   and opening up and looking for occasions
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.800]   to open up and share what you believe,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.900]   where you find hope.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:47.720]   And in doing so, be about what Jesus is about.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.680]   What's interesting is the passage in Luke 19
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.960]   tells us Zacchaeus got saved.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.360]   Salvation came to his house.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.960]   History tells us he spent the rest of his life
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.600]   sharing that salvation.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.800]   In other words, him walking away,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.880]   we're told by the church fathers,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.480]   and basically the men who came right after the disciples,
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.400]   and they record, and they write out Zacchaeus,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.600]   who was the tax collector,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.120]   went on to become the Bishop of Caesarea.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.880]   In other words, in the same area
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.880]   where he was taxing people and taking from them,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.360]   he gave the rest of his life
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.580]   to sharing the gospel with them.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.560]   He became a pastor.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:37.440]   Sharing the Savior that he met that day.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.840]   And as Christians, we've been invited and are called
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.040]   to spend our life being about what Jesus is about
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.400]   and sharing the Savior that we have.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.840]   As I said, people who love Jesus
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.680]   love what he loves, which is people.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.000]   In 1996, I'm about to close.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.940]   In 1996 in Arlington, Texas,
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.760]   which is right in between Dallas and Fort Worth,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.480]   if you're listening.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.080]   It's basically right in our hood.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   There was a little girl whose name was Amber,
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.960]   and she was nine.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.440]   She would be 35 today.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.440]   She was out playing and riding her bike,
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.160]   and a black pickup truck pulled up alongside of her
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.740]   and abducted her.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.200]   And they searched, and they searched.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.520]   It's 1996.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   The widespread use of communication and cell phones
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.780]   that just look very different.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.400]   And this nine-year-old girl, her family,
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.280]   they searched and searched and searched,
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.600]   and they couldn't find her.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.680]   And then eventually they found, tragically,
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.680]   that she had died.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.560]   She'd been killed.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.120]   And her family didn't want anyone
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.620]   to ever go through that again.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.020]   So they came up with something,
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.480]   and they were a part of the creation of something
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.880]   called an Amber Alert.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.240]   Now I bet you've experienced what I've experienced,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.520]   which is an Amber Alert going off.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.600]   You know what's interesting?
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.360]   When that happens, the general reaction for most of us,
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.680]   'cause it kind of all go off at once,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.320]   is grab my phone and turn it off.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.660]   And sometimes I read it, and sometimes I don't.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.240]   You know who always reads it?
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.080]   The parents of somebody looking for their little girl,
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.200]   somebody looking for their little boy.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   In fact, if there was someone in your life
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.360]   who had lost somebody, and you knew that,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.000]   and you knew they were gonna send an Amber Alert out,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.560]   I'm confident you would be passionate and going,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.080]   "Hey, hey, make sure you check your phone.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.920]   "Make sure you know that.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.520]   "Make sure you, if you see that car,
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.360]   "if you see that person, if you see this happening."
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.120]   'Cause someone I know is lost.
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.240]   And we wanna do anything we can to prevent them
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.640]   from being separated from those who love them.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:18.860]   The message of Jesus is that God has placed an Amber Alert
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.200]   on all of humanity.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:24.240]   And he's got a Kyle Alert, and a Kelly Alert,
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.320]   and an Allison Alert, and a John Alert,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.840]   and a Tyler Alert, and a Kevin Alert.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.680]   And he wants humanity to not be separated
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.720]   from the one who loves them.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.400]   And he's invited the church to be a part,
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.960]   just like with a parent who's looking for a child,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.880]   and saying, "Man, hey, there are people
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.660]   "who are far from their Father in heaven.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:47.720]   "And I'm inviting you to be about what I'm about,
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.180]   "which is bringing the message of a God
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.220]   "who's there to seek and save, not rip people off,
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.620]   "not condemn them.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.840]   "Of a God who would give his life for them."
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.760]   And Zacchaeus, he's sitting in the tree,
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.320]   and it begins to all click.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.300]   "Everything I thought about God was wrong.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:08.300]   "Everything I even walked away from was wrong."
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:12.440]   And our God is a God who seeks after sinners.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   He wants to save humanity.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.760]   And now, as someone who knows him,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.520]   I get to be about sharing the message of Jesus.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.760]   S-O-S, that's what Jesus is crying out.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.840]   And S-O-S, in terms of nautical terms,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.000]   is basically a ship saying, "We need help.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.080]   "We need help.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.040]   "We need help."
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.940]   And the message of the Bible is that to anyone
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.140]   who is willing to say to God, "I need help.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.180]   "I need help.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.500]   "I need help.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.020]   "I can't do it on my own,"
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.400]   is a candidate to receive the gift of eternal life
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.640]   because they are receiving.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.600]   Jesus gave his life for them.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.080]   Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.680]   Jesus wanted to save Zacchaeus.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   And Jesus says, "Come down from the tree, Zacchaeus.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.840]   "I wanna be with you now and forever,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.160]   "which is why I'm gonna be placed on a tree, Zacchaeus,
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.660]   "for you and all of hurting, broken humanity."
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.740]   And if you are someone in the room
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.540]   who has never received that free gift,
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.740]   let me be abundantly clear.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.060]   You're sitting in a church on a Tuesday night at 8.25.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.360]   You could be at happy hour.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.580]   You could be watching sports.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.820]   You could be doing a bunch of things.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.980]   You know why you're here?
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.620]   You think it's 'cause some friend invited you
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:21.220]   and you thought you were showing up to a restaurant
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.460]   and voila, here you are.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.420]   It's because God is seeking you
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.620]   and wants a relationship with you.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.500]   He's not holding the things that you've done
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.080]   or will do against you.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.920]   He paid for them.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.040]   And the rest of us, he's invited,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.200]   man, are you gonna be about what I'm about?
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.820]   The passion that a parent feels for their child
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.340]   being separated is the passion and intensity
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.060]   that I feel for humanity.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.980]   Are you gonna give your life
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:56.140]   to what the world says matters?
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.220]   Building your own kingdom,
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:05.020]   focused on making rich people richer and enriching yourself.
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:10.060]   Are you gonna be about what Jesus is about?
[00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.460]   And if you don't know him,
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.820]   let me tell you what he's about,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.820]   you and you knowing him now and forever.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.980]   Let me pray.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.300]   Father, I thank you.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.100]   I thank you that we love because you first loved us.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:38.100]   The generosity of Zacchaeus is as generous
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.740]   as perhaps anyone in the New Testament except you.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.620]   That he gave away half of the things he had
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:53.100]   and you gave away all of the life you had.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.220]   And I pray for anyone hearing my voice now,
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.860]   in the room, online, or some future date,
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:09.300]   you would help them see you are savior
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:15.860]   and cry out in an SOS, I need your help, God.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   I'm a sinner, but in you I have a great savior.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.940]   We worship you now in song.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.540]   Would we worship you their lives
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.540]   for those of us who know you by sharing that savior, amen.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.300]   That's Savior. Amen.
