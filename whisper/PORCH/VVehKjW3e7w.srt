 Sing, I just want to be.

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:39,220
 I just want to be a place for you to dwell.

7
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,180
 A habitation near the Ocuel.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:52,740
 I'll be your sacrifice, a living offering.

9
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,220
 So come and make your home inside of me.

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,200

 It's all that I want.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,660
 Jesus, there's nothing worth more than you.

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,140
 'Cause you're the reward.

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,120

 Sing, I would rather.

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,560
 And I would rather be a servant in your house

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,540
 than build an old kingdom for myself.

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:02:00,020
 I've walked all my days seeking to see your face.

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:07,000
 I'll give my life in your word I've received.

 All of the things I thought I wanted

103
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:15,300
 don't come close to knowing you.

104
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,800
 And now that I'm yours and you are mine,

 Oh, give me Jesus.

192
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,520
 You can have all this world.

193
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,520
 You can have all this world.

194
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
 I don't want.

195
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 I don't want anyone else.

196
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
 Yeah.

197
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520

 You're everything.

201
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
 You're everything to me.

202
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
 Oh.

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 I don't want anyone else.

204
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
 Oh.

205
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,020
 I don't need anyone else.

206
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,520
 Because you are my one.

207
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
 You are.

208
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 You are.

209
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
 Oh.

210
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,020
 You are my one.

211
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,020
 You are my one.

212
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,520
 You are.

213
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,020
 You're everything to me.

214
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,520

 You are my one.

217
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,020
 You are my one.

218
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,020
 No one else but you, Lord.

219
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,520
 No one else but you, Lord.

220
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 Oh, you are my one.

221
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 Oh.

222
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,020
 All of my heart is yours.

223
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,520
 All of my heart is yours.

224
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:21,520
 Give me Jesus.

225
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,020
 Give me Jesus.

226
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:35,520
 Oh, you can have all this world.

227
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,520
 You can have all this world.

228
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 Everything we need is in Jesus.

229
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,520
 Oh, everything we need is in Jesus.

230
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:59,520
 Oh, everything I need is in you.

231
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 I don't have to look to the left or to the right.

232
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,520
 I just gotta lift my eyes into the hills where my hope comes from.

233
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 Yes.

234
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,020
 I give you everything.

235
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 We give you everything.

236
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,520
 Come on, let that be your prayer tonight.

237
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,520
 Just offer your heart to him once again.

238
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,020
 Once again, as if it were the first time, Father, we surrender our hearts to you.

239
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,020
 We surrender everything, our lives, our desires.

240
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:48,020
 Everything we've ever wanted doesn't even come close to the fulfillment we find in you, in fellowship with you.

241
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,020
 Communion with you satisfies everything.

242
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
 It's the fulfillment of who we are.

243
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,520
 It's just to know you, to love you, Lord.

244
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,020
 Tonight, we just once again give you our attention.

245
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:11,020
 Once again, we give you our worship, our focus, our hearts, everything to Jesus.

246
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,020
 [music]

247
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,020
 Lord, I give you my heart.

248
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,020
 I give you my soul.

249
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,020
 I live for you alone.

250
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:39,020
 Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.

251
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,020
 Lord, have your way.

252
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,020
 Sing it again, Lord, I give you.

253
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,020
 Lord, I give you my heart.

254
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,020
 I give you my soul.

255
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:01,020
 I live for you alone.

256
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:10,020
 Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake.

257
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:18,020
 Lord, have your way in me.

258
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:26,020
 Lord, have your way in me.

259
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:36,020
 Lord, have your way in me.

260
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:47,020
 Oh, I've decided that you are my everything.

261
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:54,020
 I have decided that there's only one found worthy.

262
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,020
 Oh, I've decided that you are my everything.

263
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:08,020
 Oh, I've decided that there's only one found worthy.

264
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:15,020
 Oh, I've decided that you are my everything.

265
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:23,020
 Oh, I've decided that there's only one found worthy.

266
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:30,020
 Yes, there's only one found worthy.

267
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
 His name is Jesus.

268
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:37,020
 There's only one found worthy.

269
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,020
 Mm.

270
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:49,020
 And I am an instrument of exaltation.

271
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:56,020
 I was born to live the name above all names.

272
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,020
 And you hear the melody of all creation.

273
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:09,020
 But there's a song of praise that only I can bring.

274
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
 Come on, sing it.

275
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,020
 Sing who else is worthy?

276
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 Who else is worthy?

277
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,020
 There is no one.

278
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,020
 It's only you, Jesus.

279
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,020
 Oh, who else is worthy?

280
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:30,020
 Who else is worthy?

281
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
 In all the world.

282
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,020
 There is no one.

283
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,020
 It's only you, Jesus.

284
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,020
 It's only Jesus.

285
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:49,020
 I've decided that it's only Jesus.

286
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 I've decided.

287
00:21:53,020 --> 00:22:00,020
 'Cause you are the infinite God of the ages.

288
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:07,020
 And yet you chose to make my heart your dwelling place.

289
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,020
 And you healed my brokenness.

290
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,020
 And showed me your glory.

291
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:20,020
 So I have songs of faith that even angels sing.

292
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,020
 Oh, who else is worthy?

293
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,020
 Who else is worthy?

294
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
 Yeah.

295
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 There is no one.

296
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,020
 It's only you, Jesus.

297
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,020

 In all the world.

300
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
 There is no one.

301
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,020
 It's only you, Jesus.

302
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
 Who else, who else?

303
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,020
 And who else is worthy?

304
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,020
 Who else is worthy?

305
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
 It's only Jesus.

306
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,020
 There is no one.

307
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
 It's only you, Jesus.

308
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
 Yes, I believe.

309
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,020
