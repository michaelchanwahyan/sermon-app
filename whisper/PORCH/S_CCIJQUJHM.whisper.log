[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.520]   - I love it.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.780]   Well, welcome friends in the room and in Fort Worth,
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.560]   in Houston, El Paso, Tulsa, the Woodlands, Spring,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.380]   Cedar Rapids, Tokyo, wherever you're tuning in from,
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.260]   we are excited to continue this series, The Remnant.
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.100]   What's The Remnant?
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.200]   It is the people of God.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.520]   It is the ones that God has preserved
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.360]   throughout every time in all of history.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.120]   As I was preparing for this message,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.040]   I was working with kind of a team
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.600]   that helps create the sermon prep stuff.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.920]   And one of the things that came up,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.360]   it'll make sense in a second,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.840]   will give us a good framework for launching
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.800]   into what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.920]   And it was the subject of the number of things
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.380]   that in school you and I were taught
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.420]   that really have no involvement in our life today.
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.260]   Like the number of things
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.680]   that all throughout elementary school
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.240]   and through junior high and high school
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   and the number of different things,
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.000]   if you think back on it, that you'd be like,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520]   "Oh man, yeah, I did learn that.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.600]   "What was that for, huh?"
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.020]   And so we came up with a handful of 'em
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.680]   that if you really, for most of us,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.040]   it's just funny how much time you spend focusing on this
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.080]   and pop quizzes and tests,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.000]   and then it's just kind of,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.080]   it's gone with the wind forever.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.220]   Here's a few of 'em.
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.600]   Long division.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.400]   Most of us, does anyone use long division
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.780]   on a regular basis?
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.920]   It's like, and if you do,
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.280]   we gotta get you a calculator, friend.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.520]   A protractor and a compass.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.140]   You remember this thing?
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.640]   What sort of space age weird, just,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   I mean, I know engineers in the room are like,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.820]   "Actually, I use one every day.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.900]   "I've got one right here if anyone needs it actually."
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.280]   But for most of us, it's like,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.340]   "Man, this thing that was, you know,
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.540]   "I'm not even sure I ever learned how to properly use it,
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.820]   "but this thing was a part of our life
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.620]   "that no longer, just for a season."
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.420]   How about cursive?
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.540]   Remember cursive?
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.100]   I think, someone told me they stopped
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920]   teaching cursive in school.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.780]   I mean, it's just, it's this thing that,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.780]   aside from a signature, really, you don't use.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.620]   Or in other words, most of us don't.
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.440]   In other words, it's always a little weird
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.380]   when you meet someone who still writes in cursive,
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.020]   and you're like, and they're under the age of 60,
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.860]   and you're like,
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.420]   is that for real right there?
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.900]   It's just, it's one of those things that you were taught.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.140]   Here's another one, dissecting a frog.
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.460]   Yeah, who remembers that?
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.380]   Why did they have us dissect a frog?
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.460]   How about the recorder?
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.180]   Who remembers the recorder?
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.060]   Was this an instrument that was made
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.920]   just for elementary school kids?
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.180]   It's like, we can't give them a real instrument,
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.940]   just give them this.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.740]   Like, I'm not even sure that that's,
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.660]   it's an official instrument, isn't it?
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.780]   It's just kind of like a starter tool that you use.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.820]   I don't even know, honestly.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.100]   So if you teach music, help us remove that.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.780]   The periodic table.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.060]   Remember memorizing this?
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060]   And how relevant is that to your life right now?
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.400]   Boron, it's pretty much the only one I remember, potassium.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.260]   Latin, maybe you went to a school
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.700]   where you were taught Latin.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.540]   Just a bunch of things that, man,
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.020]   you know, you study, you take the quiz,
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.640]   and then it just kind of disappears.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.420]   Ironically, here's the irony in all of that,
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.300]   of all the different things that you would need in life,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.180]   you would think there'd be a little bit more incorporation
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.120]   of some of the things that like,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.860]   when you get out in the real world, you're like,
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.680]   man, how come no one ever taught me this?
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.660]   Like, here would have been some better things, I think.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.180]   How to do your taxes.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.760]   How to do a budget.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.700]   Like, you know, it's sick.
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.060]   Man, there's a lot of people excited about that.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.940]   How to change the oil in your car,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.860]   or even the fact that you need to change the oil
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.700]   in your car.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.980]   How to do car registration, utilities, insurance,
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.260]   household repairs, like just kind of general
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.260]   household repairs, stress management, first aid or CPR.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.180]   I mean, how much better would that be in PE
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.540]   than like, hey, climb this rope,
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.260]   learn how to do first aid or CPR of use of your time,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.020]   better life skill, interview skills,
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.260]   or negotiation skills, stress management.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.680]   And then lastly, conflict resolution.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.260]   Of all the different things that you could have been taught,
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.100]   so many of those have been so much more valuable.
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.180]   And tonight we are talking about one of them
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.380]   that was not taught in the school that I know of,
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.380]   it certainly wasn't a part of my education experience,
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.420]   and that is conflict resolution.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.100]   In other words, it wasn't a course when I went to college,
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.220]   or even when I went to grad school,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.500]   there was no official kind of,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.100]   hey, welcome, this is conflict 101 and how you resolve it.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.580]   And yet, of all of those skills,
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.860]   more important than any other one,
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.980]   will conflict resolution determine your ability
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.700]   to experience joy, happiness in life,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.660]   your ability to have relationships,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.140]   which is a crucial part, everyone would say,
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.420]   regardless of what you believe,
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.700]   of having a life that has meaning and value
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.520]   and just happiness in general,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.180]   that you can't have those without the ability
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.420]   to work through and resolve conflict.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.460]   And yet, no one ever teaches it.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.140]   And maybe you grew up in a home
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.020]   where it was taught you're the rare exception.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.700]   For most of us, if we were taught anything
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.940]   about conflict resolution,
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.180]   it was really just by example and not a great example.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.820]   We learn that dad can escalate a little too quick
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.440]   and mom can withdraw or be passive aggressive,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.500]   or we learn kind of bad expressions
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.100]   of what it looks like to resolve conflict.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.620]   And yet, of everything on that list
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.900]   and of so many different arenas,
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.300]   how crucial if you and I are gonna experience a life
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.560]   that is not just filled with superficial relationships,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.380]   if you and I are gonna experience a life
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.380]   that's not filled with an unhealthy or unhappy marriage,
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.020]   if you and I are not gonna just burn bridges
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.340]   in every direction, we have got to have
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.500]   the skill of conflict resolution.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.460]   And so tonight, we are gonna look
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.100]   at what God's Word says about the topic
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.020]   of conflict resolution.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.700]   And what we're gonna discover
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.260]   and why we're covering this in this series
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.620]   is that the remnant is a people who resolve conflict.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.580]   Jesus says this over and over and over again.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.940]   He says, "My people are gonna be peacemakers.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.080]   "My people are gonna be the ones
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.060]   "who bring conflict resolution about
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.500]   "in their relationships, in the places they live and work,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.260]   "and where they do life."
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.680]   And yet, so few of us have ever really been taught it.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.220]   So tonight, we are gonna explore the subject line
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.060]   of the remnant is a people who resolve conflict.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.980]   The remnant is a people who resolve conflict.
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.820]   Here's what I know.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.180]   If you will incorporate the stuff
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.300]   that we're about to talk about,
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.300]   regardless of what you believe,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.560]   regardless of where you kind of are
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.060]   on the spiritual spectrum, your life will be better.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.340]   You can leave, wake up tomorrow,
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.740]   incorporate the stuff that Jesus
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.380]   and really the Bible teaches in general,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.540]   and you're gonna experience better relationships,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.840]   you're gonna have more peace,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.660]   you're gonna have less conflict.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.620]   And so we're gonna dive in.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.860]   This will be really kind of topical,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.340]   which means we'll jump primarily in Matthew chapter five
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.220]   and Matthew 18 and a few other places,
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.160]   but we're gonna explore the teachings of Scripture
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.300]   as it relates to how you and I can be people
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.100]   who resolve the conflicts in our life.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.660]   So we're gonna kick off the first idea
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.260]   and just explore three essentials for you and I
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.300]   if we're gonna be people who resolve our conflict.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.880]   Three essentials for you and I to have in our life,
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.500]   three components of the skill of resolving conflict.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.240]   The first one we're gonna pull
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.780]   from Matthew chapter five, verse nine.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.420]   Jesus, like three sentences in to his ministry
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.740]   in something called the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.900]   which is just his first kind of sermon
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.220]   that he launches into,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.920]   he begins to talk about the idea of bringing peace
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.180]   and how his people bring peace.
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.380]   Here's what he says, verse nine.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.500]   Blessed are the peacemakers,
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.460]   for they will be called children of God.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.940]   Blessed are the peacemakers.
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.240]   Jesus says that there is a relationship
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.380]   between you being a child of God
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.100]   and your ability to make peace.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.580]   In other words, that just like parents
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.780]   have different attributes
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.460]   that show up inside of their children,
[00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.020]   God is a heavenly father who has attributes
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.160]   that show up inside of his children,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.580]   and one of the attributes that shows up
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.120]   inside of his children is the ability to make peace.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.960]   And for you and I to know that every single conflict
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.440]   is an opportunity for us to bring about peace
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.320]   will require the first essential
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.800]   to the skill of resolving conflict
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.640]   is that we have to have a change in perspective,
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.720]   or a perspective change on the idea of conflict.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.200]   Because conflict, I think a lot of us came in the room,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.400]   and it's not our favorite subject to talk about.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.120]   It's probably not our favorite thing to be a part of.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.740]   We're not looking for more conflict in life.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.080]   That's really what I'm looking for.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.500]   Most of us didn't come in with that,
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.280]   and often we see it as something that is a bad thing,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.720]   that man, every time there's conflict,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.920]   that's really bad, right?
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.400]   Wrong.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.800]   The Bible says you and I need to have a perspective change
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.240]   every time there's conflict.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.160]   We need to have the perspective
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.840]   that we have a great opportunity
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.120]   to show the world who our heavenly father is,
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.220]   to show the world whose children we are, if you will,
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.880]   that our first point from tonight, from the text,
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.120]   is a perspective to change,
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.020]   and if you and I are going to be people
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.080]   who bring about peace, who resolve conflict,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.640]   we have to be people who have a change in perspective.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.600]   Conflict is not a bad thing,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.200]   and it is an opportunity, if handled well,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.120]   to show the world who our heavenly father is,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.320]   or to honor our God, to strengthen relationships,
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.160]   and to grow ourself in general,
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.880]   and Jesus says, man, you will see the children of God
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.160]   will have this quality from their parents.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.120]   My wife is due to have a baby on Friday,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.480]   and yeah, I know, buckle up.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.080]   You can pray for that, and for us,
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.360]   'cause we're about to not sleep,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.920]   and one of the things that,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.960]   like when you're about to have a baby,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.480]   you begin to think through, and your mind can drift to,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.360]   is like, oh, what kind of attributes are they gonna have,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.400]   and what are they gonna look like?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.560]   Here's what we pretty much know they're gonna look like.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.840]   They're gonna have some attributes,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.860]   either from their mother or father, from both,
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.080]   and they're gonna incorporate,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.400]   I mean, it just kind of goes without saying,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.780]   I know it's mind-blowing stuff,
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.640]   that they're gonna have attributes from their parents,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.200]   or a child will have attributes from their parents.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.440]   That's Jesus's point, that the children of God
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.280]   are gonna be people who bring about peace
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.120]   in their relationships.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.880]   So you, someone who brings about peace,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.600]   who moves in the direction of peace
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.400]   when there's conflict in your relationships,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.480]   because Jesus says that is a quality
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.080]   that will mark his people.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.880]   Not only is conflict a great opportunity,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.100]   'cause it will honor God,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.880]   or show who your heavenly father is,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.760]   I mean, we've all experienced that conflict,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.440]   when resolved well, strengthens relationships.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.600]   That's an opportunity to strengthen your relationship.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.400]   In other words, it doesn't have to drive you apart,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   it can drive you and make you stronger together.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.920]   In fact, here's what's crazy.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.680]   Even psychology, or people, non-Christians would say,
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.120]   that the ideal relationship,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.840]   if you are the type of person in the room
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.040]   looking for the ideal dating relationship,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.240]   this is for you, which is a lot of us.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.120]   The ideal dating relationship,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.360]   people often think has no conflict.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.400]   And study after study says, man, conflict,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.080]   if you have a relationship that has zero conflict,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.520]   you are in trouble, because it's a sign of unhealth.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.480]   In other words, if there's absence of conflict,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.400]   generally, they would say, it either points
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.040]   to a codependency, or something really unhealthy,
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   where one partner feels like they can't reject,
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.440]   or can't disagree at any point,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.740]   or it points to a narcissist being involved,
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.800]   who only wants to be around people who get along with them.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.760]   I mean, it kinda makes sense.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.800]   I mean, if you only want to be around people
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.520]   who agree with you every time,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.320]   it's really hard to respect someone
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.880]   who never disagrees with you.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   Think about that.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:31.960]   Like, in other words, you'd be like, yeah,
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.320]   I just want someone who agrees with everything that I think.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.680]   It's really hard to respect someone who just,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.240]   they have nothing to offer you in life.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.360]   They're like, whatever you say, that is our world.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.560]   That's not someone who's like, man, I really respect you.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.640]   And in a healthy relationship,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.080]   there's respect for one another.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.520]   So conflict is not a bad thing,
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   or the absence of conflict is not necessarily a good thing.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.440]   The presence of conflict resolution is a great thing.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.300]   That if you wanna have a healthy relationship,
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.360]   it won't be just, man, I'm concerned,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.140]   'cause we've had a few conflicts.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.040]   It is not conflict alone that determines
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.000]   or whether it's a bad relationship.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.840]   It is the ability to resolve conflict
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.480]   that will serve you in a dating relationship,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.320]   in a marriage someday,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.200]   because, man, you are going to have conflict.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.280]   The skill of conflict resolution is like,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   man, a daily thing, 'cause we only fight in my house
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.920]   like once a day, but it's a crucial one,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.800]   maybe twice sometimes.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.560]   And resolving conflict is a crucial skill
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.840]   that you are gonna learn now,
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   or you are gonna painfully learn
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.920]   through the school of hard knocks
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.460]   and wanna revisit this message at a later day.
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.880]   And so inside of your dating relationships,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.920]   the ability to resolve and to move towards peace.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.520]   And so we're gonna explore a little bit
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.720]   of the steps that are involved
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.320]   for you and I to be a part of that.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.240]   Jesus, the last thing about conflict
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.600]   and the perspective we're to have
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.760]   is it is a big deal, he says.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.320]   In Matthew chapter five, we're not gonna read this,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.640]   but chapter five, verse 23 and 24, you can read it later.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.080]   He essentially says, look, I want you to prioritize
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.280]   working through your conflicts,
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.160]   working through the problems in your relationships
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.760]   above even worshiping me.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.840]   And so if you're in church,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.500]   or you find yourself at a place where you're like,
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.660]   oh man, I'm focused on going to the service,
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.400]   and you realize you have a problem
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.760]   or you're in conflict with a brother or a sister,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   I want you to get up and I want you to leave
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.720]   and I want you to move in that direction.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.440]   Some of you, the best thing you can do tonight
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.760]   is go to make a phone call,
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.040]   there's someone that you need to reach out to
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.740]   to begin to take the steps towards resolving the conflict.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.580]   So that's the first thing,
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.460]   you and I have to have the perspective of man,
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.600]   conflict is not a bad thing,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.240]   but it is a great opportunity
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.840]   to show the world who's our heavenly father
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.160]   or to honor our heavenly father.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.740]   The second part of you and I experiencing the ability
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.740]   to resolve conflict inside of our life is this,
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.200]   that you and I have to know that in every conflict,
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.040]   you have a part to own.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.040]   In every conflict, every single conflict
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.400]   you've ever been a part of,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.720]   you have a role or you have played a part
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.080]   and you have a part that you need to own
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.740]   in the conversation where you need to ask for forgiveness,
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.180]   you need to call it what it is
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.340]   and own what you've done, own your fault.
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.580]   Jesus says this in Matthew chapter seven,
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.760]   verses three through five.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:16.380]   Why do you look at the speck of dust in your brother's eye
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.320]   and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.740]   How can you say to your brother,
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.700]   let me take that speck out of your eye
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.640]   when all the time there's a plank in your own eye,
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.540]   you hypocrite?
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.220]   First take the plank out of your own eye
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.280]   and then you will see clearly to remove the speck
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.320]   from your brother's eye.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.800]   Gosh, I love it, you gotta love Jesus.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   He uses this like exaggerated scenario
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.200]   where he's like, look, you need to be someone
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.840]   who focuses on owning first your own faults,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.320]   your own stuff, your own role in whatever conflict
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.240]   or whatever issues or disagreements that you've had
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.120]   and he uses an exaggerated situation
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.300]   where it's like there's a guy who has a plank,
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.720]   a two by four just sticking out of his eye,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.600]   going around being like, hey, look, excuse me,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.720]   I think I see something in your eye over there.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.580]   I've got my tweezers out and Jesus would say,
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.000]   look, that's absurd.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.020]   And his point is not that you should never be someone
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.860]   who reaches out and helps people see
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.700]   the speck in their eye,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.420]   his point is that you need to prioritize
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.580]   and I need to prioritize owning my fault,
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.580]   owning my part in whatever disagreement first.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.320]   In other words, before I'm gonna deal any with you,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.900]   I wanna make sure that I'm someone who says,
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.620]   man, I need to own my own part here.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.740]   This is, I think, the hardest part of resolving conflict
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.520]   because usually, like we can't really tell
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.600]   that we have a plank sticking out of our eye
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   and we're just prone to think like,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.280]   yeah, the biggest problem is because of her
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.140]   and if she would have just called him
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.420]   or she would have done X or he would have done X,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.000]   then none of this would have happened anymore
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.920]   and we think that inside of our conflict,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.340]   it's hard for me to see what my role was.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.160]   Being awesome, is that what I need to apologize for?
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.360]   I'm being too nice, I'm just too much of a hard worker,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.080]   I expect too much of people, what should I,
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.840]   and we don't sit there and thoughtfully say,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.760]   man, what can I own?
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.520]   How can I see this from the other person's perspective?
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.860]   How can I be someone who owns the ways
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.120]   that I could have communicated better,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.320]   the ways that maybe my tone or the words that I use
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.240]   could have been better,
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.200]   the timing that I had could have been better?
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.120]   What are the things that I can sit down and I'm gonna own?
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.780]   I just wanna start with this.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.600]   I wanna own that the way that I told you,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.080]   or the way that I spoke to you in that moment
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.920]   could have been better.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.200]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.400]   And Jesus would say, whatever you can,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.600]   own in those different situations.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.000]   And so, I'm gonna go one step further
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.680]   and incorporate a tool that we use around here
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.400]   in some other ministries that can help you identify
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.960]   some of the different tendencies that all of us have
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.800]   when it relates to conflict.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.680]   Some of the different bad patterns that most of us get into
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.000]   are our default is, because oftentimes,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.880]   it's kind of our default that will lead us,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.440]   usually in a step towards discovering in the conflict
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.160]   what my role is, and it's something called weenie,
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.520]   that all of us need to know our weenie.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.440]   What is a weenie?
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.160]   A weenie is the four negative types of conflict resolution
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.440]   or conflict patterns that people have
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.760]   that usually, by and large,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.280]   people fit into one of these categories,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.480]   W being withdrawal, E being escalate,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.560]   N being negative interpretation, I being invalidate.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.280]   Withdrawal, do I withdraw, do I escalate?
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.600]   What is my conflict pattern?
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.280]   Because generally speaking, it's one of these
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.180]   that's kind of a part of how I acted in a way
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.760]   that man, was not God's best, and I need to own my part.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.960]   Do I withdraw, do I escalate?
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.360]   Am I a negative interpreter, am I invalidator?
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.760]   Maybe I'm all of the above.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.000]   For me, I am an escalator and an invalidator,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.080]   and so I'm the type of person who almost,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.600]   I kind of have something in part of me
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.240]   that likes conflict, or it's weird, it's like a debate,
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.720]   and I'm like, yeah, let's do this.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   Here's what I think is wrong with you,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.640]   and get the PowerPoint back up there.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.640]   And I can just escalate and cause a lot of harm
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.000]   inside of my marriage, and I'm married to a withdrawer,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.200]   which is an awesome recipe, 'cause it's like,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.840]   get back here! (laughs)
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.920]   That's so bad.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.480]   We're working on it, guys, we're in community,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.720]   and Jesus is taking ground.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.000]   But those are our tendencies, so me,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   or even with our team, my tendency can be
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.320]   to invalidate, and to further invalidate
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.000]   when someone comes and expresses like,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.080]   hey, it hurt me when you said that.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.960]   And I'm like, well, here's why you shouldn't have been hurt,
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.560]   and give 18 reasons why, yeah, this is your problem, okay?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.680]   Let's pray for you.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.120]   (congregation laughs)
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.760]   And it's wrong, and it is, to whatever degree
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.640]   I allow it to continue, or I allow it to happen,
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.560]   it's hurting my relationships.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.320]   And so inside of the conflicts that you have,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.240]   you have a part to own, you probably have a style,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.960]   or some ways that you are dysfunctional
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.120]   in the ways that you conflict.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.760]   Are you a withdrawer, an escalator,
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.000]   a negative interpreter, or an invalidator?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.440]   The third step, so that's our second,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.840]   you and I have a perspective to have,
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.600]   which is that conflict's an opportunity, it's not bad.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.480]   You and I have a part to own.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.640]   I have to own 100% of my 2%, even if it's just 2%.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.560]   98% of the conflict is their fault.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.240]   Like, yes, I forgot the birthday cake,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.760]   they forgot the birthday.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.760]   And I have to own all of my 2%, all of my 1%.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.640]   Whatever part I have in the conflict,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.560]   I wanna own 100% of that, and I wanna lead out with that.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.320]   And then, finally, the scriptures lay out,
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.520]   or we're gonna spend more of our time here,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.900]   a path to pursue peace.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   The Bible really makes it as clear as any of the other
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.480]   skills that maybe we talk about
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.120]   inside of this series on the remnant.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   There is a path Jesus gives, kinda like,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.160]   here's your four steps towards resolving conflict
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.840]   with one another, with believers inside of it.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.880]   And so before we go there,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.640]   I'm gonna give you the other thing the scripture says
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.920]   as it relates to resolving conflict,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.960]   that you and I are to be people
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.000]   who seek to overlook conflict whenever we can.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.120]   That, in other words, the scripture says this
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.480]   in Proverbs 19, 11, that how do I know if this is,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.120]   in other words, let me say this.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.820]   Am I to be someone who every time I either get hurt
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.900]   or I feel misunderstood, or every time something
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.980]   doesn't go how I think it should,
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.080]   I'm to pursue that recklessly as though it's a conflict?
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.160]   Or every time maybe someone said something
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.200]   that impacted me, should I pursue that as a conflict?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.700]   No, not necessarily.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.960]   The Bible says in Proverbs 19, verse 11,
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.880]   that a person's wisdom yields patience,
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.160]   and it is to one's glory, or it is a glorious thing
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.300]   to overlook an offense.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.900]   The Bible says that you and I are to overlook offenses
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.820]   whenever we can.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.400]   The truth of the matter, though, is,
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   and so we'll talk about what does it mean
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.240]   to overlook an offense, and how do I know whenever I can,
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.000]   is a lot of us, I think if we were honest,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   we try to overlook offenses, we try to,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.680]   someone says something mean, and they kinda make a joke
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.440]   at us, and they're like, ha ha, man,
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.800]   that really hurt me right there.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.280]   I'm not upset, I'm fine, okay, it's great.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.680]   I hate this person, and that's how we walk away.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   And we tell ourself, it's not that big of a deal,
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.640]   I'm just gonna go tell all these other people about you
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.480]   and how mean you are, and that's what we do,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.760]   and that's not resolving the conflict,
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.520]   and it's not looking the other way.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:34.180]   The Bible says that you and I, when we can,
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.620]   should overlook it.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.160]   How do we know if we can?
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.560]   If you find yourself replaying a conversation
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.600]   with someone over and over and over again,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.440]   it's probably an indicator that you need
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.640]   to have a conversation with them.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.180]   In other words, if someone does an action,
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.480]   does something that hurts you, says something
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   that either you felt was an inaccurate representation
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.800]   of you, or undermined you, or hurt your feelings,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.480]   and you find yourself kinda driving down the road,
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.920]   replaying the tape, and thinking through
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.280]   what you should've said, and how next time
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.600]   you're going to, and everyone's gonna point at them
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.640]   and laugh, and you find yourself replaying that,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.200]   or you find yourself in the shower,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.880]   just dominating these hypothetical conversations
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   in your mind, you probably need to move
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.880]   towards that person, to have a conversation.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.740]   If you find yourself, and this is a really common one,
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.800]   where anytime you're around them,
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.680]   the only thing you can think about
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.640]   is whatever incident was there.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.440]   You're just like, yeah, uh-huh, that's great,
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.920]   yeah, of course, you need a ride too, well, great, yeah.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.560]   How about you get some friends first, huh?
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.800]   Because you told me I didn't have any friends,
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.440]   and I'm not your friend, and all you can think about
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.620]   is that, and you're not saying it,
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.440]   but it's just kinda like, uh-huh.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.280]   You need to have the conversation,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.000]   or anytime that someone brings up their name,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.360]   you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I used to like him too,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.160]   until I started liking great people,
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.720]   and then I stopped liking them.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.940]   And so, you need to have the conversation.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.920]   So now, that we've realized that we need
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.600]   to have the conversation, if we find ourselves
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.480]   just replaying the tape, how do we have that conversation?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.400]   What does it look like to go through, biblically,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.160]   the process of having that conversation?
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.200]   With a believer, Jesus makes it really clear.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.080]   We're gonna come back to, and by believer,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.160]   I mean a follower of Jesus.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.520]   Here's what Jesus says, are the four steps,
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.360]   according to Jesus, in which you and I
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.040]   are people who bring about peace.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.720]   We're not peace fakers, we are peacemakers.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.200]   And we bring about peace by following Jesus' instructions.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.500]   He says this in Matthew chapter 18, verse 15.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:43.280]   If your brother or sister sins,
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.520]   whether that's against you, whether it's just in general,
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.280]   he's given instructions for the church,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.360]   but if they've sinned, and they sinned against you,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.560]   they hurt you, or a word was said,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.520]   go to them and point out their fault,
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.640]   just between the two of you.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.560]   Dude, how would the church change if just this verse
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.240]   was embraced and adopted and played out
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.460]   all over our country?
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.560]   That whenever someone hurts me,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.920]   I'm going to go directly to them.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.860]   If they listen to you, you have won them over.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.960]   So Jesus says, whenever you find yourself
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.680]   in a situation where someone's hurt you,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.920]   where someone is in sin, or someone has sinned against you,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.360]   that you and I are to be people who go to them.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.720]   We talk to them, not about them.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.480]   I only talk to people who are either a part of the problem
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.000]   or a part of the solution.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.720]   I don't vent, I don't look for things to share
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.440]   and kinda let me just bounce stuff off of you
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.960]   to justify how I feel in this moment.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.840]   I go directly to that person.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.640]   I share directly with them in private,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.960]   for the hopes not of hurting them or wounding them back,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.080]   for the hopes of winning them back, Jesus says,
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.760]   that the body of Christ, and this is a big problem,
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.800]   honestly, there are a lot of you in the room
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.300]   who are talking about people,
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.960]   and you're not talking to people, and it's disgusting,
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.520]   and it's an offense to God.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:16.480]   If you ever find yourself talking negatively
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.320]   about someone who is not present, you are in sin,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.440]   and you need to stop, and you need to repent,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.000]   and you need to ask for the forgiveness
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.040]   from the person who you negatively talked about
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.700]   and the person who you negatively talked to
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.160]   about the other person.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.520]   You need to say, hey, I need to ask for your forgiveness
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.540]   because I was talking badly about Bill,
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.220]   or Mshirt, fill in the blank, whatever their name is,
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.880]   and I've tainted your perspective on him,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.640]   and now I wanna go with Bill, and I just wanna say,
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.840]   hey, I was talking negatively about you to X person.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.460]   If you were to come to me and you,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.520]   I wanted to share something about JP,
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.320]   and how I can't believe it, he's just so big time,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.520]   and I can't believe what he thinks.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.840]   He's just got a big head, literally, and prideful,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.480]   and I'm gonna, have you talked to him about this?
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.040]   Here's what I know about JP, he's not a perfect person.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.800]   He knows he's not a perfect person,
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.600]   and he wants to know the ways that, man,
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.240]   his imperfections have hurt someone, or wounded someone,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.400]   or maybe been misunderstood in ways
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.700]   that he could be more effective as a follower of Jesus,
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.620]   and so I'm gonna do this,
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.540]   you have 24 hours to go talk to him,
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.980]   and if you can't reach out in the next 24 hours,
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.460]   I'm gonna reach out,
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.780]   and I'm gonna tell him what you shared with me,
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.540]   and then collectively, we're all gonna get together
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.980]   and process through this,
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.180]   because this is clearly something
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.940]   that's important enough for you to share,
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.980]   and then I know if it's at that level,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.420]   it's gonna be important enough for JP,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.580]   he's gonna wanna learn, and know, and grow through it.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.260]   No, dude, don't do that, that's so awkward,
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.560]   oh my gosh, don't do that.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.620]   It's what the Bible commands us to do,
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.340]   and if you're someone who is having others share with you,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.420]   it's your role to tell them,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.820]   have you shared this with them,
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.820]   because you, whenever you don't do that,
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.220]   you become a part of the problem,
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:09.220]   you are equally guilty of tolerating gossip,
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.740]   and if you're talking bad about people,
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.700]   and it is happening in this room,
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.200]   it is a sin, talk to people, not about people,
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.920]   and Jesus says you go directly to them,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.720]   and here's what you do whenever, this is so huge,
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.200]   so if you kinda tuned out for just a second,
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.400]   come all the way back in here,
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.500]   stop counting the wood things, right here.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.900]   Here is how, here's what you do,
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.240]   whenever you go right to them, you go to them,
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.680]   and you address what's going on,
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.280]   here's what you need to do, it's so huge, I promise you,
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.880]   this is worth your money, right now,
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.080]   I'm about to give you exactly what you're gonna share
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.480]   with that person, so tune back in,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.120]   wherever you're listening from.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.840]   You focus on two things, two very specific things,
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:55.140]   whenever I go to them, the person's specific behavior,
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.760]   exactly the behavior, and the emotional response
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.980]   it created in me, you don't focus on motive,
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.980]   you don't focus on character, you're always,
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.860]   this is just who you are, you're a bad apple
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.760]   in a bad scene, I can't believe you, an unbelievable,
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.420]   you always, you don't focus on motive,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.020]   and when you do that, all you,
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.920]   you were just trying to make me look bad,
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.740]   that's what you were trying to do,
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.100]   you don't focus on motive, you focus on
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.900]   the specific behavior, and the emotional response
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.420]   it created in you, because you don't know motive,
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.380]   I don't know motive, we can assume, we can guess,
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.500]   we can presume, but as followers of Jesus,
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.400]   we're believing the best, here's the specific behavior,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.300]   when you said that about me in front of everyone,
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   it made me feel little, it hurt my feelings,
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.460]   I share exactly the specific behavior,
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.980]   and then the way that, when you told me
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.300]   that you were gonna come to that event,
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.240]   and then you kinda blew me off,
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.580]   or you didn't answer my phone call,
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.040]   12 days in a row, or 12 times in a row,
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.180]   it made me feel like you don't care about me,
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.520]   you focus on the specific behavior,
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.660]   and the emotional response that it created within you,
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.620]   you stay away from character, you stay away from motive,
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.980]   this will save you so much money
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.760]   in marriage counseling someday, I can't even tell you,
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.820]   if you will be someone who just says,
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.580]   this is the specific, I'm not gonna assume
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.480]   it's 'cause you disrespect me, 'cause you don't care
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.740]   about me, 'cause you're different, we think different,
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.260]   we communicate differently, I'm not gonna go
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.440]   and attack your character, I'm just gonna say,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.520]   this is the specific behavior,
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.540]   and this is the emotional response it created inside of me,
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:37.580]   and Jesus says, you go directly to that person,
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.840]   if they don't listen, he says, you go to step two,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.880]   which is this, if they will not listen,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.420]   you take one or two others along,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.720]   so that every matter may be established
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.280]   by the testimony of two or three witnesses,
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.240]   so Jesus says, you go to that person,
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:55.680]   you share with them either an area
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.140]   where you're seeing them live contrary to God's word,
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.440]   you're seeing them either sin against you,
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.000]   or just you see a sin in their life,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.480]   you love them enough to move in,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.460]   and to discuss that with them,
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.520]   and if they don't listen, he says,
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.720]   you just widen the circle, bring in another person,
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.240]   another follower of Jesus, or maybe two other followers
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.760]   of Jesus, ideally, they're objective,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.200]   they're not someone who, if you bring them with you,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.920]   they're gonna be like, great, they're teaming up on me,
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.760]   double team, and they're not gonna feel that,
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.200]   someone who's objective, who they know cares about 'em,
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.840]   and you widen the circle, and you say, look,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.840]   I pointed out with Kevin, that when he said this,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.540]   it hurt me, or this particular behavior in his life,
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.020]   I think is inconsistent with God's will,
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.780]   he's living contrary to God's word,
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.700]   but I may be wrong, will you help us together,
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.740]   collectively, work towards whatever God's best would be,
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.180]   or what God's word says, and if the person still goes,
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.700]   no, talk to the hand, you and God can talk to the hand,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.580]   I'm not listening, then it says,
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.360]   you do step three, Jesus says, which is this,
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.600]   if they still refuse, tell it to the church,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.960]   now the word church in this time,
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.800]   is just the word assembly, ekklesia is a Greek word
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.120]   that was here, used, and it just means the gathering,
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.760]   the assembly, it's more closely,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.480]   it's closer to a community group,
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.280]   if you're a Watermark member, or a small group,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.420]   if you're at another church, it's closer to that,
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.720]   than it is up here, it's not like,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.240]   all right, get 'em out here, here we go,
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.320]   this guy, you need to know, it's more closely,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.880]   tell it to his community group,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.500]   tell it to the community groups
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.340]   that may be represented and involved,
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:39.300]   and it says, if they still won't listen to the church,
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.760]   then deal on to step four,
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.300]   and if they refuse to listen to the church,
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.420]   treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector,
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.340]   so Jesus goes four steps, go to them individually,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.220]   widen the circle as necessary from there,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.580]   if they still continue to say,
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.940]   I don't care what the Bible says,
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.700]   then treat them as you would a pagan or tax collector,
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.160]   what is a pagan or a tax collector,
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.780]   and how, what does that mean?
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.640]   A pagan was essentially someone
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.200]   who just had no relationship with God,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.580]   he may have believed in the gods,
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.360]   but was not a follower of Christ,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.100]   same with a tax collector,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.220]   and Jesus says, that's the type of way
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.060]   you're gonna now treat them,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.020]   now how did Jesus, this is really important,
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.320]   how did Jesus treat pagans and tax collectors?
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.700]   Like, did Jesus just say, hey, if they still won't listen,
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.860]   then write 'em off, and blog about 'em,
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.780]   and talk mean about 'em on Facebook, no,
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.420]   Jesus loved pagans and tax collectors,
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.300]   he spent time with them, he invested in them,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.140]   he loved them, what is your response,
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.220]   and my response if someone says,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.740]   look, I'm just continuing,
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.900]   I don't care what the Bible says about marriage,
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.560]   I don't care what it says about premarital sex,
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.880]   I don't care what it says about life,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.140]   I don't care what it says about alcohol,
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.220]   I don't care what it says about money,
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.460]   I don't care about that stuff,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.540]   then you know how to treat that person
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.400]   as a pagan and tax collector,
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.460]   Jesus loved the pagan and tax collector,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.300]   he didn't write them out of their life,
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.200]   he didn't hold them to the same standard
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.780]   that he held followers of Christ to,
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.100]   in other words, followers of Christ said, follow me,
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.380]   to those who didn't share those values,
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.320]   didn't hold 'em that standard,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.580]   but he still loved those people,
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.380]   so you and I are to do with those in our life
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.740]   who continue to say, I don't care what God's word says,
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.420]   you don't write them off, you love them,
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.860]   like Jesus commanded us to,
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.060]   and you don't hold them to the same standards
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.500]   that you hold followers of Christ to,
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   so he indicates that there is a difference
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.120]   in the way that we treat a person,
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.840]   the way that we resolve relationships or conflicts,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.180]   based on whether or not they are a follower of Christ,
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.800]   and so now I'm gonna finish up
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.240]   with just a little bit of driving this home
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.120]   to make it super practical,
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.720]   as we talk through how do we resolve conflicts,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.480]   depending on if they are a believer or a non-believer,
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.180]   inside of our world and inside of our life,
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.720]   these are giant dice,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.320]   and they were made by an amazing member of our team,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.280]   and they will kinda lay out
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.600]   some of the four different arenas
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.480]   where most of us have conflict in life,
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   our family, our work, our dating relationships,
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.720]   and our friends, these are the four primary places
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.620]   that you and I are gonna have conflict,
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.400]   and they're usually gonna be with people,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.800]   no, they're always gonna be with people
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   who are either Christians or exes, non-Christians,
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.000]   and I don't know how else to convey that,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.440]   and so let's talk about it, let's set up a scenario
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   where hey, is a person, all right, great,
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.760]   so they are a non-believer,
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.800]   and they are a dating relationship,
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.160]   okay, you shouldn't be dating a non-believer,
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.200]   so we're gonna roll the dice again,
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.040]   they're a family member who is not a follower of Jesus,
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.480]   so maybe you have a sibling,
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:50.360]   true story, you should not date someone
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.080]   who's not following Christ,
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.160]   there's a lot of messages that we've done on that,
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.080]   and 2 Corinthians 6, 14 says you and I
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.400]   are not to be unequally yoked,
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.120]   if you want a recipe to have maximum conflict
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.440]   in your life and marriage, you should marry someone
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.160]   who doesn't have Jesus as the most important person
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.120]   in their life, so before we cover that,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.520]   and go into the family, now, onto family,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.360]   family, let's say that you have a sibling
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.600]   who's not a believer, you have a parent
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.920]   who's not a believer, what is you and I's role
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.340]   as it relates to resolving conflict?
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.480]   Maybe they've heard us by the tone that they've used,
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.680]   by the actions they've taken, by the manipulative patterns
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.440]   and the passive aggressive language that they use,
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.560]   what is you and I's role as it relates
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.920]   to resolving conflict with a sibling who's not a believer,
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.320]   or a parent who's not a believer?
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.640]   Maybe it's a sibling who's not a believer,
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.720]   you and I have the same role every single time,
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.280]   that you and I are to own our part in every conversation,
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.840]   anytime we can own our part, I'm gonna own my part,
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.800]   I wanna own anything I can,
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.720]   I could've communicated better,
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.800]   I could've been a better sibling,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.880]   I wanna own any of the ways that I was less
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.520]   than God's best to you, brother or sister,
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.840]   true family member, by that I mean a family member,
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.080]   I wanna own anything that I can,
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.920]   and then, they're not a believer, I'm gonna extend grace.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.560]   If they're not a believer and they act like
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.880]   they're not a believer, they're just fulfilling
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.440]   their job description, I'm not gonna hold them
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:11.040]   and be like, man, you should've been a lot kinder
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.340]   and more like Jesus, no, they're not a follower of Christ,
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.240]   and so I'm gonna own my part, I'm gonna extend grace,
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.000]   and I'm gonna seek to model Christ to that person.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.100]   What if they are a friend who is a believer?
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:29.300]   If they're a friend who's hurt me in some way,
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.520]   I'm gonna go to that person,
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.160]   and I'm gonna follow Jesus' four steps,
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.260]   I'm gonna identify the specific behavior,
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:39.500]   and how it made me feel, to them individually, privately,
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.380]   and if they won't listen and they reject that,
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.100]   then I'm gonna widen the circle as necessary.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:51.100]   What if they are a non-believer at work?
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.720]   I'm gonna do the same thing.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.600]   If a coworker's rude to me, maybe my boss is like,
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.680]   drops the F-bomb and I can't believe you,
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.340]   and you're terrible, what am I gonna do?
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.400]   I'm gonna own whatever I can.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.620]   I should've had that reporting quicker.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.960]   Will you please forgive me?
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.920]   How can I continue to grow and be a better employee?
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.760]   I'm gonna own whatever I can.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.180]   I'm gonna extend grace.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:23.560]   Not that there's never a time for you to help a leader
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.240]   that may be a non-believer,
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.400]   or a coworker that's a non-believer,
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.220]   over you, grow in their ability to communicate,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.720]   but by and large, I'm gonna assume,
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.160]   man, I'm gonna own my part, I'm gonna extend grace to them,
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.680]   and I'm gonna seek to show the love of Christ
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.720]   to that person inside of that workplace.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.760]   Over and over, the scripture commands
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.040]   this is what you and I are to do.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.440]   You don't have to stay in violent or workplaces
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.100]   that are leading you directly into sin,
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.560]   but you and I, as it relates to a work relationship,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.520]   or a coworker that is not a believer,
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.600]   I own my part, if I can own anything,
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.580]   and I extend grace, and I show them the love
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.040]   that Christ showed to me,
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.920]   in hopes that maybe God's gonna reach out,
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.360]   and through our relationship,
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.020]   invite 'em into a relationship with their Savior.
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.600]   What about if they're in a dating relationship,
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.500]   and they are a believer?
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.160]   That's probably a crucial one to talk about.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.200]   What if they're dating someone, and they are a believer?
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.560]   What does it look like to work through Matthew 18?
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.360]   Depending on the relationship, and the hurt that's involved,
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.160]   it wouldn't be inappropriate to go there,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.080]   depending on the relationship, and the hurt that's involved,
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.600]   to go and to ask for forgiveness,
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.480]   to own whatever part that you can,
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.620]   and to seek as best you can to leave that person
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.920]   better than you found them,
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.720]   to own the ways that you could've led them better,
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.220]   or brought more clarity to the relationship,
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.460]   to own the ways that you allowed insecurity,
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:58.960]   to govern, or to be the leader of your actions,
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.180]   more than the Spirit of God,
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.180]   or more than the faith that you hold to,
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.980]   that there's times that, man,
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.740]   it's totally appropriate and in balance,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.580]   and here's what's big.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.300]   Here's why, if you date a nonbeliever,
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.100]   you're gonna be set up for a lot of pain.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.560]   The pain that comes from dating,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.540]   or the conflicts that come from dating
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.700]   someone who's not following Jesus,
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.360]   are infinitely worse than the conflicts
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.800]   that are gonna come from someone who is.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.420]   I mean, truly, not just, hey, I'm a Christian,
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.260]   I'm at the porch.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.920]   Lot of non-followers of Jesus
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.380]   that attend the porch every week.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.740]   I mean, actually following Christ.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.160]   By and large, if you're dating someone,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.580]   the two of you are following Christ,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.420]   you're not gonna be like,
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.940]   I can't believe you cheated on me,
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.780]   and he slept with her, 'cause he's not sleeping with you.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.460]   He's someone who holds the idea of sexuality and sex
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.580]   as something that God gave
[00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.900]   as an incredible gift towards marriage.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.940]   So a lot of the pain and the heartache and the conflict
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.540]   and just the dysfunction of our dating relationships,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:53.980]   you will be protected from if you are consistent
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.860]   to date someone who is following Jesus
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.980]   with the life that they live.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.700]   And every conflict, you and I, as a wrap-up,
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.460]   have a perspective to have, it is not a bad thing.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.420]   It is an opportunity,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.020]   and one of the greatest opportunities that we have
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.900]   to honor Christ.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.620]   You and I have a part to own.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.140]   We always have a part to own.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:19.120]   And finally, you and I have a path towards peace
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.580]   that Christ has given us.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.420]   Let me close with this.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.740]   This is why this is such a big deal to God.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.700]   The Bible talks about conflict over and over and over again.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.060]   In Romans chapter 12, Ephesians chapter four,
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.040]   I mean, over and over and over again,
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.460]   almost like every book in the New Testament,
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.380]   it's like, man, you guys are gonna be diligent
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.540]   to preserve the unity of the Spirit
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.700]   and keep one another close in relationship.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.440]   Why is God so passionate about relationships being healed?
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.740]   Because the whole message of the Bible
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.020]   is about a relationship being healed.
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.980]   The message of the gospel, the good news of Jesus,
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.460]   and the good news of really the New Testament
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.380]   and the Bible in general is that you and I
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.020]   were in conflict with God.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.560]   You and I were, what the Bible says, children of wrath,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.620]   because of the sinful decisions that you and I have made,
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.700]   because the decisions in your life that you've made,
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.460]   you're ashamed of, nobody even knows about.
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:09.820]   Because of the decisions that you look back
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.780]   and you're just filled with embarrassment and regret,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.100]   and I can't believe that I did that,
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:15.300]   because of the decisions that you made this past weekend,
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   because of any sinful action that you and I take,
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.420]   we were in conflict with God.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.500]   We were by birth and by choice enemies of God.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.440]   And what did God do?
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.660]   What did the heart of God move him to do?
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.540]   The Bible says in Romans chapter five, verse eight,
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.760]   that God demonstrates his love for this
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.260]   while we were still in conflict.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.720]   While we had nothing and wanted nothing to do with God,
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.460]   while we were enemies of God,
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.060]   Jesus died for us and demonstrated God's love for us.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.740]   Why is God passionate about relationships being reconciled?
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.500]   That's the point of the Bible,
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.340]   is that all of us had this broken relationship
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:53.780]   and God said, I will lay down even my life
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.220]   to restore that relationship,
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.520]   to bring that healing involved to that relationship.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.640]   And now as the people of God who have peace with God,
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.900]   we go about and we introduce peace into the world around us
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.340]   and we say that not only can you have peace
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.820]   with one another, you can have peace with the God
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.760]   who's there, who would lay down even his life
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.600]   for his enemies.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.500]   I mean, think about that.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.960]   Jesus gave this radical ethic of love,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.460]   like love like our world has never seen.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.260]   I know our world thinks they know what love is all about.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.700]   They have no idea.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.460]   They think love is let me do whatever I want,
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.300]   whenever I want.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.120]   That's not loving.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:27.740]   Jesus introduces this radical love that says,
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.820]   I am willing to sacrifice whatever it takes
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.220]   for your good, for your benefit, even my own life.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.060]   And I will lay down, not for my friends
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.540]   and not for people who try really hard and do good things.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.840]   The Bible says that when you could do nothing,
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.300]   he ran towards you and laid his life down.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.100]   He's a God of such great love, he dies for his enemies.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.140]   Think about that.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:54.000]   What type of love dies for their enemies?
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.300]   We live in a world that's so fractured right now
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.820]   in every single direction, racist, racially, politically,
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.100]   sexually or sex, genders, and all these different things,
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.540]   all these different, everyone's looking to fight.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.500]   And God says, look, I'm not here to take sides,
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.340]   I'm here to take over this world.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.740]   And I gave my own life so that anyone wants,
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.440]   anyone who wants to know the God who was there
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.420]   can step into a relationship with me
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.660]   and I will bring about healing
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.180]   and they will become an agent of peace inside of this world.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:26.780]   There is no other message in all of our world
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.960]   like the message that Jesus brings.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.500]   There's no words inside of the book of the Quran
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.980]   of this picture of a God
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.900]   who's willing to even die for his enemies.
[00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.020]   Think about that.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.660]   American soldiers lay down their lives
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.900]   and say, we will die for ISIS.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.980]   That's crazy.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.700]   And yet that's the picture inside of the Bible.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:47.080]   That's the picture of the God who's there.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.780]   That's the picture that our God is passionate
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.480]   about you and I experiencing.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.760]   And when we begin to know and focus on him,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.040]   all of a sudden the conflicts,
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.180]   all of a sudden the ways that we were the victim
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.540]   and they hurt us and they did this to me,
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.540]   all of a sudden that shrinks compared to what God,
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.040]   after everything I did to him,
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.440]   was willing to do for me.
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:12.960]   If you've never had a moment where you have accepted
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.500]   the God who's there,
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.500]   the God unlike any other religion,
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.400]   the one true God who despite the fact
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.260]   that you as nice as you are are an enemy,
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:35.400]   unless you've accepted what he did on the cross
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.440]   and dying in your place and rising from the dead,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.600]   tonight is your night.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.040]   And he's so crazy about you having a restored relationship,
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.840]   not just with family and friends and dating and work people,
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.920]   but with him that he's already proven,
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.700]   I will go to any length necessary.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.240]   Does our world need more peace or what?
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.060]   Unlike any time I've ever seen,
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:03.120]   everyone is interested in just,
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.100]   you're the problem, you're the problem, you're the problem.
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.300]   And the body of Christ is quick to say,
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.860]   whenever they're at fault,
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:12.540]   here was the problem that I introduced and it was wrong.
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.640]   You can own whatever part you want or not.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.480]   You don't need to.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.660]   I'm not even gonna make that a part of the deal.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.260]   I want to make sure I own mine.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.180]   Because the God who's there,
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:26.140]   despite the fact that he did nothing wrong,
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.300]   would give his life for me.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.760]   And now I get to bring peace about that shows
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.800]   I'm one of his children.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.760]   I'm a peacemaker.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.520]   Let me pray.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:47.800]   I'm gonna do this.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   I'm gonna give us just a moment to pray wherever you are.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.520]   And I just want you to pray for the relationships
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.360]   inside of your life where you know you need to take action.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   I want you to pray for clarity to see your part.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:12.040]   And then I want you to pray for the body of Christ
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.960]   inside of our country,
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.200]   inside of everything that's going on in our world.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.280]   Inside of our country, inside of everything that's going on
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.080]   and all the noise and all the yelling
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.640]   that we would say, God, start with us.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:29.180]   Would you help us to be your people, us to bring the peace?
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:33.360]   78% of America claims to be Christian.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:39.160]   What would happen if 78% of the people in our country
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.720]   began to say, I'm gonna be a person who brings about peace?
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.800]   And so I'm gonna give you a minute to pray
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.840]   wherever you are for yourself,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.640]   for the relational conflict that you have,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.080]   and then for the body of Christ in general.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.840]   And then I'm gonna close this out
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.400]   and then we'll go into worship.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.980]   (gentle music)
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.560]   (gentle music)
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.140]   (gentle music)
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.720]   (gentle music)
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.300]   (gentle music)
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.880]   (gentle music)
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.460]   (gentle music)
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.040]   (gentle music)
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.180]   Father, would you help us to be peacemakers?
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:48.420]   Would you help us to resemble more the Prince of Peace,
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.860]   your Son, Jesus?
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:55.600]   I pray for just the relationships inside of this room
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.780]   where people know that they need to own their part.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.300]   They've been talking bad about people.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.660]   They've been unwilling to move in the direction
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.820]   of reconciling with people.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.540]   They've burned bridges behind them.
