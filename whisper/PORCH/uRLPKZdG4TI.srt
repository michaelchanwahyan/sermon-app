1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,500
 (phone dialing)

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,360
 - You have seven unheard messages.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,040
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,080
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,540
 - Hey yo, Danny!

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,240
 Where you at, bro?

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,080
 I'll see you soon, all right?

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,200
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,560
 but I feel like the Lord keeps putting me back

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,800
 on my heart for a reason.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,480
 So please call me back.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,820
 - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,120
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,600
 She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,040
 So hit me back, love you, bro.

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,800
 - Not sure if this is the right number,

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,720
 but last night was a mistake.

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,640
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,880
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,680
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,960
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,400
 and we need to talk.

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,680
 - All right, Porch, how we doing tonight?

25
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,320
 We doing okay?

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,720
 Hey, it's great to be with you.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,360
 Thanks for making the time to join us here

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,760
 on a Tuesday night.

29
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,080
 I'm so grateful that we get to do this every single week.

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,280
 I talk to the Lord early in the morning on Tuesday,

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
 and at the end of every day Tuesday,

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,960
 and what I find myself praying are prayers of gratitude

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,720
 that he is moving in the lives of people just like you

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,360
 in a generation just like ours.

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,680
 And so I'm so glad that you're here with us in Dallas.

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,520
 Thanks everybody that's tuning in online with us too.

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,480
 We're so grateful that God's not limited

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,360
 to just this one room, that he can meet with you

39
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,960
 anywhere, anytime, any place.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,080
 And that includes right now, special shout out

41
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,440
 to Porch Live, Dating Fort Worth, and Wheaton.

42
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,680
 Well, Porch, I don't know if you've heard the news,

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
 but after two years of dating,

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,520
 Travis Michael Kelsey and Taylor Allison Swift

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,080
 are officially engaged.

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,080
 (audience cheering)

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,840
 Taylor did the impossible.

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,160
 Like somehow in a single moment,

49
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,040
 she simultaneously fulfilled the hopes

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,920
 of all her adoring Swifties,

51
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,880
 while crushing the dreams of so many guys,

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,840
 I thought they actually stood a chance.

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,440
 And it could not have come a day too soon,

54
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,080
 because it's today that we are actually wrapping

55
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,560
 our dating series called We Need to Talk.

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
 It is no surprise.

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,400
 It's no surprise that many of you have been gathering

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
 with us in this room over the course

59
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,320
 of the last several weeks, because you wanna end up

60
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,480
 where these two lovebirds find themselves right now.

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,840
 You wanna move through this world,

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,600
 not alone, but with someone.

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
 And so you've stepped into this space alongside us,

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
 and we've been exploring what does God have to say

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,880
 about dating in romance, in relationships?

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,720
 Like as we look at the landscape of love,

67
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,880
 how do we navigate what feels like a tumultuous territory?

68
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,440
 And as we've been doing it, what we've said repeatedly

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,200
 over the course of this series is that dating

70
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,600
 is not a period of attachment, it's a period of assessment.

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,640
 And what you need to know is that that period

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,920
 of assessment is never more difficult.

73
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
 The great dating dilemma stands before you

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,520
 when you look at someone and say, you are so great.

75
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,360
 So why am I not attracted to you more?

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,620
 And that's the question we're gonna get into tonight,

77
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,580
 because we all know this feeling.

78
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,180
 Like on paper, you've looked at someone and said,

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,560
 man, they're the perfect match.

80
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,820
 Like they care about their body

81
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,320
 and they're motivated in life.

82
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,000
 Like they're actually trying to contribute to society.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,120
 They're moving up in the career world.

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,160
 And whenever we have a disagreement,

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,080
 like they don't bail out or pull away.

86
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,040
 Like they lean in and they try to process things with me.

87
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,680
 And I know that whenever I've taken them around my friends,

88
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
 my friends don't like any guy or girl

89
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,400
 that I ever bring around, and yet they all love them.

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,960
 And I never have to carry the conversation.

91
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,520
 I've had to do that so many times.

92
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,640
 But with this person, I don't have to carry

93
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
 the conversation, they actually contribute

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,260
 to the conversation.

95
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,000
 And yet, despite the fact that they look good on your arm,

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,520
 or they have the perfect romantic resume,

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,400
 and you've read it through multiple times,

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,760
 you can't help but look at them and say,

99
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,920
 man, you're so great, but something is still missing.

100
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,880
 What do you do in that situation?

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,020
 Well, that's what I wanna talk about with you tonight.

102
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,100
 Like any good diagnostic, what we have to do

103
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,880
 first and foremost though, is we have to triage

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,820
 the underlying issue if we're actually going to develop

105
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,440
 a suitable treatment plan.

106
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
 Which means that we need to get to the heart

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
 of why you're just not that into them.

108
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,320
 Which is a really easy question to ask,

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,360
 but admittedly, it is a harder question to answer.

110
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,560
 And the reason for that is the mind and the heart,

111
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,040
 they don't always agree.

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
 And we know this, like Bella, she knew.

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,400
 Jacob is a better suitor for me, but you know what?

114
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,340
 Like the heart wants what it wants,

115
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,360
 and I've gotta be with Edward instead.

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
 Like Rachel, she should have stuck with Bruce,

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,200
 but she ended up choosing Harvey Dent.

118
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,240
 Anyways, Katniss knew, Gail makes the most sense,

119
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,320
 and we all know that too.

120
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,120
 And yet she ended up with Peeta in the end.

121
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,400
 The heart wants what it wants,

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
 though the mind knows what it needs.

123
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,360
 And when those two things run in opposite directions,

124
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
 what happens is it leaves you more confused

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,640
 and less convinced about a relationship.

126
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
 You'll look at them and be like,

127
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,160
 you're legitimately amazing, a great person,

128
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,360
 but I'm just not attracted to you.

129
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
 I wish there was more there.

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
 Why is that the case?

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,120
 Because I don't wanna bail out on this thing.

132
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,920
 What is going on?

133
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,520
 What are you supposed to do?

134
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,460
 What is it that's missing?

135
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,040
 I'll tell you what's missing.

136
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,100
 It's chemistry.

137
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,040
 It's chemistry.

138
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,280
 That's what's missing.

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,120
 When they're so great,

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,200
 but you're just not attracted to them more.

141
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,360
 Like they have the right combination of character,

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,400
 but they have the,

143
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,420
 y'all have the wrong combination of chemistry.

144
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,120
 So what is the right combination then?

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,680
 Well, I was listening to an interview

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,280
 between Chris Williamson and a guy named Charlie Hooper,

147
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,920
 and they were answering the question,

148
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,200
 what do attractive men have most in common?

149
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,320
 You see, Charlie was answering this question

150
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
 as a guest to this podcast.

151
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,920
 And he is the primary voice

152
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,080
 when it comes to charisma coaching on YouTube.

153
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,960
 He has the biggest channel committed to this specific topic.

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,980
 And as they were discussing it,

155
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,980
 what Charlie said is that guys who are attractive,

156
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,320
 most often have in common these three things,

157
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,600
 that they are interesting in the sense

158
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,600
 that they can carry a compelling conversation.

159
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,240
 Number two, that they have standards,

160
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,760
 both how they want to live their life

161
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,700
 and who they want to live their life.

162
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,840
 They care about those things.

163
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,200
 And then lastly, they can build sexual tension,

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,700
 meaning they can be romantic,

165
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,180
 which I thought was just so interesting.

166
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,600
 Not because I thought, man, Charlie,

167
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,120
 you've really cracked the code on chemistry.

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
 That's not what I thought.

169
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,520
 I thought it was interesting because Charlie

170
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,660
 is catching up with God and his code for chemistry.

171
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,520
 You see, it's fascinating.

172
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
 The biblical concept of love

173
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
 is not like our English concept of love.

174
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
 Some of you know this,

175
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,960
 but in English, we only have one word for love,

176
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,360
 but actually in the Greek,

177
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,280
 there are four different words for love.

178
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,480
 And the first word is a word

179
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,240
 that we're so very familiar with.

180
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,480
 It's that word agape.

181
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,600
 It's the idea of godly love,

182
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
 the love that Jesus has shown for us himself,

183
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,000
 because it is self-sacrificing love.

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,360
 And this love is the kind of love

185
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
 that marks a person's character.

186
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,040
 You want to find someone with character,

187
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,200
 and so they need to have an agape love.

188
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,480
 But what you also know is that while the first love,

189
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,800
 agape, is all about character,

190
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,560
 the other three loves are all about chemistry.

191
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,920
 And what's interesting is those three loves

192
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,960
 correspond with the three things Charlie said

193
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,680
 in that podcast.

194
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,260
 You see, the first love is all about social chemistry.

195
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,440
 The second is all about romantic chemistry.

196
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,160
 And the third is all about emotional chemistry.

197
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,720
 You see, they characterize the kind of feeling

198
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,480
 you should have whenever you're engaged

199
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,000
 with another person in a relationship.

200
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,200
 So here's the truth.

201
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,080
 If you're lacking that loving feeling

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,360
 with somebody in a relationship,

203
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,920
 you're more than likely lacking one of these loves

204
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,040
 in that relationship.

205
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,840
 So what are they then?

206
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
 Well, that's what I want to talk with you about.

207
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
 I want to walk through these three loves.

208
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,660
 And really what I'm hoping you gather from it

209
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,480
 is there are three reasons you might feel reluctant

210
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,960
 in a relationship with someone.

211
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,040
 So the first one out of the gate is called phileo.

212
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,880
 Phileo.

213
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,360
 And it's brotherly love, which is why,

214
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,600
 and this is your very first point,

215
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,760
 a lack of friendship leads to a lack of love.

216
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,120
 A lack of friendship leads to a lack of love.

217
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,540
 The easiest way of remembering what phileo is about

218
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,840
 is it's the root of the word Philadelphia,

219
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,680
 which is the city of brotherly love.

220
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,080
 Now, when we say brotherly love,

221
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
 what we're saying there is that it's not love

222
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,260
 between two literal brothers,

223
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,560
 it's actually love between two friends.

224
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,880
 It's brotherly or friendship love.

225
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
 And we know that this type of love,

226
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,640
 it's meant to be characteristic between believers,

227
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,160
 brothers and sisters, as we relate to one another.

228
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,640
 Romans 12 10 tells us,

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,840
 "Let love be genuine, abhor what's evil,

230
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,300
 hold fast to what's good,

231
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,380
 love one another with brotherly affection."

232
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,140
 There it is, phileo.

233
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,440
 "And outdo one another in showing honor."

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,860
 But it's also the type of love

235
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,140
 that we should share in a romantic relationship.

236
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,340
 Song of Solomon 5 16 says this,

237
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,900
 "His mouth is most sweet, and he's altogether desirable.

238
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,980
 This is my beloved, and this is my friend,

239
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,440
 O daughters of Jerusalem."

240
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,500
 Notice the way the woman identifies her husband

241
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,100
 in this passage.

242
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,420
 She doesn't just say, "He's my beloved,

243
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,980
 he is my darling, my soulmate,

244
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,620
 he is the father of my unborn children."

245
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,020
 That's not what she says alone.

246
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,240
 She says, "He is her beloved,"

247
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,460
 but she also says, "He is my friend,"

248
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,660
 which means the basis of their relationship

249
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,940
 is not just this bottomless pit of passion.

250
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,500
 Like they just don't have this deep angst of desire

251
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,860
 where they have to spend every waking moment

252
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,500
 with each other.

253
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,260
 What she just said is our relationship is fun.

254
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,420
 There's an element to our time together

255
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,660
 that is actually enjoyable.

256
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,980
 Because that's the major distinction

257
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,620
 when you think about friendship.

258
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,420
 Like what value does friendship offer?

259
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,500
 You don't have to be roommate,

260
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,180
 you don't have to be friends with your roommates.

261
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,660
 You don't have to be friends with your colleagues.

262
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,580
 You don't have to be friends even with your family.

263
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,900
 It doesn't have to be productive in that sense.

264
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,660
 So then what good are friends for?

265
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,140
 Friends, they're good for joy.

266
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,540
 That's what they provide in this world.

267
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,580
 That's what they principally exist for.

268
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,020
 As C.S. Lewis said, "Friendship is unnecessary,

269
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,740
 "like philosophy, like art.

270
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,700
 "It has no survival value.

271
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,480
 "Rather, it is one of those things

272
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,820
 "which gives value to survival."

273
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,720
 I've been visited with so many young adults

274
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,220
 who find themselves in a dating situation

275
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,420
 where the other person is top of class

276
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,060
 in so many different ways.

277
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,340
 They have impeccable character.

278
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,920
 They've got an incredible job.

279
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,220
 They're motivated in life.

280
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,700
 They are not just trying to serve themselves.

281
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,300
 They're really trying to serve other people.

282
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,060
 They volunteer at the local homeless shelter.

283
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,900
 They're trying to make sure that they're giving

284
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,100
 of their wealth for the benefit of other people.

285
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,020
 They also want two and a half kids too.

286
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,940
 And yet, though all of this is true,

287
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,220
 they bore you to tears.

288
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,580
 [audience laughs]

289
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,980
 And it's not their fault.

290
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,500
 You see, the reality is you just don't have

291
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,380
 anything in common with that person.

292
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,300
 No mutual interests, no shared hobbies,

293
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,840
 no like-minded pastimes.

294
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,460
 And that stuff matters.

295
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,720
 Like in 1926, Clive Staples Lewis

296
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,860
 met one John Ronald Ruhle Tolkin.

297
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,100
 Initially upon the meeting,

298
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,140
 Lewis noted some apprehension about him.

299
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,100
 He wrote that Tolkin was a smooth, pale,

300
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,780
 fluent little chap who only needed a smack or so.

301
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,100
 And yet what's fascinating is it was through

302
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,420
 their mutual love and common interest

303
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,340
 in northern myths and storytelling and poetry

304
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,980
 and fantasy worlds that their friendship,

305
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,340
 it was not only born, but it blossomed.

306
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,020
 And these two fledgling novelists,

307
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
 they would encourage one another as they wrote

308
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,780
 to the point that Lewis eventually encouraged

309
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,980
 Tolkin to have published this little children's storybook

310
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,540
 that he was so self-conscious about,

311
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,620
 which we know is "The Hobbit."

312
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,600
 What's my point?

313
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,060
 Friendship is built on common bonds,

314
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,820
 and those bonds matter.

315
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,620
 They're not only good to have in life,

316
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,820
 they are really good to have in love

317
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,680
 because it's good to have things in common

318
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,820
 with the person you're dating.

319
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,620
 Now, am I saying that you have to have

320
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,220
 everything in common with that person?

321
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,300
 No, that's not what I'm saying.

322
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,140
 Like, you don't have to break up with her

323
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,200
 just because she's not into micro-brewing beer

324
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,900
 in her garage the way that you are.

325
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,420
 Like, Brooke and I, we don't have everything in common.

326
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,220
 Like, she loves running.

327
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,640
 I hate running.

328
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,120
 So we don't run.

329
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,300
 I like action movies.

330
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,460
 She likes rom-coms.

331
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,940
 So we watch action movies.

332
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,740
 Like, you don't need to have everything in common,

333
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,900
 but here's the thing, and listen to me,

334
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,580
 you need to have some things in common

335
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,780
 so that way the basis of the bond you build

336
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,380
 is bigger than, well, at least she's hot,

337
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,180
 or, you know, at least he's rich.

338
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,060
 Proverbs 18, 24 says,

339
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,900
 "A man of many companions comes to ruin,

340
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,180
 "but there's a friend who sticks closer than a brother."

341
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,700
 You hear that?

342
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,820
 Like, that's the kind of bond that friendship can build.

343
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,540
 Like, in a world where you can have many companions

344
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,600
 and yet still come to ruin,

345
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,580
 but there's a friend who can bond close to you

346
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,980
 so that way you're able to endure difficulty,

347
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,700
 that's a powerful force.

348
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,460
 That's the kind of bond available to you,

349
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,420
 one where someone sticks close,

350
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,500
 they hold fast, they push through,

351
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,100
 and you want that sort of bond in your marriage,

352
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,380
 which is why this kind of social chemistry matters.

353
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,880
 That's why friendship is important.

354
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,500
 I remember realizing this for myself.

355
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,060
 I was dating a girl in college

356
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,020
 who truly was one of the most incredible people

357
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,740
 that I had ever met.

358
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,220
 She was smart.

359
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,420
 Like, she was planning on graduating

360
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,720
 and going straight into getting her master's,

361
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,600
 and she was goofy.

362
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,380
 Like, you never saw her without a smile on her face.

363
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,780
 She was always cracking a joke

364
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,820
 and trying to get the room a little bit brighter,

365
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,340
 and she was so selfless.

366
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,340
 Like, she volunteered her time every single week

367
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,580
 with the boys in the girls' club in town,

368
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,780
 and she loved Jesus.

369
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,340
 Like, not just the kind of love for Jesus

370
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,000
 where she's a Christian,

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,820
 but she really tried to walk with him

372
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,240
 and look like him and live like him.

373
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,420
 And yet, I remember,

374
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,260
 it was a couple of months into our relationship

375
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,200
 that it dawned on me,

376
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,600
 we are two good people,

377
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,480
 but we're not two good friends.

378
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,380
 You see, we didn't have much in common.

379
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,460
 Conversations would fall flat,

380
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,040
 though we would really work at them.

381
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,760
 Our time together, it just grew more difficult.

382
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,520
 And when I realized this, it just, it sucked,

383
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,640
 because she was amazing,

384
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,240
 and I saw, like, man, this would really work.

385
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,680
 And yet, I knew

386
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
 she deserves to be enjoyed

387
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,620
 in a way that I cannot enjoy her,

388
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,240
 and so we ended things.

389
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,300
 Friends, listen, every person you date

390
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,420
 is someone God deeply delights in,

391
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,060
 and so every person you date

392
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,700
 should be someone you deeply delight in.

393
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,100
 And if you don't,

394
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,500
 like, if getting together with that person

395
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,780
 just, like, stirs up in you some sort of dread,

396
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,740
 like, ah, man, it's so hard to ride in the car together

397
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,620
 or keep conversations going

398
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,340
 or to joke around or to be nonchalant,

399
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,000
 like, whatever it is,

400
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,340
 you need to know

401
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,580
 that maybe you're not feeling it

402
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,660
 because you're just not friends.

403
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,700
 And I wanna love you enough to say,

404
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,740
 that is so okay,

405
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,340
 but it is not enough.

406
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,220
 And the reason I know is because Jesus' love for you,

407
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,660
 for me,

408
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,660
 was formed not only on a foundation of duty

409
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,460
 that I need to save them from their sin,

410
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,080
 it was formed on a foundation of desire.

411
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,680
 I want to save my friends.

412
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,020
 Because John 15, 13 tells us,

413
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,620
 "Greater love has no one than this

414
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,420
 "that someone laid down his life for his friends."

415
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,120
 Meaning, if you want great love in this life,

416
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,820
 it'll take more than a great relationship

417
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,700
 with a really great person.

418
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,220
 It's gonna take a great relationship

419
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,120
 with a really great friend,

420
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,400
 the kind of friend that would lay down their own life

421
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
 for you too.

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,160
 But it's also gonna take more than that.

423
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,120
 That's only one type of love.

424
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,680
 There's another kind of love that we need to look at next,

425
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,560
 which is the love of eros.

426
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,520
 Eros, which is passionate love, romantic love.

427
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,400
 And the reason why you need this love

428
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,200
 is because a lack of passion leads to a lack of love.

429
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,720
 A lack of passion leads to a lack of love.

430
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,440
 You see, eros is the root of the English word erotic.

431
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,960
 And really what it represents is the kind of love

432
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,760
 two people share with one another

433
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,480
 in a romantic or sexual kind of capacity.

434
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,720
 It's really, it's intended to be reserved specifically

435
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,920
 for those husbands and wives bound together

436
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
 in covenantal union.

437
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,280
 And yet, because in the Greco-Roman world,

438
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,720
 as well as ours, we had our way with it.

439
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,760
 We see in the New Testament,

440
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,680
 they don't use this word specifically.

441
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,800
 Like it had become so debased

442
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,200
 at the time of the New Testament authorship

443
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,400
 that the authors themselves decided

444
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 to not use this word for fear of confusing their readers

445
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
 that eros was okay outside of marriage.

446
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,620
 And yet, that doesn't mean that the word itself

447
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,920
 or the concept it represents is intrinsically evil

448
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,800
 or it's impure in any kind of way.

449
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,600
 In fact, this concept, sexual love,

450
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,880
 romantic love, passionate love,

451
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,320
 it is represented consistently across the scripture.

452
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
 (crickets chirping)

453
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,160
 And the reason why is because this kind of love

454
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,120
 is a beautiful thing.

455
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,640
 Like it's procreative,

456
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,720
 meaning it has the literal power to create life.

457
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,600
 Have you ever thought about that?

458
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,920
 Like the difference between no baby and a baby is eros.

459
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 Like that's how it happens.

460
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,960
 I don't know if you've ever learned that,

461
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,160
 but that's the way this thing works.

462
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,640
 Like eros, passionate sexual love,

463
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,240
 literally has the ability to create life.

464
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,520
 That's why we call it the miracle of life

465
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,600
 because it's that powerful.

466
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,060
 But here's the thing, catch me on this.

467
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,160
 It's not just procreative, it's also recreative,

468
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,160
 meaning it's not just powerful, it's also pleasurable.

469
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,820
 Proverbs 5, 18, 19 says,

470
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,360
 "Let your fountain be blessed

471
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,100
 "and rejoice in the wife of your youth,

472
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,480
 "a lovely dear, a graceful doe.

473
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,680
 "Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight.

474
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,880
 "Be intoxicated always in her love."

475
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,680
 Every guy in the room just woke up.

476
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,760
 (audience laughing)

477
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,400
 Is that in the Bible?

478
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,240
 Yes, that's the Bible.

479
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,240
 Like it just told us something really important

480
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,400
 about this kind of love.

481
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,980
 And I'm not gonna get into all the mechanics

482
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,720
 of what that's really describing in that specific passage,

483
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,400
 but what you do need to know

484
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 is that's not talking about procreation.

485
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,520
 That is talking about pleasure, enjoying one another.

486
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,720
 And this is so important.

487
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,920
 Sex is a gift.

488
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,840
 It is from God.

489
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,160
 It is meant to feel good.

490
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,320
 You should touch and there will be sparks.

491
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,360
 Things might get steamy at some point.

492
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 And that's all true because romantic chemistry matters,

493
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,560
 which I know as I say that, like you're like,

494
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,120
 yeah, man, romantic chemistry matters.

495
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
 You know that, that feels so obvious

496
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
 because every time you touch, you get this feeling.

497
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 Like that's true for so many of you.

498
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,480
 And yet that's not true for every one of you.

499
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,640
 You see, so many of you, you live in a world

500
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,960
 where your romantic chemistry is at a surplus.

501
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,120
 And that comes with its own problems,

502
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,680
 which we have talked about in this series.

503
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,460
 But there are others of you where your romantic chemistry,

504
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,760
 it exists at a deficit.

505
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,220
 And it's why attraction struggles between the two of you.

506
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,400
 Why is that?

507
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,160
 Well, there's a couple of reasons why.

508
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,680
 The first is the absence of physical attraction.

509
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,260
 The absence of physical attraction.

510
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,120
 Like there's a reason why Conrad and Jeremiah

511
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,240
 got so in the belly when she came back from the summer.

512
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,840
 And it's because she turned pretty, right?

513
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,800
 Physical attraction ultimately matters.

514
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,480
 And the Bible isn't shy about this fact.

515
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,760
 And listen to me because this is really important.

516
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,320
 I'm not just telling you what I think.

517
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,080
 This is from the scripture itself.

518
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,560
 The Bible frequently introduces characters as attractive.

519
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,360
 We know, and this is not a comprehensive list,

520
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,300
 but these are just some examples.

521
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,560
 Sarah was so striking that both Pharaoh

522
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,120
 and King Abimelech took her from Abraham.

523
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,680
 Rachel was beautiful in figure and appearance.

524
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,040
 Joseph was well-built and handsome.

525
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,440
 David was ruddy with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance.

526
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,000
 Absalom was flawless from head to foot

527
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,720
 with thick wavy hair.

528
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,600
 It was said that there was none like him in all Israel.

529
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,060
 Esther was so lovely that King Xerxes chose her

530
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,960
 to be his queen.

531
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
 And yet here's the thing,

532
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,360
 the Bible doesn't just introduce them as attractive people

533
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,520
 so that way you feel this need

534
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,880
 to become as beautiful as you can.

535
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,400
 That's not why they're introduced this way.

536
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,600
 Whenever the Bible takes time to really explain something,

537
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
 it's purposeful.

538
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,420
 And so it begs the question,

539
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,880
 what's the purpose that the scriptures are trying

540
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,140
 to tell us by way of introducing their physical features?

541
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,680
 What it's trying to help us understand

542
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,400
 is that attraction always leads to something.

543
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,460
 That's what happened for them.

544
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,880
 For some of them, it led them into political influence.

545
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
 For others, it put them in positions where their charisma

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,560
 ultimately served or disserved the people of God.

547
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,320
 But for many of them, it just led them into marriage.

548
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,480
 You see, catch me, attraction

549
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,240
 leads to desire.

550
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,540
 Attraction leads to desire.

551
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,980
 Song of Solomon four, seven through eight, it says,

552
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,380
 "You are altogether beautiful, my love.

553
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,180
 "There's no flaw in you.

554
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,960
 "So come, come with me from Lebanon, my bride.

555
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,620
 "Come with me from Lebanon."

556
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,100
 Do you hear it?

557
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,460
 Like he just articulated attraction.

558
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,300
 You are altogether beautiful.

559
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,020
 And it led to desire.

560
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,960
 So come on, come away with me.

561
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,980
 We gotta get out of here.

562
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,900
 Have you seen you?

563
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,200
 I've gotta get you away from this place.

564
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,320
 We need to escape to the hills.

565
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,540
 That's the kind of perspective Solomon has in this moment

566
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,900
 because he knows everyone deserves

567
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,300
 to be desired in a relationship.

568
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,700
 And attraction is one of the primary catalysts for that.

569
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,780
 So then what makes someone attractive?

570
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,940
 Well, if you ask evolutionary biologists

571
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,700
 or behavioral psychologists,

572
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,820
 what you'll find is they have a lot to say on the topic.

573
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,880
 I know because I did so much reading.

574
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,040
 Part of me cannot wait to be done with this series

575
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,000
 'cause I am so sick of researching dating

576
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
 and relationships in our modern world.

577
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,960
 And yet as I have listened to everything they have to say,

578
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,600
 some of which is really brilliant,

579
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,560
 what you need to know is it just depends.

580
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,360
 Like who you find attractive really depends.

581
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,740
 It depends on your context and your environment

582
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,980
 and the stressors in your life

583
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,560
 and the needs that you have.

584
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,900
 And it even depends on the economy.

585
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,300
 I thought this was fascinating.

586
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,780
 According to research,

587
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,380
 American playboy centerfolds correspond

588
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,860
 with our current economic condition.

589
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,300
 If the economy is bad, the model's weight goes up.

590
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,500
 And if the economy is good, the model's weight goes down.

591
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,540
 Why, why is that the case?

592
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,660
 Because throughout history,

593
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,660
 people have consistently found the exotic as attractive.

594
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,060
 It's the unfamiliar, it's the unnatural

595
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,620
 that people want to gravitate towards.

596
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,980
 And it's not just through history,

597
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,140
 it's even here in our modern moment.

598
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,180
 In America, the standard of beauty is you need to be tan

599
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,020
 and you need to be ripped up

600
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,060
 because it's a sign of health and status.

601
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,960
 But if you go back into the Renaissance era,

602
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,020
 what you find is that women were painted

603
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,260
 with formerly figures.

604
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,220
 And the reason why is because that was indicative

605
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,300
 of fertility and wealth.

606
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,300
 If you go to Japan and you look at the Geisha,

607
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,520
 they would paint their faces white

608
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,980
 because it met the cultural standards

609
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,660
 and ideals of the day.

610
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,860
 It left them looking fair-skinned

611
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,540
 with very distinct features.

612
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,060
 You see, the point in all of this

613
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,320
 is there's no universal standard for beauty.

614
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,660
 Like you're going to find someone attractive

615
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,860
 that someone else doesn't and vice versa.

616
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,300
 But though there is no universal standard for beauty,

617
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,180
 there is a personal standard for beauty.

618
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,320
 Every one of us will find someone attractive.

619
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,780
 You have a standard.

620
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,560
 So then let me ask you, what is your standard?

621
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,060
 What's your standard?

622
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,860
 For some of you, your standard's too high.

623
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,460
 Like if you're only attracted to pictures of people

624
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,020
 that fill your explore page

625
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,980
 and you're never attracted to the faces of real people,

626
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,900
 then your standard is too high.

627
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,420
 If you walk into a room this big with this many people

628
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,260
 and you walk out and you think,

629
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,900
 "Yeah, you know, there's a couple of people there

630
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,020
 "that I might be interested in."

631
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,840
 I promise you, your standard is too high.

632
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,660
 If your dating poll is limited

633
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,260
 to the random people you choose to DM

634
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,100
 as opposed to the real people available in live,

635
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,280
 your standard is too high.

636
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,540
 If you're looking for the hottest this-is-her girl,

637
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,340
 then listen, you better be the hottest this-is-him guy

638
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,420
 because your standard will be too high.

639
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,180
 I remember I had a friend who looked at me

640
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,300
 when I was in college and this is advice

641
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,500
 that I have taken to the bank

642
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
 because I believe in it so much.

643
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,040
 You don't hold someone to some standard

644
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,940
 you are unwilling to hold yourself to.

645
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,500
 And I remember when he told me that, my jaw hit the floor.

646
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,900
 And it was so helpful because it helped me to realize

647
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,140
 just how unfair I was being.

648
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,900
 For others, it's not that your standard's too high,

649
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
 it's that your standard's too narrow.

650
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,460
 You have a very specific type, tall, dark, and handsome.

651
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,300
 And that's okay.

652
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,100
 You know, I'm not diminishing

653
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,620
 where preferences play into dating,

654
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,380
 but I do just wanna tell you this.

655
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,700
 If you let your type tyrannize your dating experience,

656
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,380
 then you're gonna miss out on really great people.

657
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,060
 It's a running joke in my marriage between Brooke and I.

658
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,500
 I'm not her type.

659
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,900
 She's dark-skinned, dark-haired,

660
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,180
 so she just always kind of assumed

661
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,660
 I'd find a dark-skinned, dark-haired guy,

662
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,140
 which is clearly not me.

663
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,840
 I'm not dark-skinned, dark-haired.

664
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,380
 Why do I tell you that?

665
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,340
 Because you don't wanna count someone out

666
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,640
 just because they don't fit what you expected.

667
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,180
 Like, if you're looking for a specific set of features

668
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,740
 in a partner, your standard is too narrow.

669
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,260
 Guys, listen, her waist-to-hip ratio

670
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,580
 doesn't need to be a perfect 0.7.

671
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,940
 Ladies, he does not need to have a perfectly groomed beard,

672
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,500
 a broad set of shoulders, and curly hair

673
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,520
 that you can run your fingers through.

674
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,680
 That is too narrow a standard.

675
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,080
 And lastly, for some of you, your standard's too low.

676
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,980
 If you're dating someone who is legitimately amazing,

677
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,120
 like they have great character

678
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,380
 and they're a really good friend,

679
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,900
 but you're just not attracted to them,

680
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,100
 it could be that your standard is too low.

681
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,700
 And I wanna be very clear with you.

682
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,200
 Physical attraction is not everything,

683
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,980
 but it is something.

684
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,780
 So what's the right standard then?

685
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,180
 The right standard is that they are attractive enough

686
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,700
 that you are grateful to be going out with them,

687
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,920
 but you're not gutted if they choose to leave.

688
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,420
 That's the right standard.

689
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,740
 And let me be clear, physical attraction can grow.

690
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,240
 Some of you, you're looking at the relationship you're in

691
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,420
 and you're like, man, they're amazing.

692
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,260
 Everything about them is so awesome.

693
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,300
 I'm like, yes, like Colin,

694
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,420
 they have everything we just talked about.

695
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,500
 We're amazing friends.

696
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,780
 Like we laugh together a lot.

697
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,180
 We've made some incredible experiences.

698
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,380
 We've gone out and we have shared in moments,

699
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,380
 the likes of which I'm gonna remember

700
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,460
 for a really long time.

701
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
 I don't know that I'll ever be attracted to them,

702
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,960
 but it's hard to give this up.

703
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,860
 You play the long game, you go slow.

704
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,100
 Physical attraction can grow.

705
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,460
 It's absolutely possible.

706
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,100
 But let me just say this.

707
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:42,900
 No person, no one is attractive to everyone,

708
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,300
 but everyone is attractive to someone.

709
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,320
 Assuming they try, you know,

710
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,940
 like they brush their teeth and they fix their hair

711
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,460
 and they don't just put on wrinkled clothes.

712
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,140
 They will be attractive to someone.

713
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,900
 So don't rob them.

714
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,760
 Please don't rob them of being found physically desirable

715
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
 in the same way that you want to be found

716
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,380
 physically desirable yourself.

717
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,380
 That's the first reason there might be a deficit

718
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,340
 in your romantic chemistry.

719
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,580
 The second reason is not the absence of physical attraction,

720
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,040
 but the presence of romantic apprehension.

721
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,900
 I think I've shared this in here before,

722
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
 but according to the National Sexual Violence

723
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,780
 Resource Institute, one in four girls

724
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,980
 and one in six boys have been sexually abused

725
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,960
 before the age of 18.

726
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,460
 I tried to look up and see, is there an average

727
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,620
 for how many dates or relationships someone will go through

728
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,100
 before they eventually get married?

729
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,620
 And there is no average for that.

730
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,860
 It varies across the board, but the reality is

731
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,720
 if it's one in four girls and one in six guys,

732
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,720
 more than likely in your dating journey,

733
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,260
 you're going to cross paths with someone

734
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,460
 that has been impacted by sexual abuse in their story.

735
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,100
 So what do you do in that moment?

736
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,140
 If you're dating someone who has been abused,

737
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,560
 let me speak very clearly.

738
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,080
 You do not push them or pressure them physically.

739
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,660
 You take your cues from them.

740
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,700
 You move on their time.

741
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,360
 And if they won't give you one,

742
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,380
 you anticipate you're gonna go slow.

743
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,860
 I remember I had a friend who asked me

744
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,680
 right before Brooke and I got married,

745
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,960
 and it's a question I've adopted,

746
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,100
 and I ask every groom that I officiate the wedding of.

747
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,700
 He said, "Kylin, what does it look like to love Brooke well

748
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,600
 "if things don't go as you expect on your wedding night?"

749
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,640
 And I thought that was the greatest recalibrating question

750
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,100
 because it reminded me what matters most.

751
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,720
 My love to that woman is service at all times

752
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,900
 and in all ways, even in our most intimate moment.

753
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,940
 Let that be the case for you.

754
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,900
 And then let me speak to the person in the room

755
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,660
 that's been abused at some point in the past.

756
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,780
 I just wanna look at you and I wanna say,

757
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,840
 it's not your fault.

758
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,520
 You didn't do that to yourself.

759
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,920
 You don't deserve to live with the damage.

760
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,540
 You take as much time as you need,

761
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:28,060
 but keep moving forward.

762
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,620
 You go little by little.

763
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,380
 You take the steps, whether they be big or they be small,

764
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,740
 but you keep moving.

765
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,180
 And the reason why is because God has really good plans

766
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,020
 for your life.

767
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,100
 And I want you to trust Him enough to believe it.

768
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,340
 Like, don't let the past that someone took from you

769
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,080
 rob you of the future God wants to give you.

770
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,860
 You trust Him.

771
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,680
 You walk with Him.

772
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,520
 You listen to Him.

773
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,300
 You move with Him.

774
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,280
 'Cause I promise He's leading you to a better place.

775
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,380
 Great relationships, they share really great romance.

776
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,740
 It's always within the confines of marriage.

777
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,020
 I'm gonna stop making that caveat.

778
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,900
 And yet it's why romantic chemistry matters.

779
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,860
 Here's the thing.

780
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,180
 How do you test for it?

781
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,980
 Well, I've got really good news for you.

782
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,580
 You never have to touch the other person

783
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,220
 in order to figure it out.

784
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,140
 Because you can simply consider,

785
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,660
 have I screenshot a text he ever sent to me?

786
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,860
 Like when he speaks, do those words like linger in my mind

787
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,520
 and make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside?

788
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,040
 When I come into a room, am I looking for her

789
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
 first and foremost?

790
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,680
 Do I wanna find her in this space?

791
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,080
 When our arms magically brush against one another,

792
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,920
 was that intentional?

793
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,040
 Did he mean to touch my arm?

794
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,960
 Did I mean to touch his arm?

795
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
 Should we touch arms again?

796
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,680
 You know, like those are indicatives

797
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
 that there's some romantic chemistry.

798
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,640
 And there's some possibility for passion.

799
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,400
 Here's the last one.

800
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,420
 The third love is the love of storge.

801
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
 Storge.

802
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,980
 It's a familial or it's a natural love.

803
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
 And the reason you need to know it

804
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,380
 is because a lack of care leads to a lack of love.

805
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,780
 When I say natural, don't think basic.

806
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,600
 That's not what I mean.

807
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,860
 When I say natural, what I want you to think of

808
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,780
 is instinctive.

809
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
 Like it's an instinctive love.

810
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,120
 It's the kind of love that a mother shares

811
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,540
 with her newborn child.

812
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,700
 The early church, they represented this really well

813
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,340
 because they supported and they cared

814
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,760
 and they provided for one another.

815
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,700
 We see it in Acts 2, 44 through 46.

816
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,780
 And all who believed, they were together

817
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,060
 and they had all things in common

818
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,460
 and they were selling their possessions

819
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,940
 and their belongings and they were distributing

820
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,940
 the proceeds to all as any had need.

821
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,780
 And day by day, attending the temple together

822
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,220
 and they were breaking bread in their homes,

823
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,820
 they received their food with glad and generous hearts.

824
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,980
 And here's the cool thing.

825
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,980
 It's not just a picture of what should be true of us,

826
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,340
 it's a picture of what's true of God.

827
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,100
 Like if you go and you read through the Old Testament,

828
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,260
 you see that God is frequently represented

829
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,000
 with a paternal instinct.

830
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,340
 There's a lot of scripture.

831
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,240
 I had to cut a bunch, but I'll give you this one

832
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,420
 'cause I think it's probably the most representative

833
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,740
 of this quality.

834
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,900
 Isaiah 49, 15 says, "Can a woman forget her nursing child?

835
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,720
 "That she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?

836
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,960
 "Even these may forget,

837
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,180
 "yet I, the Lord, will not forget you."

838
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,500
 See, the word compassion in this passage,

839
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,760
 it's really at the heart of what we're talking about

840
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,060
 conceptually when we consider storge

841
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,460
 this familial or natural love

842
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,200
 because compassion is closely related in the Hebrew

843
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,180
 to the word for womb.

844
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,220
 It's rakum and rakim.

845
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,460
 Those are the two words.

846
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,060
 And the reason that even matters to us

847
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,680
 is because what it tells us

848
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,540
 is the kind of love that God has for you

849
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,100
 is a love that is nurturing in nature.

850
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,980
 And because he has that, we should have it with one another.

851
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,480
 And yet when it's missing, that's really concerning.

852
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,660
 So if you're in a relationship where,

853
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,860
 and maybe they are awesome for all the reasons

854
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,480
 that we have already previously spoken about,

855
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,460
 like you look at them and it's like,

856
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,160
 you are everything and more that I should want in life.

857
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,780
 You have filled out my checklist.

858
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,100
 You have met every criteria I have ever thought.

859
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,220
 And yet when you start telling them about what your mom said

860
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,220
 and I think it really hurts you,

861
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,420
 and you know, like she just continues to project the fact

862
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,340
 that I don't love my sister,

863
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,700
 I care way too much about my job.

864
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,580
 If their response to you is, huh?

865
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,500
 Yeah, no way, that's crazy.

866
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,080
 So what do you want to do for dinner?

867
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,680
 That's concerning.

868
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,800
 Like that's not a great sign.

869
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,480
 Like you're looking for someone

870
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,040
 that you have emotional chemistry with.

871
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,920
 That's the idea.

872
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,320
 You want to marry someone

873
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,200
 that doesn't just care about hanging out and hooking up.

874
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,800
 You want to marry someone that cares about how you're doing.

875
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,840
 And I'll just level with you on this

876
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,180
 because I don't think this is going to catch anybody off guard

877
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,080
 but ladies, you're traditionally better at this than guys.

878
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,440
 Like you are more fluent in the language of your feelings

879
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,420
 than men.

880
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,260
 And I'm not trying to stereotype.

881
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,400
 You can look up the research.

882
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,600
 It makes perfect sense.

883
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,600
 Because for guys, our typical orientation is task leaning.

884
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,140
 Like we would all be quite all right

885
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:09,140
 if our day consisted of work, eat, TV, sleep.

886
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,260
 But in a relationship, it's not going to look like that

887
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,300
 because you're going to say work

888
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,180
 and she's going to want to say, oh my gosh, like what happened?

889
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,740
 I knew you were talking to your boss today.

890
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,580
 How did that conversation go?

891
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,700
 Did he accept your proposal?

892
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,340
 Wait, hold on, coworkers, what are their names?

893
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,220
 Remind me one more time.

894
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,420
 Okay, oh, I thought that was David.

895
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,260
 Okay, so, so sorry.

896
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,620
 Like you're going to hear that from her

897
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,780
 or she's going to walk in

898
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,900
 and she's going to see you watching a show.

899
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,580
 She's like, oh my gosh, like I don't even know what this is.

900
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,860
 What is this show?

901
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,740
 Should we watch it together?

902
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,580
 Catch me up.

903
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,120
 And you're like, I'm in season three, episode eight.

904
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,660
 And I don't have time to catch you up

905
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,340
 on what's happening in this moment.

906
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,780
 Like, this is the case.

907
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,300
 It's not that she's trying to be invasive.

908
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,060
 It's that she is actually invested.

909
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,560
 She cares about you.

910
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,320
 Like she doesn't need to know everything you're doing

911
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,500
 but she does want to know everything you're feeling

912
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,100
 because ladies have a tendency

913
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,440
 to have easier emotional chemistry with other people.

914
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,380
 You see, there's a major difference

915
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,940
 in falling in love with someone

916
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,680
 and falling in love with the idea of someone.

917
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,140
 And the distinction or difference

918
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,940
 is a lack of emotional availability.

919
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,260
 Like they can be the most incredible human being

920
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,860
 but are you the only one that opens up

921
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,420
 when things are going on in your life?

922
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,260
 Like you're willing to tell them

923
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,580
 like what went wrong at work

924
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,620
 or the difficult conversation that you just had

925
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,140
 or the troubles that you're facing,

926
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,960
 the insecurities you're dealing with.

927
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,660
 And they never have anything to offer in return.

928
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,900
 Or when something happens in their life,

929
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,380
 like when their work goes haywire

930
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,940
 or their relationships turn south

931
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,680
 or maybe you're in a disagreement,

932
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,340
 they pull away, they withdraw.

933
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,940
 They try to move back into the recesses away from engaging.

934
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,140
 That's not a healthy sign.

935
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,980
 How about this?

936
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,060
 Do they engage on topics that have nothing to do with them

937
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,060
 and everything to do with you?

938
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,400
 I remember I had to learn this one.

939
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,000
 This was not an easy one for me nor natural to me.

940
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,060
 But when Brooke would come home from work,

941
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,340
 I would have to not just listen

942
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,780
 to the things she was saying

943
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,420
 but I would have to ask questions

944
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,740
 so that way I would ensure I'm engaged

945
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,380
 and emotionally available for her.

946
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,640
 Guys, if you want to build emotional chemistry

947
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,700
 with a young lady,

948
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,380
 then you need to think

949
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,820
 about what it looks like to become

950
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,820
 emotionally present with her.

951
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,220
 And I need to make a quick caveat

952
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,820
 because this is only within the confines

953
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,500
 of someone you're seriously pursuing.

954
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,420
 A lot of damage has been done

955
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,380
 by both girls and guys

956
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,940
 that emotionally dump on someone else.

957
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,660
 Get them deeply invested.

958
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,420
 You have no intention of doing anything with them.

959
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,100
 If you're doing that, please stop.

960
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,540
 For the love of God, don't do that to people anymore.

961
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,700
 And yet if you're a guy in the room

962
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,020
 and you actually are pursuing a young lady,

963
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,540
 you want to build emotional chemistry,

964
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,760
 then what you need to do

965
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,420
 is you need to learn three very important words.

966
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
 You ready for them?

967
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
 Tell me more.

968
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,140
 That's it.

969
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
 Tell me more.

970
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,820
 'Cause if you do that, what's gonna happen

971
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,700
 is she's actually going to light up

972
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,620
 and tell you things about what's going on in her life.

973
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,740
 I remember someone looked at me and told me,

974
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,500
 "Hey, whenever something's going on in your wife's life,

975
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,180
 "those are windows into her soul,

976
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,180
 "so pay very close attention."

977
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,020
 And guess what?

978
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,940
 There are bonus points

979
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,820
 if you can take old information she's shared

980
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,660
 and you can connect it to new information she's sharing.

981
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
 She's gonna look at you and be like,

982
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,300
 "Oh my gosh, you're the most thoughtful man

983
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
 "I've ever met in my entire life."

984
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,020
 (audience laughing)

985
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,420
 Emotional chemistry matters.

986
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,020
 You want a relationship where that's true of you

987
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,620
 because you want someone who can support you.

988
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,260
 Like in the goals you have, in the trials you face,

989
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,580
 in the dreams you hold, in the hardships ahead,

990
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,060
 you want someone that is like Jesus

991
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,020
 because this is how he cares for you.

992
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,340
 Matthew 9, 36 says, "When he saw the crowds,

993
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,740
 "he had compassion for them

994
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,280
 "because they were harassed and helpless,

995
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,920
 "like sheep without a shepherd."

996
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,360
 Jesus sees not simply what's on the surface,

997
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,480
 he sees what's under the surface

998
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,580
 because Jesus sees straight to the heart.

999
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,900
 He wants to know what's really going on

1000
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,200
 because then he can really care for you.

1001
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,260
 We should do the same thing.

1002
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,500
 In closing, let me just say this.

1003
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,580
 I know as I unpack all of that,

1004
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,900
 some of you are sitting here and you're thinking,

1005
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,340
 "Kylen, we have all of that.

1006
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,380
 "Like in my relationship, that stuff is all true.

1007
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,260
 "We have social chemistry, like we're best friends.

1008
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,680
 "We've made some amazing memories.

1009
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,080
 "We laugh all the time.

1010
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,940
 "We have all the same mutual interests.

1011
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,720
 "We've got romantic chemistry.

1012
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,580
 "Like he flirts with me and we're playful together

1013
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,860
 "and I've got goosebumps and all the butterflies

1014
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,700
 "that should be true.

1015
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,520
 "And we have emotional chemistry.

1016
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,300
 "Like I never have to worry about where she stands.

1017
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,160
 "I always know where she is

1018
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,400
 "and she always knows where I am.

1019
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,200
 "And yet, Kylen, we've got all of that chemistry

1020
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,860
 "that you just unpacked.

1021
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,100
 "And yet something is still missing for me.

1022
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,320
 "Why, why is that the case?"

1023
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,840
 I have only one question to ask you.

1024
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,960
 Do they know Jesus?

1025
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,960
 Like, do they really know Jesus?

1026
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:14,760
 And that sounds like such the classic gospel turn

1027
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,960
 at the end of the message,

1028
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,520
 what should be proclaimed from this stage.

1029
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,680
 But I am so serious.

1030
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,400
 Do they know him?

1031
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,360
 Because the truth of the matter is,

1032
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,700
 you can have all of these three loves figured out.

1033
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,080
 But if you don't have the first and the foremost love,

1034
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,920
 then you don't have anything.

1035
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,260
 Our world has figured out chemistry,

1036
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,480
 but they have not figured out Christ.

1037
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,240
 They exist in relationships where they're great friends

1038
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,780
 and they do flirt and they find all the right feelings.

1039
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,980
 And yet they have no faith.

1040
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,520
 What ultimately binds a holy God to an unholy people

1041
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,680
 is not chemistry or compatibility,

1042
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,880
 for there was never a more incompatible couple

1043
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,800
 in all history.

1044
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,480
 It was commitment that he would sacrifice himself for us.

1045
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,360
 It's that first love, that agape love,

1046
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,500
 that love that is most characteristic of Christ.

1047
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,060
 Because when we, listen,

1048
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,400
 when we lacked friendship, phileo, with God,

1049
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,760
 he never lacked love for you.

1050
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,820
 When we lacked passion, eros for God,

1051
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,180
 he never lacked love for you.

1052
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,560
 When we lacked care,

1053
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,180
 storge for God,

1054
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,540
 he never lacked love for you.

1055
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,540
 Instead, he swept in to make you his friends.

1056
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,060
 He moved in and wooed you to himself.

1057
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,140
 And he has called you his family,

1058
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,580
 son, daughter, brother, sister,

1059
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,980
 because he has a love which the world knows not.

1060
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,360
 All other kinds of love will fail,

1061
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,200
 but the love of God,

1062
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,620
 the self-sacrificing love of Jesus

1063
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,900
 is a love that will never, nor has it ever,

1064
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,820
 failed.

1065
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,780
 (gentle music)

1066
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,900
 If you know him, you'll find them.

1067
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,360
 Let me pray you would.

1068
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:39,260
 God, you know that I have wrestled

1069
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,700
 with insecurity around this series

1070
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,900
 for the last half of it.

1071
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:51,300
 And yet, God, what I know is there's not a day go by,

1072
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,740
 nor a decision ever made

1073
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,700
 that is not first and foremost sovereignly

1074
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,060
 orchestrated by you.

1075
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,220
 And so, God, I believe,

1076
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,580
 God, I believe,

1077
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,140
 here at the end of it all,

1078
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,540
 on a message that may feel so very niche,

1079
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,620
 you can take it and multiply it to the masses,

1080
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,420
 and you can reach them, God.

1081
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,420
 These friends of mine here,

1082
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,280
 you can reach them right where they are,

1083
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,980
 whatever their condition or status.

1084
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:34,420
 And so, God, I'm praying you'd do it.

1085
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,860
 I'm praying right now

1086
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,840
 you would bring the dead to life,

1087
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,680
 'cause that's the story.

1088
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,660
 If you don't know Jesus, you're dead.

1089
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,540
 You're dead in your trespasses and sins,

1090
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,500
 and yet that's the good news.

1091
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,420
 The gospel, he stepped in,

1092
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,620
 so that way you would not have to have death

1093
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,220
 as the final chapter,

1094
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,940
 but instead you could have life

1095
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,720
 in a story that goes on forever.

1096
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,460
 All you have to do is

1097
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,060
 accept the free gift of salvation

1098
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,900
 by placing your faith and declaring him as Lord.

1099
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,900
 Others, you're here,

1100
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,900
 and there's another step for you to take.

1101
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,220
 Listen to the Spirit,

1102
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,700
 and then be responsive, obedient to your beloved.

1103
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,660
 If you need to pray with someone down

1104
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,500
 at the foot of the stage,

1105
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,220
 we're gonna be here for you,

1106
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,700
 but we're gonna respond in worship.

1107
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,140
 God, we love you.

1108
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,860
 We sing to you now.

1109
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,420
 It is in your name we pray, amen.

1110
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:40,420
