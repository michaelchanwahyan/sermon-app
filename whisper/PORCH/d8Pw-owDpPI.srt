00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,920
 All right.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,320
 Well, we are back in Exhale.

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
 Dallas, it's so good to see you guys tonight.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,040
 Hello, Fort Worth, Houston, and listening in

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,320
 from around the country.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,160
 If we've never met before, my name is Garrett.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,480
 And I normally spend my Tuesday nights

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,960
 at the porch in Fort Worth, just about 40 miles west.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,240
 And so it's good to be your guest tonight.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,880
 We're going to be back in the Psalms

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,120
 as well as we continue Exhale.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,520
 And so what I'll do is I'll read a selection of Psalm 51,

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
 where we'll be.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,400
 And then I'll pray one more time.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,000
 And then we'll see what God's got for us in that Psalm

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,480
 together.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,360
 So it says, "Have mercy on me, O God.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,120
 According to your unfailing love,

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
 according to your great compassion,

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,800
 blot out my transgressions.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,160
 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,600
 For I know my transgressions, and my sin

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,240
 is always before me.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,560
 Against you, you only, have I sinned.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,440
 Restore to me the joy of your salvation

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,120
 and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,200
 Then I will teach transgressors your ways,

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
 and sinners will turn back to you."

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,880
 Let's ask God for a little bit of help,

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,840
 and we'll go together.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,440
 God, I pray that as we get into your scripture tonight,

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,360
 that you would speak so clearly from it.

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,800
 We know that you didn't write it in vain.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,320
 You didn't write it so that we wouldn't read it.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,040
 And you didn't write it so that we would read it

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,960
 and not understand it.

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,040
 You wrote it so that we would read it,

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,920
 we would understand it,

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,640
 and it would transform us from the inside out.

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
 And so I pray that that's exactly what would happen

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,160
 as we gather tonight.

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,600
 In Jesus' name, amen.

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,320
 Well again, my name's Garrett,

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,720
 and I've been hanging out at Watermark

49
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,120
 for the last couple of years.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,480
 And I wanna tell you,

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,520
 have you ever noticed how shame can be worse

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
 than a sin itself?

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,720
 Like the shame that comes from a failure

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,520
 can be worse than the actual failure itself.

55
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
 Let me tell you what I mean.

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
 When I was brand new here,

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,440
 I had just started what was called a residency program,

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,720
 I think internship 2.0 kind of thing.

59
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,040
 And I had begun that here at Watermark.

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
 And in the first month, I mean,

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,440
 you're coming into that kind of thing,

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,400
 and you got all kinds of hopes,

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,320
 you got all kinds of dreams,

64
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,760
 and you're looking for the next adventure ahead,

65
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
 and it's gonna be so great and all that.

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,880
 Well, about a month into that,

67
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,920
 I end up at one of our elders' homes.

68
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,960
 And so you're like, what's an elder?

69
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
 Someone older than you?

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,840
 No, like one of the leaders of the church,

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
 like one of the leaders of the church,

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,040
 like bosses, bosses, bosses, bosses, boss kind of person.

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,280
 And so I ended up over there.

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,000
 He wasn't there, in fact, we'd hardly met,

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,560
 but he had just allowed us to use his backyard

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
 and had a pool.

77
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 It was a pretty nice backyard.

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,640
 And so I end up over there,

79
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,240
 and some things happened that should not have happened.

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,760
 And so like we climbed up on a brick pillar

81
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,680
 because we decided it would be a good idea

82
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,520
 to film like a trick basketball shot.

83
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,080
 Why would you do that in a home that you don't own

84
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,360
 when you have a new job and it's your boss's boss's boss?

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,760
 That's just not a good idea.

86
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
 But that's what we did.

87
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,440
 I turned my brain off and we decided to do that.

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
 And so then what do you know,

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,520
 a piece of that brick pillar fell onto the ground and broke.

90
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,360
 And when it did that,

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,960
 it was like almost a shatter kind of thing.

92
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
 It was pretty bad.

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
 And so we started to clean it up,

94
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,400
 and finally we did.

95
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,880
 And instead of like communicating

96
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,400
 that something had gone wrong, you know, like you do,

97
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,680
 instead of doing that,

98
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,200
 what we did was we just kind of put it back up there,

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,840
 like it was gonna be fine.

100
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,480
 And you mean you could just hardly tell,

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,280
 it was just like a little bit of a black eye, you know,

102
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
 I mean, it was just barely visible.

103
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,760
 Okay, who does that?

104
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,920
 Why would you do that?

105
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,640
 Extraordinarily not smart.

106
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,000
 And so a few days later, hours later, I should say,

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,520
 I get a phone call that he has discovered this

108
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,640
 and that he would like to meet with me.

109
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,680
 And we set a meeting for four days later.

110
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,240
 It was the worst four days of my life at Watermark,

111
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,120
 of my water life.

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,000
 It was the worst four days of my Watermark life.

113
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
 It was not good.

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,480
 And I was so, we got off the phone,

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,080
 and I was physically, I was sweating.

116
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,320
 I was terrified.

117
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,200
 I was so discouraged that I could not,

118
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
 I was ashamed of the fact that I hadn't told him.

119
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
 Not that I'd broken the brick, that I hadn't told him.

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,080
 I mean, who, what nine-year-old doesn't know,

121
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,760
 hey, if you break something, don't surprise people,

122
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,080
 let's communicate, you know, that kind of thing?

123
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,000
 And so I began four ashamed, miserable days.

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
 And I'm like seeing my future,

125
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,320
 instead of thinking possibility,

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,360
 I'm thinking survival.

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,000
 I'm thinking I'm about to get fired.

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,160
 Like my days are done.

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
 Like future conversation is,

130
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
 Garrett, how'd you get fired at Watermark?

131
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,280
 I broke the elder's house.

132
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
 That's, I'm gonna be the guy who got fired from Watermark

133
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,080
 because I broke the elder's house.

134
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
 That's gonna be the story here.

135
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,080
 And so for four days, I had like a stomach ache.

136
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,360
 I could barely eat and sleep.

137
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
 No exaggeration.

138
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,040
 You're like, Garrett, that sounds like a real shame problem.

139
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,320
 Caught me, that's what I'm telling you.

140
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
 It was a shame problem.

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,200
 And instead, I went into a meeting with him.

142
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,680
 And when I got there, he did not give me a swift firing,

143
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
 clearly.

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,120
 Instead, we had a conversation, not about failure,

145
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,320
 not about what had actually happened, see.

146
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
 But instead we had a conversation

147
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,200
 about how to respond after failure.

148
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,920
 Because isn't it understood

149
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,200
 that failure is just kind of part of life?

150
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
 I mean, you either just got out of a failure,

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,680
 you're in one now, or you got one around the corner.

152
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,160
 I mean, that's kind of the way human life works.

153
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,000
 I mean, if you're,

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,640
 this doesn't change when you become a Christian,

155
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
 by the way.

156
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
 I mean, this is like, it's just part of life.

157
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
 And what's needed most of the time,

158
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,720
 if you're type A, you're already leaning in.

159
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
 If you're a perfectionist,

160
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
 you're really dialed in already, right?

161
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,960
 Because what we need is we don't need failure avoidance.

162
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
 That's called perfectionism.

163
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,200
 You'll drive yourself crazy.

164
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,120
 I've tried it.

165
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,360
 What is needed typically, and for all of us at times,

166
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,480
 is a biblical response to failure,

167
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,360
 a biblical response to failure.

168
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,800
 Not where you look out the windshield

169
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,880
 and try to avoid the next failure,

170
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,160
 but where you look in the rear view mirror

171
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
 and see a failure

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,440
 and know how you're gonna respond on the inside.

173
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
 That's what's needed.

174
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,160
 And so what I'm gonna do tonight

175
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,640
 is I'm gonna talk about failure response.

176
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,800
 Not failure avoidance, but failure response.

177
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,880
 Sin response, mistake response, that kind of thing.

178
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
 But I'm gonna narrow it down.

179
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,480
 So before we go in any further,

180
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,320
 I am gonna talk about failure tonight,

181
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,160
 but I'm gonna talk about a particular kind.

182
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,880
 One little particular kind of sin,

183
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,040
 one little particular kind of failure

184
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,560
 that it just seems to be a little bit harder

185
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
 to rebound after.

186
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,520
 One particular kind of sin

187
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,280
 that you're probably less likely to bounce back fast after.

188
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,800
 One particular kind of shame

189
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
 that wants to just stick with you,

190
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,760
 that seems to hit you in a little bit of a deeper place.

191
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
 There's one particular kind of sin

192
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,440
 that Bible hero after Bible hero,

193
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,680
 some of you are named after them, fell into.

194
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,640
 And of this sin, which is no less forgivable

195
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
 than anything else,

196
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,400
 the scripture still says,

197
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,160
 "All other sins are outside the body.

198
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,720
 "But if you sin sexually,

199
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,000
 "you sin against your own body."

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,880
 It's in a unique class all its own

201
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,960
 and its ability to create shame inside you.

202
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
 That's the way sexual sin works.

203
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,680
 No less forgivable than anything else,

204
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
 by God or by other people.

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,160
 But all the same, uniquely powerful to create

206
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,440
 long-lasting, personality-changing,

207
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,840
 future-demolishing shame.

208
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,800
 Sexual sin can do that.

209
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
 Sexual failure can do that.

210
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,720
 So that's what I'm gonna talk about this evening.

211
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,200
 So if you're brand new, welcome to the porch.

212
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
 That's where we're going.

213
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,280
 (congregation laughing)

214
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,960
 And so that's a big claim, right?

215
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,160
 I mean, that sexual sin is uniquely powerful to create shame.

216
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 Where do I get away with saying that?

217
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,480
 Well, first, 1 Corinthians 6, 18,

218
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 which I just shared with you.

219
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
 Secondly, experience matches.

220
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
 And so I'm working in pastoral ministry.

221
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,640
 What happens is you spend a lot of time

222
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,880
 in conversations with peers,

223
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,600
 getting to know them and getting to know their walks

224
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
 with God and how they interact with the Bible

225
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
 and spiritual things and all of that.

226
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
 And so when you spend significant time

227
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,280
 in conversation with people,

228
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,440
 you start to notice some trends.

229
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,480
 Here's one trend.

230
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,280
 When someone says, "I've never told anyone this,

231
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,280
 "but I know what's gonna follow."

232
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,320
 Or when they look down and they're clearly ashamed

233
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,560
 and they say, "I've never really shared this with anyone

234
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,040
 "and I can't believe I'm even telling you,

235
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,040
 "but they're not about to tell me

236
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,480
 "that they stole grapes from the Walmart

237
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,440
 "when they were five.

238
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
 "They're about to tell me something

239
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,040
 "that they did sexually every time, and I'm no different."

240
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,000
 Every time someone says, "Hey, I gotta tell you something,

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
 "man, I'm gonna," and it's clear

242
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,760
 that shame is ruling the day.

243
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,160
 I know what's gonna follow every time.

244
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,400
 And it's that they've done something sexually

245
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,240
 that they're ashamed of,

246
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,120
 that's starting to mark their conscience.

247
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,080
 Shame from sexual sin can even make,

248
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,920
 are you ready for this?

249
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
 This is a huge claim.

250
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,520
 Sexual shame can even make a genuine believer in Christ

251
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,000
 so self-disappointed, so condemned,

252
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
 so guilty conscience-ridden

253
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,640
 that they abandon their own relationship

254
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,680
 with God altogether.

255
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,960
 So let me ask you a scary question

256
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,400
 before we get going and get into the scripture.

257
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,960
 Do you think it's possible

258
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,560
 for a genuine God-fearing, Jesus-following,

259
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,640
 Christ-exalting young adult in their 20s or 30s

260
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,320
 with high hopes for making their life all about God,

261
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,440
 is it possible for that person to sin sexually

262
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,800
 and become so discouraged by it

263
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,680
 that they spend the rest of their days on earth

264
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,000
 as a nominal Christian because they are plagued by self-doubt?

265
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,480
 Do you think that's possible?

266
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,520
 That a genuine Christ-following,

267
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,440
 how could that be, right?

268
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,360
 You wouldn't think so,

269
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,280
 but do you think it's possible

270
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,800
 for a genuine Christ-following, Jesus-loving,

271
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,880
 God-exalting person to sin sexually

272
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,040
 and become so self-condemned

273
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,640
 that they die as a nominal Christian

274
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,760
 with a Lexus and a lake house

275
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,160
 because that was second best?

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,880
 You bet that can happen.

277
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,600
 And I don't think it has to happen.

278
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,000
 I don't think it has to happen.

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
 I don't think the scripture wants it to happen.

280
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,960
 I don't think God wants it to happen.

281
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,880
 And I think Jesus died

282
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
 so that that doesn't have to happen to you.

283
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,240
 And so if you got a guilty conscience, okay,

284
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,560
 I wanna tell you, I'm talking to all the failures tonight,

285
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,160
 and I'm starting with me, and mine are many and ugly.

286
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,080
 So if you got a guilty conscience tonight,

287
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,400
 I'm not picking a fight with your sexual sin.

288
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,800
 I'm not doing that tonight.

289
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
 I'm not here to talk about your illicit sex

290
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,280
 or your recent porn browsing

291
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,360
 or the burning desire you have

292
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,120
 to take the clothes off the person you love.

293
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,360
 I'm not here to talk about the clothes off

294
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,200
 the person you're dating.

295
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,520
 I'm not here to talk about any of that.

296
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,240
 What I am here to talk about is how to respond

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,480
 to the fact that you're ashamed of those things.

298
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
 Because see what shame does

299
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
 is it takes that recent sexual encounter,

300
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
 and it takes that recent porn browsing,

301
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
 and it takes that desire

302
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
 that you wouldn't really wanna tell anybody about,

303
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,280
 and it takes that habit,

304
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
 you wouldn't wanna call it an addiction

305
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,200
 because after all, you could quit any time you want.

306
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,400
 But it takes that little habit that you have,

307
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
 and shame steps in and says, you see that?

308
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,080
 You'll never make a Christ follower out of yourself, ever.

309
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,520
 You think you're holy?

310
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,840
 You're filthy.

311
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,040
 That's what shame does.

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
 I'm gonna pick a fight with that.

313
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,000
 So here we go, Psalm 51.

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,400
 Psalm 51 is a song, and it's a prayer.

315
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
 And you wanna know who it's coming from, by the way.

316
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,160
 Anybody remember David?

317
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,720
 So if I said David and,

318
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,160
 you might finish the sentence with David and?

319
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,640
 Goliath, oh, I heard both of 'em.

320
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,200
 Okay, you might finish it with David and Goliath, right?

321
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
 And so that would be like the high moment.

322
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,440
 That'd be like the peak moment.

323
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,080
 That'd be like where David is the man,

324
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,400
 and everybody is cheering.

325
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,360
 But if I said David and, and you finished it again,

326
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,320
 you might say David and?

327
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,760
 Bathsheba, yeah, that'd be the valley.

328
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,800
 That'd be the low point.

329
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,160
 And so the Psalm tonight that we're gonna read

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
 is the way David prays after that event

331
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,160
 called David and Bathsheba.

332
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
 And so if you don't know what David and Bathsheba is,

333
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,160
 I wanna make sure we're all together tonight.

334
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,640
 David, it was, David is the king of Israel.

335
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,000
 He's like the most celebrated national hero

336
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,880
 in all of history, for the nation of Israel anyway.

337
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,160
 And he ascends to the highest of heights.

338
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,320
 He did kill Goliath when he was just a teenager,

339
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,560
 rendering him to be a massive hero

340
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,840
 in the eyes of the people.

341
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,320
 And then when he was actually ruling king,

342
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
 he slept with, and by slept with,

343
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,120
 I mean forcibly came onto a woman named Bathsheba

344
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,760
 who he did see bathing.

345
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,240
 It's not a play on words.

346
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
 But a woman who he did see bathing,

347
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,560
 who was named Bathsheba, forced himself upon her,

348
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,800
 called her to himself, had an affair with her,

349
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,000
 got her pregnant, tried to cover it up.

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
 And then when it couldn't be covered up,

351
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,720
 had her husband who was away at the battle lines

352
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
 fighting the battle that David should have been fighting,

353
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,720
 had him killed, okay?

354
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,400
 So we're talking about adultery and murder.

355
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,640
 That's what David committed.

356
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,040
 The golden boy, the man after God's own heart,

357
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,280
 that's what he did.

358
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,440
 And so let me just pause right there.

359
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,720
 And see, if you're not really a Bible person,

360
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,640
 and you're like, the Bible's boring,

361
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,600
 let me help you, the Bible's not boring.

362
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,520
 If you read this, the Bible's not boring.

363
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,880
 And so this is David at the pit

364
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,840
 and the bottom of his sexual sin, the worst.

365
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,800
 You know that guilty conscience thing that keeps happening?

366
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 That's where he is, and that's what he prays out of.

367
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,200
 And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna see

368
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,080
 that he prays what is consistent with God's truth.

369
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,640
 Even in this moment,

370
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,440
 he prays what's consistent with God's truth.

371
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,040
 And so what I want us to do as we go through Psalm 51

372
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,960
 is to pick out three statements.

373
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,000
 They come in order that will allow us

374
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,120
 to form a better response to our own sexual sin.

375
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,680
 So here we go, Psalm 51, one.

376
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,560
 Have mercy on me, O God.

377
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,280
 According to your unfailing love,

378
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,360
 according to your great compassion,

379
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,920
 blot out my transgressions.

380
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,880
 Just means sin.

381
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,520
 Wash away all my iniquity.

382
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,200
 Same thing.

383
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
 Cleanse me from my sin.

384
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
 Nothing surprising here, right?

385
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,560
 Just begging forgiveness.

386
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,560
 And then he says, for I know my transgressions.

387
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,320
 I'll tell you why that's important in just a second.

388
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,880
 For I know my transgressions,

389
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,080
 and my sin is always before me.

390
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,920
 You hear him?

391
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,400
 He's got that low light reel going, you know?

392
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,920
 The moment that seems so enticing,

393
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,880
 the moment he imagined, the moment that he wanted,

394
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,760
 and then after it became a reality,

395
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,160
 it was the grossest thing in his mind

396
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
 and he couldn't shake it.

397
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,560
 My sin's always before me.

398
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,840
 But he says just before that, in verse three,

399
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,320
 he says, I know my transgressions.

400
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,800
 And when he says, I know my transgressions,

401
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,920
 he doesn't just mean that he's aware

402
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,200
 in a general sense of the fact that he's a sinner.

403
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,120
 He means that he knows exactly what he's done.

404
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
 And more than that,

405
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,920
 he knows that God knows exactly what he's done.

406
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
 This is a prayer, right?

407
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,400
 And so he knows that God knows exactly what he's done.

408
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,680
 Furthermore, the person who came to him,

409
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,240
 the way that he became convinced

410
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,520
 in his spirit about what he had just done

411
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,560
 is that a human being actually came to him,

412
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,080
 his name was Nathan, the prophet,

413
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,200
 came to him and convicted him of his sin,

414
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,760
 shared with him, hey, this isn't just known

415
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,160
 by you and God, buddy, sorry.

416
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,520
 The people know, we know.

417
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,240
 And so David, when he says, I know my transgressions,

418
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,920
 it's more than just, God, I'm a sinner.

419
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,000
 He's saying, God, I know what I've done,

420
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
 you know what I've done,

421
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
 and the people who are pertinent to this conversation,

422
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,840
 they know exactly what's happened here.

423
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,040
 And so what we need to do is not just say,

424
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,240
 I know I'm a sinner, we need to say, my sins are known.

425
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720
 My sins are known.

426
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,480
 And so my first point tonight is that

427
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,200
 we need to acknowledge our sin fully.

428
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,760
 Phrase is the way you'll see it on the screen.

429
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,080
 Acknowledge your sin fully.

430
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,320
 You got a guilty conscience?

431
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,360
 You hurt by what you did or what,

432
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,200
 by what somebody did to you?

433
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,680
 Acknowledge the sin fully.

434
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,120
 I think that's so powerful

435
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,160
 because David's not being vague.

436
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,080
 And he's not in denial.

437
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,880
 Isn't that kind of a first fight or flight response

438
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,280
 whenever we're not happy with ourselves?

439
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,560
 David doesn't say, oh, this couldn't have been me.

440
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,080
 I was never gonna be this person.

441
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,000
 We're just gonna pretend like that's not part of my story.

442
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,480
 He doesn't do that.

443
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
 He's not in denial and he's not being vague.

444
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,120
 Which is more than I can say, and I'll be brave,

445
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
 that's more than I can say for most accountability

446
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,640
 amongst single Christians, honestly.

447
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,960
 That he is completely open, completely known,

448
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,440
 completely explicit and specific about what's going on.

449
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,760
 And he's open to that.

450
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,200
 Let me tell you why I say that.

451
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
 Isn't it true that we kind of,

452
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,840
 don't we hide behind our words when it's time to confess?

453
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,320
 Don't we like, we've created like this whole language

454
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,520
 around confession of sexual sin

455
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,760
 that doesn't even mean anything.

456
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,080
 Let me tell you what I mean.

457
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,920
 I fell.

458
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,880
 You're like, you fell down?

459
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,720
 What do you mean?

460
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,040
 [congregation laughing]

461
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,880
 You fell down?

462
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,720
 Like, where were you walking, man?

463
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,640
 Like, I don't wanna walk there.

464
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,160
 Oh, I slipped.

465
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,280
 You slipped?

466
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,080
 Like ice was on the ground?

467
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,920
 Like, what do you mean you slipped?

468
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,760
 I stumbled.

469
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,480
 Nobody can walk around here, this is weird.

470
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
 [congregation laughing]

471
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,200
 This is the clumsiest community group I have ever seen.

472
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,240
 Somebody needs to help these people.

473
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
 Okay.

474
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,120
 All right, I'm just gonna say this,

475
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,960
 you're all thinking it.

476
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,400
 Since when did I fell become code for I masturbated?

477
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,240
 That's not what that means.

478
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,840
 If that's what you need to say,

479
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,440
 that's what you should say.

480
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
 Right?

481
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
 Why would we hide behind our words?

482
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,520
 Like, why would we play games with each other?

483
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,800
 Why would we not acknowledge our sins fully?

484
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,640
 That's what we see in the scripture

485
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,720
 all over the place, right?

486
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,760
 Psalm 51's not enough.

487
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,600
 How about 1 John 1?

488
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
 If we walk in the light, it's he's in the light.

489
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,440
 He's faithful and just to forgive us.

490
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,040
 We have fellowship with one another.

491
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,160
 But if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.

492
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,320
 The truth's not in us.

493
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,920
 Acknowledge your sin fully, completely.

494
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,960
 Imagine for a second you needed to go to the doctor, okay?

495
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,080
 You had something wrong with you,

496
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,200
 something really clear.

497
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,240
 You know exactly what it is.

498
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,080
 It's bothering you.

499
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,400
 I mean, you don't go to the doctor on a whim.

500
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,240
 I mean, you gotta have something

501
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,640
 that you know is bothering you.

502
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,680
 And so you go to the doctor

503
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,280
 and you go through the whole rigmarole

504
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,320
 that's involved to actually get to see the guy.

505
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,040
 And you know, you go in, you make an appointment,

506
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,520
 you give the insurance information

507
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
 and every other thing about you

508
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,440
 that someone could possibly need to know.

509
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
 It's like, why am I filling out my dental records

510
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,000
 when I'm here at an, just, it's weird.

511
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,600
 And so there's so much information

512
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,760
 that needs to be handed to the doctor.

513
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
 And finally, you go through it

514
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,600
 and you go through three nurses.

515
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,840
 And finally, after 45 minutes, the doctor comes in

516
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,200
 and you know exactly what's wrong with you.

517
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,640
 And finally, he comes in and he says,

518
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
 "Hey, what's wrong?"

519
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,040
 And you say, "Well, I'm just not doing well."

520
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,760
 (congregation laughing)

521
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,320
 It's like, I gathered, you're in my office.

522
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,080
 Can you be a little more specific?

523
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,520
 "Well, you know, I'm just, I'm hurting."

524
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,160
 (congregation laughing)

525
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,720
 Okay, how about, can you like, can you show me where?

526
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,760
 "Well, I don't really wanna glorify it

527
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,080
 "by talking about it."

528
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,480
 (congregation laughing)

529
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,600
 I mean, so, do you, I mean, do you want help?

530
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
 I mean, do you, like, I'm here to help you.

531
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
 Do you really want help?

532
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,680
 The answer is, man, if you're talking like that, you don't.

533
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,720
 I promise you don't.

534
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,480
 Here's what you do when you're hurting and you want help.

535
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,680
 You walk in and you say, "Hey, I've got some lower back pain.

536
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,720
 "It's really aching me, and I've got some nerve pain

537
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,080
 "because of it that's going down my left leg,

538
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,600
 "so I'm having reduced mobility."

539
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
 And you can put any machine on me you want,

540
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,760
 X-ray, MRI, I'd rather not pay, but I know I got to

541
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
 'cause I need to get the care that I need.

542
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,520
 And so, I'll point, like, I'll show you the spot.

543
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,840
 I mean, the doctor's going like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

544
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,000
 "don't show yet."

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,320
 And so, you're like, "Hey, let me show you where it hurts."

546
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,680
 Okay?

547
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,080
 And so, if you want help, if you want help,

548
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,240
 then you're gonna have to point to where it hurts.

549
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,560
 And so, if you've got a bruised conscience,

550
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,920
 and I know that's the last thing.

551
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,160
 If you have a bruised conscience, I've walked through this.

552
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,680
 If you have a bruised conscience from sexual sin,

553
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,280
 from a sexual past, the last thing you want

554
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,480
 is to bring another person in and say, "Hey, look at that."

555
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 Of course you don't wanna do that.

556
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,360
 It's not, not, not easy, but it's simple,

557
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,400
 and it's necessary, right?

558
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,560
 Acknowledge your sin fully.

559
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,120
 Let's go back to the text, verse four.

560
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,440
 "Against you, you only have I sinned

561
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,800
 "and done what is evil in your sight."

562
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
 Which is a little confusing, right?

563
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,960
 Against you only?

564
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,840
 It feels like you just had an affair with somebody

565
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,760
 and then killed her husband.

566
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,840
 That feels like you sinned against more people than God.

567
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,960
 And so, when he says, "You only,"

568
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
 he doesn't mean exclusively, right?

569
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,280
 He means especially.

570
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,440
 This is superlative language, hyperbole, if you will,

571
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,480
 not literal.

572
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,240
 "Against you, you only, especially you, God,

573
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,160
 "have I sinned and done what's evil in your sight."

574
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,520
 So you're right in your verdict,

575
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,800
 and you're justified when you judge.

576
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,760
 God, if you judge me, you're right.

577
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,160
 I don't just feel guilty, I am guilty, God.

578
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,000
 And then he starts to contrast himself with God.

579
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,160
 Do you hear that?

580
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,600
 "Surely I was sinful at birth."

581
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,640
 "Sinful from the time my mother conceived me,

582
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,960
 "yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb."

583
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,640
 You taught me wisdom in that secret place.

584
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,040
 Meaning, God, you've always been wise.

585
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,880
 I've always been prone to folly, always.

586
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,880
 You made a wisdom available to me from day one.

587
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
 I always chose ignorance.

588
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,800
 He's being honest, right?

589
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,480
 And he's contrasting himself with God,

590
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,360
 and he realizes there's a huge gap.

591
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,880
 And so he acknowledges it sinfully,

592
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,440
 and here comes a key transition.

593
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
 He starts now to make requests.

594
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,800
 Pay attention with me to what he actually asks for.

595
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
 He's gonna make six requests,

596
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,000
 and the sixth one's gonna be a summary

597
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
 of the previous five, verse seven.

598
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,120
 "Cleanse me with hyssop,"

599
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,480
 which is a branch they use to clean things.

600
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,840
 You can read about it in Leviticus if you want to,

601
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,680
 Leviticus 14.

602
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,360
 "Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean.

603
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,760
 "Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.

604
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,680
 "Let me hear joy and gladness.

605
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,960
 "Let the bones you have crushed rejoice.

606
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,000
 "Hide your face from my sins.

607
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,240
 "Blot out all my iniquity.

608
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,640
 "Create in me."

609
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,680
 Create in me a pure heart, God.

610
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,040
 Renew a steadfast spirit within me.

611
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,160
 "Do not cast me from your presence,

612
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,920
 "or take your Holy Spirit from me.

613
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
 "Restore to me."

614
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,760
 Here's your summary,

615
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,440
 so if you wanna circle the second statement tonight,

616
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,960
 underneath verse three is verse 12.

617
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,080
 "Restore to me the joy of your salvation.

618
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,560
 "Restore to me the joy of your salvation,

619
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,200
 "and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me."

620
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,040
 He says, "Restore to me the joy of your salvation."

621
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,560
 The word choice is important,

622
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,160
 and the word order is important.

623
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,200
 You know, let's think for a second

624
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,240
 about what he didn't pray for.

625
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,800
 He never prayed in any of those six petitions,

626
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,280
 those six requests, those six asks.

627
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,160
 He didn't pray ever for his behavior to be curbed.

628
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,720
 Not one time.

629
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,560
 He did not say,

630
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,760
 "God, will you please never help,

631
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,760
 "will you help me to never do that again, God, ever?"

632
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,320
 It's not a bad prayer, it's just not what he prayed.

633
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,240
 "God, will you please help the direction of my life,

634
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,440
 "help me not to walk that direction,

635
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,760
 "help me not to walk that direction."

636
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,720
 He doesn't pray anything behavioral at all.

637
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,480
 He prays about the internal person.

638
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,720
 Do you see that?

639
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,160
 He says, "Give me a clean heart,

640
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,500
 "give me joy and gladness.

641
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,360
 "Restore to me the joy of your salvation."

642
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,480
 That really matters,

643
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,640
 because if you spend your whole life with God

644
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,080
 trying to curb your own behavior

645
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,900
 and not ever dealing with the desire

646
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,480
 that's driving the behavior,

647
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,660
 you're gonna drive yourself crazy.

648
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,260
 And it doesn't work, by the way.

649
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,940
 And so David doesn't go to God and say,

650
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,740
 "God, will you please help me to not,

651
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,220
 "next time I see a woman bathing, God,

652
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,540
 "will you please help me not have an affair with her

653
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,380
 "and kill her husband?"

654
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,860
 Like, got it.

655
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,300
 That's not the kind of things that he's praying.

656
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,320
 He's saying, "God, will you make David,

657
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,160
 "will you make the man on the outside

658
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,420
 "match the man on the inside?

659
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,500
 "Will you make the man on the inside

660
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,320
 "match the man you want him to be?

661
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,540
 "Will you create in me, God, a delight?

662
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,300
 "Will you create in me a delight in your salvation?"

663
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,340
 And so he doesn't pray for his own behavior to be curbed,

664
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,500
 he prays that internally he would delight in God

665
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,580
 because delight is gonna determine direction.

666
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,900
 Belief is going to drive behavior.

667
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,740
 And so he doesn't focus on the latter or the outside,

668
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,700
 he focuses on the inside.

669
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
 "God, will you make me new on the inside?

670
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,420
 "Because I know the behavior will take care of itself

671
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,260
 "when you do that.

672
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,980
 "And when you make me new on the inside,

673
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,700
 "when you give me a right spirit,

674
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,020
 "when you create in me a clean heart, oh God,

675
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,660
 "what's gonna happen is I'll look at sin,

676
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
 "I'll look at sin like at it,

677
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,440
 "like it's the disgusting trap that it is.

678
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,640
 "I'll see it for what it is, I'll recognize it.

679
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,100
 "So create in me, God, a clean heart, a pure heart."

680
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,260
 So that's the first observation

681
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,820
 from asking for the joy of salvation

682
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,620
 is he's not asking for behavioral change,

683
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,940
 he's asking for internal change

684
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,620
 that will then overflow inevitably into behavior.

685
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,620
 And secondly, he doesn't say, look at verse 12,

686
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,300
 "It doesn't say, 'Restore to me salvation.'"

687
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,300
 It doesn't say, "God, make me your son again.

688
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,220
 "God, make me your follower again.

689
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,620
 "God, let me back into your family, please, please, please."

690
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,460
 It doesn't say that.

691
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,940
 He assumes that he still has salvation.

692
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,020
 You see that?

693
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,940
 He assumes that his relationship with God

694
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,120
 has not disappeared.

695
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,860
 He assumes that he is still beloved by God

696
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,140
 and that at some future date,

697
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,220
 God is gonna preserve him in such a way

698
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,500
 as to bring him through trial and through judgment

699
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,220
 and act favorably towards him,

700
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,380
 even at David's lowest, darkest moment,

701
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,460
 even after his worst moments

702
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,220
 that everybody would rather forget.

703
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,460
 He is 100% confident that God is still the savior

704
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,020
 and preserver of his life and always will be.

705
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,160
 "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me

706
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,100
 "all the days of my life,

707
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,320
 "and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

708
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,920
 The same guy wrote those words.

709
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,140
 And so he didn't freak out after sin

710
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,420
 and think that he's not saved.

711
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,300
 That's not what happened.

712
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,140
 Instead, he's confident in the grace of God.

713
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,500
 He's confident that he is trusting God

714
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,700
 and he knows that God will bring him through.

715
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,340
 So he says, "Instead, restore to me

716
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,500
 "the joy of your salvation,

717
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,340
 "not restore to me salvation."

718
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,160
 What's that mean?

719
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,900
 It means that after you've sinned sexually,

720
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
 here's a prayer you can take right out of your journal

721
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,580
 and throw it away and put it in the trash can

722
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,560
 and never pray it again.

723
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,760
 "God, will you let me be a Christian again?"

724
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,540
 You never have to pray that.

725
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,180
 If you're a believer in Christ already,

726
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,540
 you've trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,

727
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,060
 you know that there's a God in heaven

728
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,740
 who is really real, he really loves you,

729
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,980
 he really sent his son to die

730
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,340
 and pay for all of your sins,

731
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,780
 sexual and otherwise,

732
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,340
 and that by trusting in him, you can be secure forever.

733
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,100
 Like if you're there and you believe that

734
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,420
 and then you sin sexually, guess what?

735
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,980
 You didn't undo.

736
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,620
 You didn't undo what God's done.

737
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,020
 Salvation is God's work and you can't undo it.

738
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,940
 There's nothing you can do to make God love you anymore.

739
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,740
 Nothing you can do to make him love you any less.

740
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,040
 No behavior that you can take.

741
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,980
 If you have trusted in Christ

742
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

743
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,460
 there's not a single thing you can do

744
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,040
 to take yourself out of his hand.

745
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,060
 David knows that and he prays,

746
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,060
 therefore, out of a relationship with God,

747
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,900
 not for a relationship with God, out of one.

748
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,020
 That's a huge distinction.

749
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,700
 So the second point tonight,

750
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,460
 if you're looking for what to do after sexual sin

751
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,480
 is simply ask for the joy of salvation.

752
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,300
 Ask for the joy of salvation.

753
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,780
 Ask to be delighted.

754
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,660
 Ask God if he'll help you be delighted

755
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,660
 by the fact that he has never given up on you.

756
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,380
 Ask God to remind you of the fact that he's still for you.

757
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,620
 Ask God to remind you of the fact

758
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,180
 that you're still his child and Christ still died for you

759
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,140
 and that, by the way, when Christ died,

760
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,620
 all of your sins were still future

761
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,020
 and so your future sins aren't gonna mess

762
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,500
 with anything that he's done for you.

763
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,060
 And so why don't you ask him to remind you of those things

764
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,580
 and make you happy about it?

765
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,520
 There's a response.

766
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,380
 And this is where David's nerve gets unbelievable.

767
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,540
 I love this next verse.

768
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,440
 It's my favorite verse in the Psalm.

769
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,660
 I cannot believe the nerve

770
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,280
 that he comes with right out of this.

771
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,260
 He's just sinned.

772
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,540
 He acknowledges the sin fully.

773
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,580
 He asks for the delight in God and the salvation of God.

774
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,580
 And then in verse 13, he says these words.

775
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,680
 Then I will teach.

776
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,100
 Then I'll teach?

777
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,380
 Yeah, then I'll teach.

778
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,060
 It's like, wait, don't you mean then you'll humbly beg

779
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,740
 for the husband of the wife that you stole?

780
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,300
 Doesn't it mean you'll beg for his boys

781
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,640
 not to come kill you?

782
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,300
 I mean, doesn't it mean you'll lay low for a while?

783
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,660
 No, no, no, that's not what I mean.

784
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,280
 What I mean is then I'll teach, then I'll lead,

785
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,620
 then I'll talk, then I'll share,

786
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,680
 then I'll continue to do what God wanted me to do all along.

787
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,100
 Then I'll teach.

788
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,940
 Let's finish this sentence.

789
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,900
 Then I will teach transgressors your ways

790
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,340
 so that sinners will turn back to you.

791
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,100
 What a huge idea.

792
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,540
 Then I will teach transgressors your ways.

793
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,340
 You know, transgressors, the ones like me.

794
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,500
 Then I will teach them your ways so that sinners,

795
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,120
 this is gonna have an effect on other people.

796
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,380
 Do you see that?

797
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,620
 David is convinced that his story,

798
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,940
 including the last, most recent, embarrassing chapter

799
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,220
 is gonna be used by God

800
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,180
 and that it's gonna come through David's mouth.

801
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,100
 He believes that even the grossest of sins,

802
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,960
 even the most recent, even the most embarrassing,

803
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,780
 even the dirtiest, everything that's happened to this point,

804
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,980
 David is convinced that he is still going

805
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,980
 to have his story used by God.

806
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,820
 He knows it.

807
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,640
 That's why he says,

808
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,780
 "Then I'll teach transgressors your ways."

809
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,580
 And then he's confident of the effect of it.

810
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,060
 Other people are gonna be strengthened by it.

811
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,140
 Then other sinners will turn back to you.

812
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,980
 That's shocking.

813
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,260
 Imagine if a pastor was found out,

814
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,740
 that he was, think of a big name pastor, right?

815
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,000
 And it was found out that he was having

816
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,500
 an adulterous affair.

817
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,540
 And then in his press release, he said,

818
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,940
 "Yeah, and then in my sermon on Sunday,

819
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,380
 "I'm gonna talk about."

820
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,400
 It's like, hey, buddy,

821
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,340
 I don't think you need to be planning your next sermon.

822
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,640
 I think you need to be giving up platforms,

823
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,040
 not trying to hang onto one.

824
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,660
 But for David, he's so convinced of a relationship with God,

825
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,780
 so convinced of a relationship with God,

826
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,300
 that whether he's getting to speak to 80 or 8,000,

827
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,740
 he's gonna tell his story

828
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,820
 of the way God redeemed his life from the pit,

829
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,020
 even though there was sin to be acknowledged,

830
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,380
 God restored to him the joy of salvation,

831
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,660
 and now I'm gonna talk about that.

832
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,980
 David just does not believe the lies we believe after sin.

833
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,960
 That's what's happening here.

834
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,780
 David does not, you ever heard a lie

835
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,620
 in your own mind after you've sinned?

836
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,860
 Let me show you some of them.

837
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,920
 Here's some mourning after shame lies

838
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,180
 that come into our mind

839
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,900
 in a Psalm 51 truth to combat it.

840
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,260
 Okay, how about this lie?

841
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,620
 Number one, religious ritual will get me back to God.

842
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,580
 You ever felt that?

843
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,640
 Oh, I've sinned, you know, church three times,

844
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,380
 nine Hail Marys, I'll be all right.

845
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,660
 That's nowhere in Psalm 51.

846
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,580
 Instead, if I'm reading Psalm 51 right,

847
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,980
 it means God doesn't want sacrifices,

848
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,260
 he wants a humble and lowly spirit,

849
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,500
 as we'll see in just a moment.

850
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,740
 If you read down, that's what it says,

851
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,260
 he wants a humble and lowly spirit.

852
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,380
 He doesn't want sacrifices,

853
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,820
 he doesn't want you to religiously ritual

854
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,060
 your way back to God.

855
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,060
 How about this one?

856
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,880
 He's looking for perfection.

857
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,300
 No, he's not, he's looking for devotion.

858
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,740
 I'll go do church like nothing is wrong.

859
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,700
 There's a good idea.

860
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,380
 Don't go do church like nothing's wrong.

861
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,100
 Admit everything is wrong and then ask for help.

862
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,940
 Acknowledge, right?

863
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,100
 I need to make promises to God.

864
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,020
 You ever felt that way?

865
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,460
 You wake up, you're like, oh man, okay,

866
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,700
 what in the world can I tell God

867
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,660
 to make sure that we're on the same page again?

868
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,900
 Like he can't hear what you're thinking.

869
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,580
 Like you're gonna have a meeting with yourself

870
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,740
 and then you're gonna go back to God

871
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,740
 and y'all are gonna figure it out

872
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,980
 and you're really gonna give him the sales pitch

873
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,820
 on this one.

874
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,640
 That's not gonna happen.

875
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,680
 (laughing)

876
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
 I need a self-improved heart.

877
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,160
 I need to just go away for a while,

878
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,760
 I'll improve myself and then I'll come back to God.

879
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,480
 No, God wants a broken heart.

880
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,560
 That's what the Psalm says if you look down.

881
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,480
 How about this one?

882
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,300
 God's done with me.

883
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,480
 You ever heard that one?

884
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
 God's done with you.

885
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,480
 He's done.

886
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
 He's done with you.

887
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,140
 This is not the last time.

888
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,280
 The last time was the last time.

889
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,400
 You get no more last times.

890
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
 You're done, right?

891
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,240
 He's never gonna ease your guilty conscience.

892
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,900
 He's never gonna ease the earthly consequences of your sin.

893
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,100
 It's just your future's just out there waiting for you

894
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,760
 like a minefield and you're gonna have to walk through it

895
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,240
 and it's gonna blow up when you get there.

896
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
 God's done with you.

897
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
 You ever heard that?

898
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,360
 David's not convinced of that.

899
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,840
 That's not what Psalm 51 says.

900
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
 Instead, it says God's gonna use me.

901
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,860
 Then I'll teach transgressors.

902
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,700
 That's what that means.

903
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,780
 Restore to me the joy of your salvation.

904
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,360
 Then I'm gonna open my mouth from the rooftops

905
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,760
 and I'm gonna talk about what you've done for me, God.

906
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,120
 He's not buying the lie.

907
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,280
 I hate myself for what I did.

908
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,120
 You ever felt that way?

909
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,480
 You ever looked at something you didn't wanna look at?

910
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,600
 Touched something you didn't need to touch?

911
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,520
 And then afterward you feel like,

912
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,300
 I hate myself for what I did.

913
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,100
 I cannot believe what I just did.

914
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,040
 I don't even wanna look at me.

915
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,060
 No one else needs to look at me.

916
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,540
 I don't even wanna look at me.

917
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,380
 I hate myself.

918
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,940
 God loves you despite what you just did.

919
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,060
 There's a truth.

920
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,820
 God loves you despite what you just did,

921
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,740
 whether recent or a decade ago.

922
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,460
 I can't tell people about this.

923
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,820
 Gotta go hush.

924
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,100
 Gotta go quiet.

925
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,300
 I could never tell anybody about this.

926
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,140
 It's too embarrassing.

927
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,960
 It's too dark.

928
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,800
 It's too nasty.

929
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,640
 It's too bad.

930
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,460
 It's too, it's too, it's too.

931
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
 David doesn't do that.

932
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,340
 He doesn't think that.

933
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,440
 He assumes that after,

934
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,920
 and only after he's acknowledged sin for what it is,

935
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,060
 and only after God's upheld him with a willing spirit,

936
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,560
 then he'll open his mouth.

937
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,980
 He assumes that he's gonna tell.

938
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,500
 He assumes that.

939
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,340
 Amazing.

940
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,180
 And so what do you do?

941
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,640
 There's one, two, three, right?

942
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,060
 It wasn't given to us in one, two, three form.

943
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,580
 This is a poem, right?

944
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,660
 It's poetry.

945
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,180
 But there's a very clear one, two, three

946
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,220
 about what to do in response to a plagued conscience

947
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,340
 because of sexual sin.

948
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,820
 One, acknowledge your sin fully before yourself,

949
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,020
 before God, and before the appropriate other people.

950
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,780
 Two, ask for the joy of salvation.

951
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,500
 If you don't know what salvation is,

952
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,460
 if you haven't yet begun a relationship with Christ,

953
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,560
 what that means is, as I explained just a moment ago,

954
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,980
 it means that believing that there is a God,

955
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,060
 that he's real, that he loves you,

956
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,200
 that he sent his son to die,

957
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,300
 to take care of all of the sins in your place

958
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,540
 that you should have died for,

959
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,620
 instead dying the death you deserve,

960
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,900
 and that by faith in him, by faith in him,

961
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,280
 by trust in him alone, you can receive forgiveness

962
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,500
 and guaranteed salvation,

963
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,540
 that you can ask for joy in response to.

964
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,780
 Acknowledge your sin fully,

965
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,340
 then ask for the joy of salvation in your life.

966
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,820
 And then thirdly, allow God to use your story.

967
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,460
 Why wouldn't you allow God to use your story?

968
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,540
 I know what it's like to hate your story, by the way.

969
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,380
 I used to hate mine.

970
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,260
 And then I realized hating my own story

971
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,420
 is like looking down at my left hand

972
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,860
 and hating my own left hand,

973
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,140
 and thinking, man, I really wish God

974
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,420
 would've given me another one of those.

975
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,500
 That doesn't work, what a waste of time, right?

976
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,900
 Instead, David says, in this order,

977
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,740
 I'm gonna acknowledge sin,

978
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,340
 I'm gonna ask for the joy of salvation,

979
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,260
 and then I'm gonna act boldly.

980
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,900
 I'm gonna allow God to use my story.

981
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
 Now, if you skip one of those steps,

982
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,060
 you're gonna wind up in trouble.

983
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,900
 Why?

984
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,180
 Because if you skip to, oh, I'm just gonna talk,

985
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,020
 I'm gonna tell my story,

986
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,040
 and you do that before you acknowledge your sin fully,

987
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,900
 what's gonna happen is, you're gonna be fake

988
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,140
 and you're gonna be flippant.

989
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,520
 You're gonna be the person who commits serious sin,

990
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,660
 and then you wake up the next morning,

991
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,740
 and you go, oh, there's grace for that.

992
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,660
 Don't be that person, okay?

993
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,980
 If it's sin, call it sin.

994
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,140
 Look it in the face, right?

995
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,500
 And if you skip the second step,

996
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,020
 ask for the joy of salvation,

997
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,860
 what's gonna happen is,

998
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,940
 on the opposite end of the spectrum,

999
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,700
 if you skip the, God, will you restore

1000
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,620
 a right spirit within me,

1001
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,460
 what's gonna happen is,

1002
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,380
 you're gonna be downtrodden and guilty,

1003
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,940
 and you'll never get out

1004
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,140
 if you don't ask God for the joy of salvation.

1005
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,620
 And so then, and only then,

1006
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,320
 to whatever people that God's given you to speak to,

1007
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,100
 tell 'em, tell 'em what God did for you.

1008
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,560
 Tell 'em what God saved you from,

1009
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,640
 which, by the way, you can't do

1010
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,440
 unless you talk about where you were.

1011
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,600
 Tell it, share it, be strengthened.

1012
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,440
 Do you know, it says,

1013
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,120
 "Then I'll teach transgressors your ways,

1014
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,200
 "and sinners will come back to you."

1015
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,000
 Your story, whatever it is,

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
 it does not matter what it is,

1017
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
 and I know the temptation here

1018
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,080
 is to think that you're terminally unique.

1019
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,000
 It's like, I'm the only one of my kind in this room.

1020
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,840
 Let me help you.

1021
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,280
 You're not the only one of your kind in this room.

1022
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,200
 And God will use your story, just like the rest,

1023
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,080
 to encourage the people to your left and to your right.

1024
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,440
 And so, whoever God's given you an audience with,

1025
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,720
 whoever God's given you an audience with, be ready.

1026
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,920
 If you've been strengthened

1027
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,480
 by the provision that he's made for you

1028
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,840
 in the cross, in Christ,

1029
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,160
 if you've been strengthened by that,

1030
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,360
 and you're ready to acknowledge what he's done for you,

1031
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
 which, by the way, entails you acknowledging

1032
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,480
 where you were apart from him,

1033
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,560
 if you're ready to do that,

1034
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,960
 why don't you tell some people

1035
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,920
 about what God's done for you

1036
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,220
 so that he can get the praise for what he did?

1037
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,660
 And sinners will come back to him.

1038
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,420
 The people around you will respond.

1039
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,980
 Let me close by sharing some ways that,

1040
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,500
 one particular way, a key conversation in my life,

1041
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,020
 where this actually happened to me.

1042
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,380
 About a year, nearly a year,

1043
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,660
 into working here at Watermark,

1044
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,340
 I was still a resident at the time.

1045
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,100
 I was traveling with JP, who,

1046
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,700
 if it's your first night here tonight,

1047
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,240
 he directs the porch, and I was traveling with him.

1048
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,540
 He was speaking at a Christian camp.

1049
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,580
 I was not speaking at the camp.

1050
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,820
 I was carrying the bags and trying to tell a joke or two.

1051
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,420
 And so, while we were there,

1052
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,060
 we were just hanging out, and I woke up one morning,

1053
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,420
 and I had what Psalm 51, one and two

1054
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,300
 describe in the guilty conscience of a person

1055
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,840
 who has just sinned terribly.

1056
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,940
 So my own past was pornography, sex, drugs, and alcohol.

1057
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,640
 I was exposed to all that before I was 16 years old.

1058
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,100
 Went through a porn addiction when I was in college.

1059
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,520
 Partied, all of it.

1060
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,580
 Was creative about it.

1061
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,500
 And I woke up one morning while we were at this,

1062
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,380
 we were at this Christian camp,

1063
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,860
 and I woke up one morning, and I looked out the window,

1064
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,300
 and I thought, this is, what am I doing here?

1065
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,780
 Like, why do I belong here?

1066
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,620
 I don't belong here.

1067
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,100
 This is a place where God's people

1068
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,260
 come to do God's business.

1069
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,020
 I'm not God's man.

1070
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,520
 How did I sneak into this?

1071
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,620
 And then JP, I wake up, and I see him over there,

1072
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,820
 and I go, I'm thinking, this guy interviewed me

1073
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,180
 and gave me a shot.

1074
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,860
 Like, he gave me a chance.

1075
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,420
 Like, he's gonna wonder, like,

1076
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,500
 why I didn't share all this with him in detail,

1077
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,700
 like, when he interviewed me.

1078
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,900
 Like, I gotta tell him, like, where I've been,

1079
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,940
 and I know I'm the only one of my,

1080
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,580
 like, I'm convinced at that point,

1081
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,660
 I'm the only one of my kind.

1082
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,900
 I'm, like, scared for my job, I'm scared for everything.

1083
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,740
 Like, God wants me to, like, tell people how to be pure.

1084
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,820
 Like, I'm not pure.

1085
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,940
 Never have been, right?

1086
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,940
 And so I am scared, legitimately scared.

1087
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,420
 I work on a church staff, and I got a terrible past.

1088
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,980
 And so I walked up to JP,

1089
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,060
 and I'm sure he saw shame from a mile away.

1090
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,100
 I had my chin on my chest, and I was,

1091
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,100
 it was very clear that I did not like being the guy

1092
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,940
 with my story.

1093
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,700
 I did not like being the guy who had been where I'd been.

1094
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,780
 I said, JP, man, I wanna just share some stuff with you.

1095
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,100
 And so I downloaded with him everything

1096
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,200
 that I just downloaded with you in detail.

1097
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,860
 And I got done, and I thought for sure

1098
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,060
 that he was gonna look at me like I was from another planet.

1099
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,740
 How in the world could I be so messed up?

1100
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,100
 How in the world could I have deceived him?

1101
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,180
 How in the world, how in the world?

1102
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,160
 There's no disappointments coming.

1103
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,420
 And instead, he said, hey, Garrett, listen,

1104
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,660
 I wanna tell you something.

1105
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,920
 Don't ever be anybody except the guy with that story.

1106
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,760
 Don't ever try to be anybody except the guy with that story.

1107
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,100
 In fact, I want you to tell it,

1108
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,460
 and I'll tell you mine, I'll go first.

1109
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,260
 I walked away from that meeting,

1110
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,060
 and I felt like I was 10 feet tall.

1111
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,180
 I knew that I would never pass on a chance

1112
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,780
 to share my story in full.

1113
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,460
 I knew that I was not gonna let shame ruin my life.

1114
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,140
 I walked away for the first time,

1115
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,620
 knowing that even though, fully for the first time,

1116
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,780
 that even though there was sin to be acknowledged,

1117
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,120
 and there was shame that had been had,

1118
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,400
 and shame that had been walked through,

1119
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,900
 that I could be confident for the first time

1120
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,900
 in future grace and kindness toward me from God.

1121
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,460
 And all it took for God to get that message to me

1122
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,140
 was for another person with a past and a story

1123
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,160
 to step in and go first.

1124
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,900
 Then I will teach transgressors,

1125
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,220
 and other sinners will come back to you.

1126
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,060
 You see how that works?

1127
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,780
 You see how when one person gets strong,

1128
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,700
 you see how when one person is a brokenhearted sinner

1129
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,280
 who's been made glad by the grace of God,

1130
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,180
 when they step forward and allow God to use their story,

1131
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
 you see what it does to a room of people?

1132
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,380
 And so our vision here, okay,

1133
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,140
 the reason we meet on Tuesday nights,

1134
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,140
 the reason the church gathers,

1135
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,060
 is not so that we can create a city full of people

1136
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,740
 who don't have extramarital sex.

1137
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,140
 Dear God, I hope our vision's bigger than that.

1138
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,740
 And if we eliminated extramarital sex,

1139
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,260
 believe me, life would go better,

1140
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,900
 and there'd be less spiritual death in the city.

1141
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,140
 There's no question about it.

1142
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,180
 But that's not the key goal.

1143
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,940
 The goal would be, instead, that we're a group of people

1144
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,780
 that when they're brokenhearted over their own sin,

1145
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,720
 they're bold about it.

1146
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,900
 And when they're guilty, they're gutsy about it.

1147
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,260
 And whenever they've got nowhere to turn,

1148
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,860
 they turn to the grace of God and they plead.

1149
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,700
 I am guilty.

1150
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,920
 And they say, God, but you died for me,

1151
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,820
 and I'm confident of your future action

1152
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,700
 in favor of me, not against me.

1153
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,540
 And so guess what?

1154
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,980
 Because you've made me so secure,

1155
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,100
 no group of people seeing me as I am

1156
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,360
 could ever make me insecure.

1157
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,200
 So guess what?

1158
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,260
 What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna speak

1159
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,940
 exactly what you've done for me.

1160
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,820
 I'm gonna be bold when I'm brokenhearted.

1161
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,540
 I'll be gutsy when I'm guilty.

1162
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,080
 I'll let you use my story.

1163
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,140
 I'm not gonna sit there with a secret

1164
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,900
 in church ever again or in any other circle.

1165
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,340
 That's over.

1166
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,900
 Instead, I'm gonna talk about the way you gave me joy

1167
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,660
 despite the sin that I needed still to acknowledge.

1168
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,920
 I want you to imagine with me for a second

1169
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,500
 that whenever we are done here tonight,

1170
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,720
 that you walk out these doors,

1171
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,900
 or you walk out of the Ridgely Theater

1172
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,740
 if you're in Fort Worth,

1173
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,700
 or you put down your iPhone

1174
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,020
 if you're watching somewhere remotely,

1175
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,540
 or you walk out if you're hanging out down there in Houston,

1176
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,380
 and you walk out,

1177
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,500
 and instead of being afraid of your own story

1178
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,340
 and being plagued by sexual guilt

1179
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,820
 that you didn't even know was there,

1180
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,660
 what if instead of that,

1181
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,280
 what if you acknowledged everything that you'd ever done

1182
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,700
 before God and before some other trusted person?

1183
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,400
 You begged God to give you the joy,

1184
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,380
 this first certainty that he's for you in Christ,

1185
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,940
 and the willingness and the wherewithal to trust him,

1186
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,140
 and then the joy that should come with that.

1187
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,980
 And then why don't you tell what he's done for you?

1188
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,040
 When that happens, this will be a different place.

1189
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,320
 This will be a different world.

1190
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,160
 That's the truth.

1191
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,420
 So that's what we're aiming at.

1192
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,700
 And that's what's available to us.

1193
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,020
 And if you are willing,

1194
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,900
 if you're willing to go on that journey,

1195
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,380
 and it's a scary one, believe me,

1196
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,300
 if you're willing to go on that journey,

1197
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,500
 you won't just exhale in your relationship with God,

1198
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,660
 you'll talk about it.

1199
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:16,700
 Let's pray that we'd be those people.

1200
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,440
 Thank you, God, that you've acted for us

1201
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,980
 and not against us in Christ.

1202
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,680
 Thank you, God, that you didn't condemn us

1203
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,020
 when we condemned ourselves.

1204
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,940
 Thank you, God, that though there's nothing about us

1205
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,420
 that's lovable, not a single thing about us

1206
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,700
 that's lovable at times, you've bridged the gap.

1207
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,140
 You came for us.

1208
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,940
 There's no secret, there's no information

1209
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,580
 in any of these rooms that you don't know, not one bit.

1210
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,980
 Not the things we wanted, not the things we did.

1211
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,620
 Not the fact that there's a section of us here tonight

1212
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,560
 that never behaviorally did these things,

1213
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,580
 and we sit there proud, thinking we're clean.

1214
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,620
 It's not true either.

1215
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,820
 God, will you humble us all before you,

1216
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,020
 and then will you lift us up.

1217
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,720
 We don't wanna lift ourselves up.

1218
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,700
 We wanna allow you, God, to be the lifter of our head,

1219
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,420
 to get our chin off of our chest,

1220
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,260
 to be strengthened by your salvation and have joy in it.

1221
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,980
 And then allow you to use our story.

1222
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
 In Jesus' name.

1223
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,980
 In Jesus' name.
