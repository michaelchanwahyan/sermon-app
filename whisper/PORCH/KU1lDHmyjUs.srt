1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,000
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,680
 New series kicking off tonight.

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,480
 Welcome friends in the room and in Fort Worth

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,600
 and El Paso and Houston.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,400
 Fort Worth, last night in the Rizley Theater.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,780
 Get excited in Tulsa and Woodlands and Spring

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,360
 and Cedar Rapids, wherever you're joining us from.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,320
 We're glad that you're listening.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,200
 We are kicking off a new series tonight

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,000
 on Lyrics and Lies, Anthem Edition.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,980
 What is anthems?

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,200
 It's basically, we're gonna look at different songs

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,120
 that were an anthem to the last 10 to 15 years.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,640
 They kind of marked an era, marked an age

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,500
 and were songs that we all know the beat to.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,200
 They were your old ringtone when you were in high school.

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,520
 They may have been a song that came out

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,920
 when you were in junior high or college,

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,240
 but they're songs that over the last 10 years

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,000
 have just kind of been at the forefront.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,480
 These were big, big hits.

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,640
 And we're gonna cover a different topic each night

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
 and a few songs that connect to that.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,480
 Let me start this way with a little bit of a story

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,320
 to get us into.

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,720
 The other day I was leaving,

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,840
 I've got a two and a half year old son

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,000
 and I was leaving to go to work.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
 I came up to him, give him a hug.

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,880
 Hey, daddy's going to work, I'll see you soon.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
 And he began singing,

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,820
 ♪ Grownups come back ♪

34
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,420
 And I'm like, what are you guys doing here while I'm gone?

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,180
 What is mom teaching you?

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,540
 And then a couple of days go by later

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,860
 and he sings another song.

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,220
 He's like, I have to go potty.

39
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,820
 And he says, when you have to go potty,

40
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,900
 stop and go right away.

41
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,900
 And I'm like, what is your mother teaching you?

42
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,580
 And then it happened another time

43
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,660
 where he was like upset about something

44
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,140
 and he was like, when you feel so mad that you want to roar,

45
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,700
 take a deep breath and count to four.

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,760
 It's like, man, this is Eminem.

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,900
 We are raising a prodigy right here.

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,360
 But what had happened was

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,580
 he had been watching a TV show called Daniel Tiger.

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,480
 Oh my gosh, I got some big Daniel Tiger fans in the room.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,280
 Wow, that's curve ball.

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,660
 Which is this the show that I'm not even gonna go into,

53
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,960
 but point being on the show,

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,900
 they have like little songs that they'll teach

55
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,040
 and have the kids sing as they watch

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,960
 and in order to teach and instruct their behavior.

57
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,600
 It's pretty genius when you think about it

58
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,880
 'cause in listening to it, it's instructing how they act

59
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,200
 and it's influencing how he behaves

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,880
 and how he thinks about the world

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,600
 and even sees the world around him that,

62
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 hey, grownups leave, but they come back.

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,540
 You gotta go to the bathroom, you gotta go and on and on.

64
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,040
 And I start there because in a similar way,

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,000
 this is really something we never grow out of.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,560
 That the songs we listen to, the things that we watch

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,080
 and specifically for this series,

68
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,800
 the things that we're listening to

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
 influence the way that we think about the world around us.

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,720
 They influence the way that we see,

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,880
 the way that we behave oftentimes

72
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,520
 and they have an influence over how we see ourselves,

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
 what we think is valuable,

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,400
 where we think fun is to be had

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,920
 and just kind of how we see and perceive

76
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,660
 and behave inside of the world to varying degrees.

77
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,080
 And so we're gonna tackle in this series,

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,620
 different songs that have shaped

79
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,660
 really the last kind of 10 to 15 years

80
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,360
 and have shaped us and shaped parts

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,980
 of the way that we think about the world

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,500
 and attack some of the lies that are contained

83
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,880
 within the songs that are there.

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,500
 There's no question music is powerful.

85
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 Abraham Lincoln had a quote where he said,

86
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
 I'll read it so don't butcher it.

87
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,780
 "Whoever writes the nation's songs shapes the nation's soul."

88
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
 I mean, how powerful is that?

89
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,620
 And you're thinking like,

90
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,100
 Abe, what were you guys listening to back then?

91
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,420
 I mean, for real.

92
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,620
 But even then he's going, hey, the power of music

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,820
 and the power to write the songs that people are singing

94
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,380
 is gonna be a power that's gonna get implanted

95
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,300
 into people's heads.

96
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,200
 I mean, think about how many songs,

97
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,660
 how many song lyrics you have memorized

98
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,860
 and how many more you have memorized

99
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,140
 than all the scriptures.

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,460
 If you put together, you have memorized, it's crazy.

101
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,520
 And so we're gonna look at specifically certain lies

102
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,760
 over the next four weeks together.

103
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,760
 Tonight, we're gonna look at a couple of lies

104
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,940
 that are embedded over and over and over again

105
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,900
 and have been over and over embedded

106
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,340
 into different songs in the last 10 years.

107
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,740
 And so let me just play a few of them

108
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,820
 that'll give us a little framework.

109
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,460
 Here's what's embedded inside of all those songs.

110
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,940
 And it sounds silly, but it's this idea that,

111
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,980
 hey, you're perfect just the way you are.

112
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,740
 You do you, anyone who tells you you need to change

113
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,520
 or be anything different, they're just haters.

114
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,020
 Brush them off, you do you,

115
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,220
 you're perfect just the way that you are.

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,700
 And it's a message that is at the forefront,

117
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,740
 really, of so much of our culture.

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,500
 And it may be one of the most dangerous lies

119
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,820
 that if you're a Christian, you can believe,

120
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,220
 maybe if you're in general a person that you can believe.

121
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,780
 And I understand that a lot of the reason

122
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,140
 why Selena's singing it is she's trying to encourage

123
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,100
 the self-esteem of 13-year-old girls.

124
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,980
 But if you take that idea that, man, you're perfect

125
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,520
 just the way you are, you were born perfect,

126
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,500
 you don't need to change, other people need to change,

127
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,340
 don't listen to them.

128
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,220
 If you take that and you transfer it,

129
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,020
 not just to your external appearance

130
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,100
 as you go through puberty,

131
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,340
 but into the way that you think about life,

132
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
 into the way that you think about, man, the perfect,

133
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,780
 or I was made perfect, my desires,

134
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,780
 everything about me is perfect,

135
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,540
 you are going to forfeit everything

136
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,500
 God wants to do in your life.

137
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,620
 And it's gonna have implications,

138
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,580
 it's gonna cost you as a person in terms of growth,

139
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,900
 it's gonna cost you everything that the Bible says

140
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,540
 God wants to do for the rest of your life

141
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,380
 in and through you.

142
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,260
 And so we're gonna explore three lies and three truths,

143
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,060
 three lies from these songs, a number of them,

144
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,180
 and then three truths from God's word

145
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,140
 that this may be the message

146
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,700
 that most in our culture right now people are believing,

147
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,980
 that, hey, just the way you are is perfect,

148
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,380
 don't let anyone tell you something other.

149
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,260
 That you're really a good person at the end of the day

150
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,540
 who has it together and you don't need to worry

151
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,700
 about changing, let the world change around you,

152
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,020
 and we're gonna see it is just not true.

153
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,260
 So we're gonna explore three truths,

154
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,100
 we're gonna jump around,

155
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,940
 this series will be a topical look

156
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,900
 at some things in culture,

157
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,620
 and then we just take what does God's word say

158
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,840
 in response to some of these embedded lies

159
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,940
 that are inside of there.

160
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,260
 The most dangerous thing about this lie tonight,

161
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,900
 that, hey, you're so loved, you're perfect,

162
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,780
 you're beautiful just the way you are,

163
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,740
 is it may be one of the more dangerous lies

164
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,620
 because it's a distorted version.

165
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,620
 In other words, each one of these things that I'm saying,

166
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,900
 you're perfect, you're loved,

167
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,720
 you just need to embrace who you are,

168
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,980
 it's such a dangerous lie

169
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,940
 because it's not like some huge out there,

170
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,500
 like, hey, you're an alien, that's not what it is,

171
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
 it's like a distorted, just twisted version of the truth,

172
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,180
 which is how Satan works best.

173
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,100
 He's not gonna come with some huge out there crazy lies,

174
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,140
 he's just gonna take the truth and twist it just slightly,

175
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,780
 and that's what he's doing here.

176
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,180
 And so we're gonna look through these three lies

177
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,340
 and three truths that correspond to each one of them,

178
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,300
 and I'll just kick it off right here.

179
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,280
 The first one is the lie that we've already said

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,260
 or alluded to, that you are perfect.

181
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,460
 But Pink in her song says,

182
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,620
 "Pretty please don't ever feel you're less than perfect."

183
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,140
 As Christina already said, you're beautiful in every way,

184
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,180
 words can't bring you down, you're so beautiful

185
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,260
 no matter what anyone says.

186
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,980
 Or as Selena said, "Who says you're not perfect?

187
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,860
 "Who says you're not perfect?"

188
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,180
 I don't know who's believing this, honestly.

189
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,660
 Like, I think, I don't know who's writing these songs

190
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,100
 and being like, yeah, tell 'em they're perfect.

191
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,660
 Who actually believes that at the end of the day?

192
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,300
 I think most of us are at least familiar enough

193
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
 to be like, yeah, that's positive, I wanna believe it,

194
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,300
 but if this is perfection, oh, we're in trouble.

195
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,660
 (audience laughing)

196
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,220
 I mean, it's just a, it's a blatant lie.

197
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,160
 The truth from God's word, as simple as that sounds,

198
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,000
 is that you're broken, and so am I,

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,020
 and so is every person who's ever lived, who's out there,

200
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,660
 that you're broken.

201
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,420
 And in attempting to build up self-esteem,

202
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,340
 they just overcorrect and just tell 'em that they're perfect.

203
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,940
 And if you embrace that, you embrace it the way that,

204
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,900
 the desires you have, the personality you have,

205
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,980
 who you are is perfect, and others need to conform to you.

206
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,660
 You are just looking for that perfect someone in your world

207
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,060
 who's gonna perfectly compliment your perfection.

208
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,980
 You are gonna be looking for a unicorn,

209
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,260
 as it relates to a spouse,

210
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,420
 and you are going to fail to grow in any way.

211
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,660
 The first lie is that you're perfect,

212
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,300
 and the truth from God's word is that you are broken,

213
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,140
 and so am I.

214
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,580
 The Bible says this in Psalm 51, verses four through five,

215
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,620
 where it says you're broken because of sin, you're sinful.

216
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
 David says, "Surely I was sinful at birth,"

217
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,380
 like from my birth, I've been covered in sin.

218
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,880
 "Sinful from the time that my mother conceived me,

219
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
 "that I'm not just a basically good person.

220
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,940
 "I am a sinner, my parents were sinners.

221
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,540
 "I come into this world with a sin nature

222
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,720
 "that taints everything inside of my life."

223
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,640
 I mean, even the fact that, I think logically,

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,960
 you gotta think that even the singers of these songs

225
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,320
 don't believe this.

226
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,400
 They're just putting it out there.

227
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
 I mean, 'cause no one would say,

228
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,240
 or I'm sure none of them would say,

229
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,120
 "Yes, I'm universally speaking to everyone,

230
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
 "everywhere, always.

231
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,460
 "They're perfect just the way they are.

232
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,160
 "ISIS, you do you.

233
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,160
 "And sex slavery traders, you do you."

234
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,140
 And we'd all just say, "Ah, yeah, that doesn't really apply

235
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,880
 "to you, not perfect in that direction."

236
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,940
 There's places where we'd all agree it just breaks down.

237
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,600
 You know, there's an association called NAMLA,

238
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
 which you may have heard us talk about before,

239
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,200
 National Association of Man-Boy Love,

240
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
 which is a group that advocates for,

241
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,380
 hey, people are pedophiles too,

242
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,960
 and wants to advocate for pedophilia

243
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,160
 being something people were born with,

244
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,040
 and that's okay and it should be embraced.

245
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,160
 They're perfect the way they are.

246
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,440
 That is a lie.

247
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,960
 And I think all of us, even the singers of these songs,

248
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,260
 would address and believe that,

249
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,900
 that someone, some people out there may not be perfect.

250
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,100
 And the Bible over and over again teaches

251
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,040
 the reason you are not perfect,

252
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,420
 the reason you're broken, is because of sin.

253
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,720
 That sin came into the world,

254
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,640
 and when Adam sinned, it's like he caught the infection,

255
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,520
 and everything inside of him was contaminated,

256
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,000
 and every descendant that he would ever have,

257
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
 Adam being Adam and Eve,

258
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
 are the original beginning of creation,

259
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,640
 and the original parents, if you will,

260
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,420
 of all of human race.

261
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,640
 When Adam sinned, he introduced sin into all of the world,

262
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,660
 and all of a sudden, all of his descendants

263
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,560
 caught the disease.

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
 All of them were contaminated.

265
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,360
 In Romans chapter five, verses 12, it says this,

266
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,840
 that Adam, just as sin entered the world through one man,

267
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,340
 and death through sin, in the same way,

268
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,740
 death came to all people because all sinned.

269
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,140
 Basically, the Bible teaches that, hey, in Adam,

270
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,160
 all of us, when Adam sinned, all of his DNA,

271
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,680
 all of a sudden, was tainted and contaminated with sin,

272
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
 and for all of human history,

273
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,120
 every child of Adam, son of Adam or daughter of Eve,

274
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,180
 has been infected with the disease that's around you.

275
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,840
 The Bible says this is a sin nature.

276
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
 What is a sin nature?

277
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,740
 Sin nature means sinning comes naturally.

278
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,480
 And I always feel like this kind of goes without saying,

279
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,280
 but just in case it doesn't, I mean, think about it.

280
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,800
 Think about how easy it is,

281
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,100
 or the fact that sinning does come naturally.

282
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,940
 Like, none of us came in here

283
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,400
 and had to work at being selfish.

284
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,900
 Like, if I'm honest, I'm really good at loving me.

285
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,240
 I love me some me, and I'm great at loving me,

286
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,140
 and my guess is, in neutral, so are you.

287
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,320
 Nobody in here had to work at their lust problem,

288
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
 like, you know what, I'm really,

289
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,440
 this year has been my year.

290
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,600
 I'm doing paleo, and I'm working on lust,

291
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,520
 increasing my lust.

292
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,960
 No one has that problem.

293
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,900
 Greed is not something you have to attempt to do.

294
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,040
 It's something that just can grab ahold of you.

295
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
 Jealousy.

296
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,480
 No one is trying, oh man, I'm just not a jealous person,

297
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,520
 and I'm trying to be more jealous.

298
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,000
 Gosh, I just can't do it.

299
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,280
 It just grabs us.

300
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,160
 It comes naturally.

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,880
 The Bible is just saying what we've all seen,

302
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,780
 we've all experienced, is that you are not perfect,

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,720
 and you're a broken person, just like me,

304
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,640
 because sin has come in and contaminated

305
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,740
 everything inside of us.

306
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,920
 Now, here's where the distortion comes in,

307
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,680
 because you may be thinking, doesn't the Bible say,

308
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,000
 I'm fearfully and wonderfully made?

309
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,600
 Like, God made me?

310
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,240
 I'm fearfully and perfectly made,

311
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
 and he wove me together in my mother's womb,

312
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,800
 Psalm 139 says?

313
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,700
 Yes.

314
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,280
 But when the infection of sin was introduced

315
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,080
 into the human race, everything got tainted.

316
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,080
 So your personality, your desires, your will,

317
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,600
 your mind, all of it, the Bible teaches,

318
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,840
 was contaminated by sin.

319
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,980
 Now, there's things that can restrain us,

320
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,780
 and the Spirit of God can allow us to find victory

321
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,300
 over those things, but all of us

322
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,040
 have been totally contaminated,

323
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,960
 and everything that sin has touched is contaminated.

324
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,800
 It's a little bit like this.

325
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
 This is gonna be a weird illustration,

326
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,420
 but just go with me here for a second.

327
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,560
 Let's say we're hanging out this Saturday,

328
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,240
 you come over, hanging at my house,

329
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,600
 and we're getting together, and I'm like,

330
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,760
 oh yeah, I'm gonna make some punch,

331
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,240
 we're hanging in the backyard, it's going great,

332
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,080
 we're grilling.

333
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,700
 All of a sudden, you go and you go to drink some punch,

334
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,080
 and I'm like, hey, just wanna give you a heads up.

335
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,440
 I had the punch on the ground, my dog came over,

336
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
 peed in the punch.

337
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,360
 So just, you do you, and here's what I'm confident,

338
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,880
 I know, this is so, just go with me.

339
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,360
 Here's what I'm confident your next question would not be.

340
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,840
 Well, how much pee?

341
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,160
 (audience laughing)

342
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,320
 How much?

343
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,240
 It would be, okay, I'm gonna pass,

344
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,940
 hard pass on the punch, I'm okay.

345
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,280
 Because any contamination, it's ruined.

346
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,240
 The punch is done.

347
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,200
 (laughing)

348
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,920
 That's such a weird illustration.

349
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,320
 And the Bible says that in the same way,

350
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,700
 when sin touched humanity, and when sin,

351
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,980
 which is a part of your life, by choice and by birth,

352
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,520
 you're born with a sin nature, and you choose to sin,

353
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,640
 and in doing so, when sin touched the human race,

354
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,360
 it contaminated everything.

355
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,840
 And there's varying degrees to how much sin

356
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,320
 has been a part of your life, but according to the Bible,

357
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,560
 you are broken.

358
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,220
 And sin has come in and contaminated

359
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,820
 everything that it's touched.

360
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,520
 Everything that it's touched.

361
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,160
 The first point is that you're not perfect, you are broken.

362
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,820
 And if you're gonna experience healing

363
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,280
 from any brokenness or growth in your life,

364
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,920
 you will have to come to the place where you realize,

365
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,520
 I am broken, which means the solution

366
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,680
 for my brokenness doesn't come from me.

367
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,440
 I don't know if you're a Christian,

368
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,660
 really, whatever you believe,

369
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,080
 if you come to the place where you realize,

370
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,140
 man, I really do have a sin nature,

371
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,320
 there's something broken in me, what is that?

372
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,840
 If you're gonna experience healing

373
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
 in realizing you're broken, you're taking that first step,

374
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
 because you are also realizing,

375
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,600
 which means the solution to my brokenness

376
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
 doesn't come from in me.

377
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,880
 The second lie that we see from these songs

378
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,680
 that we're covering tonight is the lie that,

379
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,320
 hey, because you are loved, you do not need to change.

380
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,740
 You just need to accept yourself, love yourself, and move on.

381
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,120
 Lady Gaga said it this way, she says,

382
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,120
 that there's nothing wrong with loving who you are,

383
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,240
 'cause he, God, made you perfect.

384
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,800
 So hold your head up, girl, you'll go far.

385
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,420
 Listen to me when I say, I'm beautiful in my way,

386
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,000
 God makes no mistakes, I'm on the right track, baby,

387
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,720
 I was born this way, don't hide yourself in regret,

388
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,220
 just love yourself and you're set.

389
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,160
 I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way.

390
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
 The lie again, hey, you're loved,

391
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,720
 just love yourself and you'll be set.

392
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,360
 Who you are, you do you,

393
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,840
 that's all that you need to worry about.

394
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,200
 You don't need to change, you're loved just as you are.

395
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,120
 And the Bible says, the Christian message is

396
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,880
 that because you are loved, Christ wants to change you.

397
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,160
 That because Christ loves you, he wants to change you,

398
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,560
 and he will change you if you put your faith

399
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,620
 and trust in him, he'll begin to chip away at your life

400
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,380
 and begin to change your life,

401
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,180
 day by day, moment by moment.

402
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,880
 That's what Christianity teaches,

403
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,120
 that God does love you just the way you are.

404
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
 He loves you too much, though, to leave you that way.

405
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,780
 This is what the Bible teaches,

406
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,540
 that God loves you just exactly like you walked in here,

407
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,260
 right now, wherever you're at in this room,

408
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,020
 whatever your spiritual journey is,

409
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,380
 whatever sin struggle you're having, dominate your life.

410
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,280
 Whatever your past is, whatever you've done,

411
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,660
 God is crazy in love with you.

412
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,640
 And he loves you so much that he doesn't just accept you,

413
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,000
 he accepts you and loves you enough

414
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,560
 to not accept you not changing,

415
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,200
 that he's gonna come in and because he loves,

416
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
 begin to change and transform your life.

417
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,720
 That's what the Christian life is.

418
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,640
 It's not static, it's not, hey, I put my faith on the shelf

419
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,240
 and it's just, you know, I keep working,

420
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
 working, church at church.

421
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,660
 It is a constant growing to meet more like Jesus.

422
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,180
 The Bible says in Romans 8, verses 28 and 29,

423
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,100
 this, that we know in all things,

424
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,300
 God works for the good of those who love him,

425
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,860
 who've been called according to his purpose.

426
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,960
 He's talking about Christians.

427
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,460
 And here's the good that God works about.

428
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,380
 For those who God foreknew, he predestined to be conformed

429
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,220
 or to be transformed into the image of his son,

430
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,880
 that he might be the firstborn

431
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,320
 among many brothers and sisters.

432
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,960
 So the Bible teaches is that because God loves you,

433
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,360
 he's gonna come into your life

434
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,320
 and begin to transform anything inside of your life

435
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,780
 that does not look like Jesus.

436
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,520
 There is a, I don't know if you're familiar

437
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,760
 with the statue of David.

438
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,240
 It was by Michelangelo and there we go.

439
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,340
 There's the PG version, folks.

440
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,880
 When Michelangelo constructed this,

441
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,320
 which was a few hundred years ago, it's amazing structure.

442
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,040
 It's one of just the things that people travel

443
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,760
 all over the world to construct.

444
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,300
 And Michelangelo was asked one day, how did you make it?

445
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,540
 How did you construct or how did you chisel out

446
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,040
 this incredible thing from a single block of marble?

447
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,280
 And he said, it was easy.

448
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,400
 I just chiseled away everything that didn't look like David.

449
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,600
 That's what the Bible teaches God is doing in your life.

450
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,440
 That for the rest of your life, if you're a Christian,

451
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,660
 he loves you too much to leave you that way.

452
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,180
 And he's gonna chisel every single part of your life

453
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,940
 that is not consistent with his son because he loves you.

454
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,060
 And it would be unloving to stop at anything short.

455
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,960
 I have, like I mentioned earlier, a son

456
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,820
 and we recently went to the doctor and the doctor said,

457
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,560
 hey, there's a couple things you guys as parents

458
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,760
 need to make sure change in your son

459
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
 before his three year old birthday.

460
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,520
 And she said, you gotta get the whole potty training thing

461
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,520
 down and the middle of the night wake ups and the pacifier.

462
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,360
 I know this is exciting stuff, welcome to my world.

463
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,780
 What's the middle of the night wake ups?

464
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,880
 We're at this stage where he's like, he's gonna come

465
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,120
 at either 2 a.m., 3 a.m., I'll be awake, just FYI.

466
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,600
 He's gonna come into our room.

467
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,720
 I won't be awake naturally, but he's gonna come in,

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,360
 wake me up and then it's a game of like whatever

469
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,540
 I have to tell you in order to get to stay up

470
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,380
 for a little bit.

471
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,900
 So it's like, hey, I'm thirsty right now.

472
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,460
 Or I drank too much water or he'll come in and be like,

473
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,600
 I need to put socks on or he'll come in again

474
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
 and be like, I need to take my socks off.

475
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,280
 But the best one true story, this kid is gonna be a lawyer.

476
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,040
 He came in and was like, I need to change my socks.

477
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,660
 These socks have been on for too long.

478
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,180
 And he's just like, oh my gosh, this is terrible.

479
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,800
 And then the potty training thing goes without saying,

480
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,680
 pacifier thing.

481
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,240
 Here's what would be unloving.

482
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,000
 If we turn to that doctor and we said, look,

483
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,940
 we are not changing him.

484
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,660
 Are you kidding me?

485
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,420
 That would be so unloving.

486
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,420
 We're gonna let him do him.

487
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,940
 Okay, if he wants to wear a diaper when he's in high school,

488
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,980
 that's great.

489
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,660
 Pacifier, we're cool with it.

490
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,900
 If he marries some girl someday and wakes her up at two

491
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,420
 and is like, can you change my socks?

492
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,520
 We're great with that.

493
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,180
 Because we love our child.

494
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,280
 You would be like, you guys are lunatics.

495
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,640
 You are cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

496
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,780
 What is wrong with you?

497
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,540
 That's not loving to a child.

498
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,720
 That's what God in the Bible teaches over and over.

499
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,240
 God is doing his, he's a part of bringing change

500
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,500
 in your life and in my life.

501
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,320
 Not because he doesn't love you,

502
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,240
 but precisely exactly 'cause he's crazy about you

503
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,720
 and he loves you.

504
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,640
 He wants to see you become all that you can be.

505
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,320
 And he knows that all that your potential to be

506
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,800
 is connected to you becoming more and more like Christ.

507
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,240
 More free from sin.

508
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,200
 More and more to look like Jesus.

509
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,500
 And so a lot of times people will say things like,

510
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,540
 man, that's just the way that I am.

511
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,080
 I'm a short-tempered kind of guy.

512
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,660
 Jesus wants to change that.

513
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,740
 People say, man, it's just the way that I am.

514
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,140
 Like, you know, I kind of like my me time,

515
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,060
 my I'm alone time.

516
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,560
 Anything in your life that doesn't look like Jesus,

517
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,500
 he's gonna change.

518
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,940
 People will say things like, I'm not quick to trust

519
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,620
 or I kind of hold a grudge.

520
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,900
 Everything in your life that doesn't look like Jesus,

521
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,300
 the spirit of God wants to kill and change.

522
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,180
 And that's what he's gonna do.

523
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,780
 And in eternity, fully and finally,

524
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,940
 but from now until then,

525
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,500
 that's what the spirit of God is at work,

526
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,740
 convicting and bringing about to chisel away

527
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,860
 every part of you that doesn't look like Jesus.

528
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,660
 That's what the message of Christianity is.

529
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,820
 Not because you're loved, you don't need to change.

530
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,660
 Because God loves you, he will bring about change

531
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,140
 and wants to bring about change

532
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,620
 inside of your life, inside of me.

533
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,340
 And then finally, third point,

534
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,500
 comes from a song that was written by Macklemore,

535
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,600
 the rapper, that same love that I can't change,

536
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,160
 even if I tried, even if I wanted to, I can't change.

537
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,100
 Now, I don't wanna go into, when this song came out,

538
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,020
 it was clearly connected to another message

539
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,300
 that, you know, in case you were under a rock in 2015

540
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,740
 or underground, it was connected

541
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,740
 to the homosexual movement, and it's clearly about that.

542
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,780
 What I'm connecting to in this song

543
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,060
 is a message that's repeated here,

544
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,100
 repeated over and over again,

545
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,420
 that, hey, you can't change, you shouldn't try,

546
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,660
 you should just embrace and accept who you are.

547
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,720
 And it's a lie.

548
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,460
 The idea that change is impossible is a lie.

549
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,760
 Where he gets it right is the truth is,

550
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,740
 as Christians, we believe you can't change, that's right.

551
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,840
 But Christ can change you is the truth.

552
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,980
 That you can't change on your own,

553
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,420
 but Christ can come in and will come in

554
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,180
 to all who allow him and accept him as Lord and Savior,

555
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,380
 and he will begin to bring about change

556
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,640
 inside of your life and inside of my life.

557
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,540
 There's really three ways that the Bible says

558
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,940
 he brings about change inside of our life,

559
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,620
 so I just wanna talk about that quickly

560
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,380
 and then show an example of the ways

561
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,700
 that God brings about change, and then close,

562
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,600
 and we'll be done from there.

563
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,180
 But there's three ways, if you wanna experience change,

564
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,660
 if you're going to change,

565
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,980
 if you're gonna experience change in your life,

566
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,380
 it's gonna involve these three criteria,

567
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,100
 or these three things that over and over again,

568
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,940
 God says, this is the means by which I transform people.

569
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,540
 If you wanna experience, if you have an eating disorder,

570
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,060
 if you're addicted to pornography,

571
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,020
 if you have an addiction to alcohol,

572
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,580
 or maybe you're just, you're covered in anxiety

573
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,540
 all the time, or jealousy, or you're codependent,

574
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,960
 in every relationship you get in, you're codependent.

575
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,560
 You don't have to stay that way.

576
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,660
 And the God who's there promises that if you will come to him

577
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,900
 and allow him to work, and allow specifically,

578
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,420
 follow him in these three ways, you will experience freedom.

579
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,460
 This is the method by which God changes

580
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,360
 and transforms people.

581
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,220
 People say, I got family members that are like,

582
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,700
 you know, people don't really change.

583
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,680
 People change.

584
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,980
 I don't know who you're hanging out with

585
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
 if you're like, oh, people don't change.

586
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,780
 Apparently, your friends don't change.

587
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,420
 I work around people all the time

588
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,780
 that have been radically changed.

589
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,680
 I mean, I was going around with our team today,

590
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
 just in our team time, and we got everything from like,

591
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,080
 hey, I was divorced, I was addicted,

592
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 I was overwhelmed in anxiety, I was an alcoholic,

593
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,000
 everything in between, and these people,

594
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,580
 it's like, man, I would've thought you grew up

595
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,160
 on a seminary or something, or like,

596
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 you were just, you spent your whole life in church

597
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,340
 'cause God has radically transformed your life.

598
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,840
 I mean, our main worship leaders,

599
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,080
 Shane was leading worship.

600
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,880
 I was thinking about John, who leads on Sunday.

601
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,500
 The dude was in a gang for like the first 20 years,

602
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,120
 or when he was 20 years old, he was in a gang.

603
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
 I look at that, and I'm like, dude, how is that possible?

604
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,620
 John, you're like the nicest, most meek guy of all time.

605
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,740
 It's hard to think of you being in a gang together,

606
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,780
 and he's like, I was, man, it was thug life.

607
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,400
 And it's crazy.

608
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,460
 God brings about change, and so let me tell you how

609
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,620
 he's bringing about change in my life, our team's life,

610
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,260
 anyone who's experiencing change through him

611
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,780
 is experiencing it these three ways.

612
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,340
 The first is by living out God's word.

613
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,300
 Not by reading God's word, not by having a quiet time,

614
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,340
 not by attending the porch on Tuesday nights,

615
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,180
 by living out what the Bible says.

616
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,800
 Here's what James, the brother of Jesus says

617
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,840
 in James chapter one, verses 22.

618
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,720
 "Do not merely listen to the word or the Bible,

619
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,900
 "and so deceive yourselves."

620
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,880
 To us, he would say, do not merely listen or read.

621
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,540
 At that time, they didn't have Bibles.

622
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,220
 They just had some of the letters.

623
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,260
 So he's saying, hey, don't listen,

624
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,740
 don't show up and listen, don't just show up and read it.

625
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,380
 And so deceive yourselves.

626
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,820
 Do what it says.

627
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,280
 Anyone who listens to the word,

628
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,140
 but does not do what it says,

629
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,780
 is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror,

630
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,320
 and after looking at himself in the mirror,

631
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,460
 goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.

632
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,000
 But whoever looks intently into the perfect law

633
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,460
 that gives freedom and continues in it,

634
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,060
 is doing it, not forgetting what they heard, but doing it,

635
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,440
 they will be blessed in everything that they do.

636
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,700
 James says, hey, don't be people who,

637
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,500
 if you just show up on Tuesday nights,

638
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,540
 you're gonna get good vibes,

639
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,840
 hopefully you'll be encouraged,

640
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,820
 but it will not be enough to allow you

641
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,480
 to experience change in your life.

642
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,620
 You have to be someone who doesn't just read the Bible,

643
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,500
 they apply the Bible every single day.

644
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,540
 Here's something, let me just say

645
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,140
 the most provocative way I can put this.

646
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,980
 The Bible doesn't change people's lives.

647
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,500
 It doesn't.

648
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,060
 Applying the Bible changes people's lives.

649
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,500
 The Bible doesn't change people's lives

650
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,020
 any more than looking into a mirror

651
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,220
 changes the way that you look.

652
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,440
 You look into a mirror and you're like,

653
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,360
 oh, whoa, curve ball, I need to change that,

654
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,640
 or man, I woke up like this and it was not pretty.

655
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,520
 And that's what you do when you look into a mirror.

656
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,680
 But the mirror doesn't like shave your face.

657
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,120
 The mirror doesn't apply mascara,

658
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,140
 the mirror just tells you, whoa.

659
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,440
 That's what a mirror does.

660
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,920
 (audience laughing)

661
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,200
 I'm like, showing you what I think

662
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,720
 when I look in the mirror, like, whoa.

663
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
 Anyways, let's keep going.

664
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,720
 In the same way, the Bible doesn't change people's lives.

665
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,100
 Doing what the Bible says changes people's lives.

666
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,660
 If you're gonna experience being changed

667
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,660
 or transformed for Christ, it will involve you

668
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,020
 not just reading, but applying God's word into your life.

669
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,300
 The second is not just living out God's word,

670
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,580
 it's living in community with God's people.

671
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,980
 Hebrews chapter three, verses 12 and 13 say this.

672
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,200
 See that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart

673
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,040
 that turns away from the living God.

674
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,440
 So be careful, watch out, that none of you

675
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,600
 has a heart that would turn away.

676
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,000
 And then he says, how do you make sure

677
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,400
 that you're careful and not have your heart

678
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,440
 turn away from God?

679
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,740
 Here's the remedy.

680
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,100
 But encourage one another daily,

681
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,420
 as long as it's called today,

682
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,880
 so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness

683
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,840
 or by sin's deceitfulness.

684
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,660
 That the antidote, the Bible says,

685
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,040
 for you having a heart that doesn't turn away,

686
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,340
 for your faith staying strong, continuing to grow,

687
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,620
 for you to experience change in your life,

688
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,260
 for you to conquer addiction,

689
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,620
 for you to get over and to grow

690
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,360
 into all that God has for you,

691
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,620
 for you to experience freedom and meaning and just life,

692
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,160
 like not a sense of emptiness,

693
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,100
 you will have to be connected to other believers

694
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,380
 in a real way.

695
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,020
 Like you're gonna have to be in a small group

696
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,820
 or at your church, whatever they call them,

697
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,620
 life groups, home groups, Sunday Bible study,

698
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,080
 I don't know what, if you don't attend here, they're called,

699
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,140
 but you've gotta have real authentic relationships

700
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,980
 in your life with other believers

701
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,780
 who know where you need to be encouraged daily,

702
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,040
 who you can come along and do what James 5, 16 says,

703
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,140
 confess your sins to one another

704
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,520
 so that you would be healed.

705
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,220
 If you don't have those people,

706
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,780
 you're not gonna experience change.

707
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,220
 And you are forfeiting one of the primary ways

708
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,060
 God says he's gonna speak to you and protect you.

709
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,380
 I mean, this is like, I hope you know,

710
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,640
 this is like so real to not just, you know,

711
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,020
 the broader group, this is real to me,

712
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,180
 it's real to our staff,

713
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,460
 we're all a part of small groups and groups with people

714
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,580
 that know where we're struggling,

715
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,820
 know where we need to be prayed for.

716
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,880
 Recently in the past few weeks,

717
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,540
 I entered into another group called ReGen,

718
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,440
 where I'm just going, God, there's areas of my heart I hate,

719
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,660
 I'm prideful.

720
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,580
 And I think that I'm better than people.

721
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,160
 I think that I know better, candidly,

722
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,540
 I'm always like, yeah, that's dumb.

723
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,780
 And I think that I know better and I hate it.

724
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,700
 And I don't wanna live the rest of my life

725
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,740
 allowing pride to hurt my relationships,

726
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,540
 to hinder growing into the person,

727
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,460
 I have control problems and anger problems.

728
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,040
 And I don't wanna allow those things that impact my life.

729
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,620
 I wanna take ground and the good news is,

730
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,260
 I know that there's a God who changes people.

731
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,060
 I've seen him change in my own life.

732
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,860
 And he's a God that when you and I begin to apply

733
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,040
 these things, brings about change inside of your life,

734
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,020
 there is hope.

735
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,220
 You do not have to stay the way that you are.

736
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,780
 And the spirit of God doesn't want you

737
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,500
 to stay the way that you are.

738
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,200
 But you will, if you're not living in community,

739
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,340
 if other people are not aware of the areas

740
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,940
 where you are tempted, where you are giving in to sin,

741
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,060
 where other people are not coming along you regularly,

742
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,260
 not like I call this guy on the phone every now and then,

743
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,220
 then I call her and we talk every now and then,

744
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,420
 we're accountability and they say they pray.

745
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,960
 Daily, it says, they are in your life.

746
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,100
 And if you do not have that, you are missing out

747
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,980
 on one of the key ways that God brings change.

748
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,380
 If you are dating and the person you're dating

749
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,460
 doesn't have that, you should be scared.

750
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,180
 I don't know how more lovingly to put it.

751
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,780
 You should be afraid.

752
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,580
 And you should tell that person, you need community

753
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,620
 because you are dating someone who the Bible says is a fool.

754
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,860
 Proverbs 18, one says, whoever isolates himself,

755
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,460
 quarrels or fights against sound wisdom.

756
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,460
 What do you call someone who fights against sound wisdom?

757
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,580
 A fool.

758
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,100
 And it says, they seek their own desires.

759
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,140
 They do what, you know, they think at the end of the day,

760
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,900
 hey, I prayed about it, this is what I think I should do.

761
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,380
 And the Bible says that person living in isolation

762
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,320
 is a fool.

763
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,260
 Am I saying you should break up?

764
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,980
 I don't know, I'm saying that you're dating someone

765
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,380
 who's living foolishly and you should be scared

766
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,300
 or you should at least bring the conversation up

767
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,860
 and be like, hey girl, I'm gonna make sure

768
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,020
 you're not seven times as crazy.

769
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,660
 Do you have community?

770
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,480
 Or hey guy, what's the deal?

771
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,140
 Are there guys in your life that know what's going on?

772
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,780
 Number three, so living out God's word,

773
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,500
 living in community with God's people.

774
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,620
 And then the third one is living in dependence

775
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,540
 on God's spirit.

776
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,780
 The Bible says that the Christian life is a constant mode.

777
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,820
 I'm just dependent on you one day at a time,

778
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,860
 one day at a time.

779
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,660
 What does it look like to live dependent on God's spirit?

780
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,900
 This one honestly, I think is the hardest one

781
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,500
 to try to communicate.

782
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,420
 I think it's a constant communication and prayer

783
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,320
 of God, will you help me right now?

784
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,160
 Will you help me?

785
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,180
 I'm gonna walk into this room,

786
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,420
 I'm gonna be tempted to be concerned

787
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,280
 about what everyone else thinks about me.

788
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,580
 God, will you help me right now?

789
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,940
 As I just get overwhelmed thinking about the future

790
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,020
 and I need your help.

791
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,540
 I'm constantly inviting you.

792
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,980
 I'm constantly trying to be sensitive

793
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,220
 to when the Lord I feel like is kind of pricking,

794
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,300
 like hey, I want you to speak up right now

795
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,940
 and be sensitive to his leading.

796
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,900
 I think it involves being dependent on the spirit

797
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
 is a constant prayer communication

798
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,940
 and an awareness of God's presence

799
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,180
 and sovereignty in your life.

800
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,420
 Those are big words.

801
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,140
 They may not mean as clear,

802
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,120
 but I think that's honestly one of the best way

803
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,280
 that I know how to put it is it is a constant,

804
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
 I'm just constantly aware,

805
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,840
 I'm constantly communicating with you God.

806
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,000
 Will you help me Lord?

807
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
 I'm dependent on you.

808
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,000
 If this is on my strength, I'm not gonna make it.

809
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,760
 Lord, will you help me?

810
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,560
 And that posture of I'm dependent on you

811
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,440
 and then just an awareness that hey,

812
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,740
 God, you're at work, you're around me,

813
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,840
 you're in control,

814
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,200
 that I'm constantly dependent on you.

815
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,960
 You know what just happened.

816
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,460
 You're not surprised by these events

817
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,920
 and so I'm gonna trust you.

818
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,140
 Will you help me that you live,

819
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,160
 living out God's word,

820
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,200
 living in community with God's people

821
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,360
 and living in constant dependence on the spirit of God.

822
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,560
 I think it's such a tragedy

823
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,080
 that so many people put their faith on the shelf

824
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
 and they don't experience change.

825
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,280
 I mean, how many people over the age of 35 do you know

826
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,320
 that like, oh yeah, hey, I'm a Christian,

827
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,840
 that's important to me,

828
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,320
 but it doesn't impact anything about their life.

829
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,160
 Doesn't impact the way that they did marriage,

830
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,040
 doesn't impact the way that they handle finances,

831
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,680
 it impacts the way that they attend X church every so often

832
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
 and you know, that's a good thing.

833
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,160
 The Bible says your whole life,

834
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
 for the rest of your life,

835
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,560
 God wants to transform you and bring about change

836
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
 and there is no limit.

837
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,920
 Gosh, I just want you to get this so bad.

838
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,320
 You have no idea how God wants to use you.

839
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,480
 You have no idea how God can use you, will use you.

840
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,840
 Like inside of the room,

841
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,360
 there's probably honestly an overestimating of yourself.

842
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,080
 You think more highly of who you are right now

843
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,680
 and you don't think highly enough about who you could be

844
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,160
 and who God wants you to be.

845
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,880
 And inside of the scripture,

846
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,360
 you are told and I'm told,

847
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,920
 you're not gonna get there apart from these things.

848
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,840
 You're not gonna experience,

849
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,760
 you probably could not dream highly enough of the person,

850
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,520
 the father you could be, the mother you could be,

851
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,360
 the husband, wife, the type of leader,

852
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,440
 follower of Jesus, the influencer that you could be.

853
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,360
 There is no ceiling that is beyond

854
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,720
 what God could do with your life.

855
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,120
 You're probably underestimating that

856
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,000
 and overestimating where you are right now.

857
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And the God who's there says,

858
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,840
 man, if you will daily in everyday ordinary moments,

859
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,360
 live out my word, be dependent on me

860
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,560
 and walk in community with other believers,

861
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,960
 you do that, you're gonna see transformation

862
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,240
 like you wouldn't even believe.

863
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,320
 This is how it's always worked, how it always will work

864
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,300
 and how God is at work right now.

865
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,080
 In fact, instead of our ministry,

866
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,680
 we were talking today with some friends of Fort Worth.

867
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,260
 Fort Worth is, this is their last time

868
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,160
 in the Ridgely Theater,

869
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,520
 which is where they've been meeting.

870
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,760
 There's another building that they're moving into.

871
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,800
 And one of the reasons they're moving out of that

872
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,840
 is because they're running out of space

873
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,520
 because God is at work changing people's lives

874
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,840
 in such radical ways.

875
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,360
 And so we wanted to hear or give you a chance to hear

876
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,120
 from some of the stories that are just taking place

877
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,240
 from our friends in Fort Worth on a night like this,

878
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,120
 where they are transitioning.

879
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,960
 So you guys check out these videos, this video.

880
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,780
 (soft music)

881
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:44,080
 - We were addicted to self-pleasure.

882
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,240
 - We were trying to earn our worth through athletics.

883
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,760
 - We're emotional and physical abusers of women.

884
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,600
 - Rebellious.

885
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,440
 - Partiers.

886
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,560
 perfection. We manipulated others. Starving for attention. Drowning in

887
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,480
 pornography and lust. We were addicted to pornography. We were crushed by disease,

888
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,280
 feeling hopeless, worthless, and forgotten. Consumed by alcohol. Hiding from community.

889
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,840
 Sought to numb the pain. Lost in abusive relationships. People pleasers who

890
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,740
 thought we needed to perform for God. Obsessed with self-worth. Consumed by worldly

891
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,920
 success. Numb to the gospel. We were self-righteous hypocrites. We were broken.

892
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,920
 Broken. Broken. We were broken. Broken. We were broken. Then Christ. And then Christ

893
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,480
 rewrote the desires of my heart. Then Christ showed me that there is healing

894
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,720
 from addiction. Then Christ used total strangers to remind me just how

895
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,160
 worthwhile I was in His eyes. And then Christ showed me real freedom. Christ

896
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,880
 showed me I am valued. Loved me fully. Filled my life with purpose. He set me

897
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,640
 free. Then Christ showed me where real fulfillment is found. Then Christ revealed

898
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,540
 a transformative love for the first time. Now Christ has given us hope. My sins no

899
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,800
 longer define me. So come and see. Come and be. Come and see. Come and serve. Come and

900
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,040
 love. Come and see. Come and see. Come and see. Not our church, but our Jesus.

901
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:11,880
 Man, that's just a handful of some of the... Can we clap for that? Of some of the stories that

902
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,240
 God has just been writing here. Not because of the porch. The porch doesn't write stories.

903
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,940
 Jesus writes stories. The porch doesn't change anybody's life. Jesus changes lives. He's

904
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,640
 doing it in lots of places. Lots of churches. Lots of places He's at work. In

905
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,280
 a lot of places He's not. But in the places that He is, they're all doing the

906
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,040
 same thing. There's no silver bullet. If you want to experience change, it's gonna

907
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
 involve you living in community. Living out God's Word and living by His Spirit.

908
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,160
 I want to make sure, and I'm gonna close with this, I want to make sure that I

909
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,320
 communicate really clearly. God is not saying, "Change first and then I will

910
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:54,640
 love and accept you." God is saying, "I love and accept you. And if you accept me, I am

911
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,920
 going to bring about change in your life because I'd love you too much to leave

912
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,960
 you that way." And if you're a follower of Jesus, He is doing that. Or you are

913
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,720
 silencing the voice of God. But He's a God who's there saying, "Man, I love you so

914
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,800
 much. Not change and you're accepted. I accept you way before you ever change." I

915
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,960
 have a friend who was going through the adoption process, and I'll close here.

916
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,880
 She was a single girl and she was looking to adopt. And really, this

917
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,000
 happened with a couple friends that were going through adoption processes. And

918
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,360
 they were sharing about the adoption process. And they all shared that there

919
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,320
 was one part of it that was so hard. And it wasn't what I would have expected

920
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,320
 them to say. They were like, "If you adopt, it takes a lot of

921
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,440
 money and it takes a lot of time. It's like weeks at a time. There's interviews,

922
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,840
 people come to your house, all kinds of hard things." That's what I would have

923
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,080
 expected. They said, "No, no, the hardest thing by far is the questionnaire."

924
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,200
 "Questionnaire?" They fill out this questionnaire. They have everyone who

925
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,200
 wants to adopt, and they have to go through. And it asks questions that just

926
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,080
 are hard to answer. Because they're questions around like, "What are the

927
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,920
 boundaries of your acceptance?" If the child's blind, will you accept her?

928
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,640
 Him or her? If the child has a mental disability, are you willing to accept

929
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,360
 them? If the child has a physical disability, are you willing to accept

930
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,640
 them? If so, which ones? If the child has a terminal illness, are you willing to

931
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,560
 accept them? And it goes through over and over and over again and lays out what the

932
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,240
 criteria under which they're willing to accept. Billy, you want to hand me the

933
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,200
 manual? You guys just talk amongst yourselves real quick. And Travis, am I

934
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,080
 good? Check, check. I've been wanting to get rid of this pink kind of headphone

935
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,840
 thing anyways. Anyways, you go through the boundaries of acceptance, and they say

936
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,720
 like, "Hey, these are the ones I'm accepting." Here's why they said it was so

937
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,880
 hard. It's so interesting. They said every box that you check, you're

938
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,320
 essentially telling a child they have one less home that they could go to.

939
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,720
 You're putting parameters on the boundaries of what you're willing to

940
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,720
 accept someone. Boundaries on the willingness that you have to adopt that

941
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,240
 someone. When God looked at you, when God looked at the human race, here's what I

942
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,640
 want to make sure you hear me really loud and clear on. He said, "There are no

943
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,960
 boundaries to my acceptance." There's not a person in the room with a story that

944
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,760
 is too far out, that has done too much, that is too bad of a person, that has

945
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,680
 wrecked their lives too poorly. To be a candidate for my grace, to be a candidate,

946
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,000
 to be someone that I'm going to adopt, that I want to adopt, that I want to

947
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,640
 bring about radical change inside of their life, I will accept them regardless

948
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,000
 of their story. There is no boundaries to my acceptance. That's what God has said.

949
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,480
 Every person in this room who's addicted to pornography, who has pornography in

950
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,960
 their past, who's a manipulator, you're a womanizer. There's guys in this room who

951
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,360
 are womanizers. There's women in this room. There's an abortion in your

952
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,960
 past you never told anyone about. And the God who's there is not angry at you. He's

953
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,880
 crazy about you. He loves you so much you died for you on a cross to

954
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,840
 communicate that to you. To say there is no boundaries to my love, to my

955
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,040
 acceptance, to those who I will adopt and make my children. I don't know what your

956
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,600
 story is in the room, but if you're sitting there, and this happens so often

957
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,400
 where the person's like, "Man, you just don't know my story." You really think

958
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:22,160
 you're the one exception? You must be new here. Because the stories, candidly, just

959
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,760
 of the people that lead around here, are stories of people with incredibly

960
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,360
 broken pasts. People with brokenness where we're still saying, "God, take my

961
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,400
 life. Help me, Lord. Take ground in my heart. I want to be more of God's man."

962
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,920
 Whatever is in front of you right now, whatever you've never shared with anyone,

963
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,000
 or whatever you feel like is owning you, I want you to know change is possible.

964
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,400
 There's a Savior who loves you, who gave himself for you, who has placed no

965
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,680
 boundaries on his acceptance of you. And yet, like any good parent, if he adopts

966
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,560
 you into his family by faith, by trusting in him, he's gonna do what good parents

967
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,720
 do. They raise their kids. They bring about change and growth. And that's what

968
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,560
 he's gonna do in your life. And if he does it, he's gonna do it in these three

969
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,640
 ways, with his people, his spirit, and applying his word. There is no boundaries

970
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,880
 to his acceptance and no boundaries to what he wants to do in your life if you

971
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:28,600
 will let him. And the chance is yours tonight. From the God who's there, who

972
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,640
 knows everything wrong with you, and says, "Man, will you surrender that to me? Walk

973
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:44,240
 with my people, and you'll experience freedom, change, life, hope." Let me pray.

974
00:42:44,240 --> 00:43:03,640
 Father, thank you just for the ways that you're at work, God. It's undeniable for

975
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,160
 so many of us who are not perfect, but we're just experiencing that there's a

976
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,520
 God who loves us enough to convict, to move us towards repentance, to confess.

977
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:23,880
 Thank you for the fact that no story in this room is over, because there's hope

978
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:32,400
 with you. And as we've said before, hope has a name, Jesus. I pray for in this room

979
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:40,640
 the man or woman right now who's scared. They're carrying something candidly. They

980
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,160
 think they're gonna die with. They're gonna carry this to their grave. They'll

981
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,120
 never tell anyone that you would, in your kindness and grace, just move them towards

982
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,760
 sharing with whoever they trust around them, whether it's one of our volunteers,

983
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,080
 somebody around them who'd love to just pray with, come alongside, or someone

984
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,280
 that they know is a follower of Jesus. That they'd be willing to just say, "Man, this is

985
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,600
 the baggage, or this is some of the guilt and shame I'm carrying." And then into

986
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:10,040
 that guilt and into the sin of our life, your grace would run deeper, and you

987
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:17,160
 would grab more of us. We'd experience more of you, more of your love, and we

988
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,720
 would look more like Jesus. God, would you chip away everything that doesn't look

989
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,120
 like him and do something marvelous with the men and women in front of me? For

990
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,120
 your name and your glory, would you kill the pride in my heart, God? Would you help

991
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:40,200
 me? Would you help us all? In Christ's name, amen.
