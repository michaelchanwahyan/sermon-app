00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:30,960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,120
 What's up, guys?

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,620
 What's up, friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth, Houston,

5
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,200
 El Paso, Northwest Arkansas, the Loft, Chapel,

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,520
 wherever you are tuning in from.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,400
 We are continuing the series Matchmaker.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,480
 And if you're curious, we have not started a new dating app.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,280
 It's all just a play off of dating apps.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,040
 Let me start tonight by bringing you guys

11
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,200
 in a little bit of my world.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,800
 As I've mentioned before, I have a four-year-old son

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,720
 and a two-year-old daughter, four-year-old son,

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,240
 into two things really primarily right in his life--

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,440
 superheroes and dinosaurs.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,280
 That's just all we're about all the time, all day long.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,360
 One of the ways that his superhero fascination plays out

18
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,720
 is he is also into superhero LEGO sets.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
 You guys remember LEGOs?

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,100
 Anybody play with LEGOs as a kid?

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,200
 Yeah, they're still around, still doing fine.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,160
 Couple of things I've realized about LEGOs--

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,440
 number one, how much pain my dad must

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,880
 have gone through when he was putting together the LEGO sets.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
 In hindsight, I always remember trying to do it,

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,320
 but I've realized this is a 500-person LEGO set

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,280
 that my son has.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,200
 He has no ability to put this thing together,

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,840
 so it's like I'm doing Ikea furniture on a very small scale

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
 all the time with him.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,760
 This is one of his LEGO sets.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,400
 Captain America and Hawkeye.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,440
 And we'll put this thing together,

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,680
 and he's all about it.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,160
 The other thing I've realized is LEGOs are way more expensive

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
 than you ever remember as a kid.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,280
 And when you're falling on a budget, man, these things

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,880
 are not cheap.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,760
 But all that to say, this is one of the things

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,200
 that we'll, time to time, hang out, put them together,

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
 and we'll work together to put them together.

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,440
 Because he's four, he will often lose the instructions

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,080
 that come with this thing.

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,560
 And this is a 500-piece, little, tiny set.

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,040
 So if you do not have the instructions,

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,520
 you are up a creek with one exception.

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,480
 You have the picture on the box to work with and try

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,240
 to figure out, how do I put this thing together?

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,720
 So because, again, like he's four, it just will disappear.

50
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,560
 It gets thrown away.

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,160
 I don't have the instructions, and I'm

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,200
 sitting there with him trying to put it together,

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
 but I do have the picture.

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,440
 So I get all the ingredients, and I'm looking at it,

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,740
 and I'm going, oh, this is how it works,

56
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,200
 and this is how it goes together,

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,320
 and I can continue to put it together.

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,040
 What does that have to do with dating?

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,720
 Well, it may surprise you, or it may not.

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,400
 The Bible, when it comes to the topic of dating,

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,320
 has very little, or actually nothing, to say.

62
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,000
 Dating is a relatively new invention.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,960
 It's only 75 to 100 years old.

64
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,680
 And so just like the Bible doesn't talk about Netflix

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,400
 and Instagram, it doesn't talk about dating.

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
 But it has a lot to say about marriage,

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,520
 about the type of person you want to be married to,

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,560
 the type of marriage that you want to have,

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
 the type of spouse to not look for,

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,080
 and the type of spouse to look for.

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,160
 And it tells us what God says is the point of marriage

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,440
 and what a successful marriage looks like.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,060
 It gives us the picture.

74
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,800
 And from that, we then take the truths from God's word,

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,200
 and we begin to put together all the different ways

76
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,680
 to build that marriage.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,460
 So tonight, what I want to do is I want to look at,

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,560
 if you will, the way that just like in this Lego set,

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,480
 man, we don't have the instructions,

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,960
 but I have the picture, and I work from there,

81
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,600
 and I can put it together.

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,120
 We don't have the instructions exactly

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,480
 on everything related to dating, but we have the picture

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,200
 which allows us to take the principles and go,

85
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,420
 man, we can put together what God says

86
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,880
 is what marriage is supposed to look like

87
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
 and who you are supposed to marry.

88
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,520
 We're continuing this series, Matchmaker.

89
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,560
 We've spent like two weeks on singleness.

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
 Weeks ahead, we're gonna talk about marriage.

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,280
 Tonight, we are talking about that season in between

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,840
 known as dating and what it looks like to put together

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,520
 the type of marriage that God says, in his word,

94
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,620
 is the picture we are to pursue.

95
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,000
 So we're gonna look and really explore

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,960
 what it looks like to date well.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,420
 If you're following along, we've, in this entire series,

98
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,960
 played off of dating apps, and so we did

99
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,520
 your profile week one, we did your search history.

100
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,180
 This is not a advertisement to do dating apps.

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,240
 We're just playing off that idea

102
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,080
 because increasingly common is people being on dating apps.

103
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,160
 And tonight, we are talking about finding your match.

104
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,500
 If you take notes, it's finding your match.

105
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,400
 We are talking about the subject

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,100
 or everything that entails going on dates,

107
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,080
 what does it look like to date God's way

108
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,060
 and be in a dating relationship God's way.

109
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,960
 So we're gonna look at when to begin to date

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
 or when to match, if you will,

111
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,160
 who to match with and how to match.

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,640
 So I'm gonna fly through that, or another way of saying it

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,620
 would be when to date, who to date, and how to date.

114
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,740
 I'm gonna fly through the first two,

115
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,320
 relatively quick, famous last words,

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,980
 and then we'll camp on the third one.

117
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,560
 But this is a crucial, crucial topic

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,360
 that we live in a world where so many people

119
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,560
 are carrying around scars and pain

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,240
 because of the problems that they have experienced

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,840
 related to not doing what we're gonna talk about tonight.

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,960
 Well, next to who you will worship and who will be your God,

123
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,660
 who will be your match or your mate

124
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,000
 is the biggest decision that you will make.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,300
 And my heart and our heart for this series

126
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,640
 is that you would experience the picture of marriage

127
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,240
 that God says in his word.

128
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,840
 But in order to get there,

129
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,120
 you gotta go through the dating process,

130
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,200
 which is involved of the type of marriage you're gonna have.

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
 So tonight we are talking about dating.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,040
 So first idea, if you take notes, when to match.

133
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,440
 As in like, when is it appropriate

134
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,880
 or when do you begin to start the season of dating?

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,240
 Because you may be thinking, what do you mean?

136
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
 When do I start?

137
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,520
 Could there even be a wrong time to start?

138
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,260
 I start whenever I find a girl who I think is so attractive

139
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,620
 and she's somewhat interested in me

140
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,820
 and we're gonna make this thing happen.

141
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,660
 That's when you start.

142
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,820
 What do you mean, when do you start?

143
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,780
 Incorrect.

144
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,400
 When you start dating involves two things.

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,700
 When you are fully committed to Christ,

146
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,180
 I'm gonna talk about exactly what I mean by that.

147
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,700
 And when you are ready to fully commit to someone.

148
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,780
 When you are fully committed to Christ,

149
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,540
 when you are ready to fully commit.

150
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,580
 What I mean by when you're fully committed to Christ,

151
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,280
 if you just, man, maybe you just came back to your faith

152
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,380
 and you're like, dude, I've been running and I'm back.

153
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,260
 I love what's going on.

154
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,240
 God's working in my life.

155
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,500
 But there's some scars you've never, you haven't dealt with.

156
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,340
 You haven't worked through.

157
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,180
 And like we talked through the past couple of weeks,

158
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,500
 this may not be the best time for you to start dating.

159
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,520
 You should start pursuing the first

160
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,000
 and most important relationship that you have,

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,220
 which is your relationship with Christ.

162
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,140
 You should make sure that is the solid foundation

163
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,500
 you're gonna build a relationship with someone else on.

164
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,860
 'Cause you will never get a relationship

165
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,860
 with a guy or girl right,

166
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,300
 if you don't first have the relationship with God right.

167
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,220
 If you're not in a place where you are fully committed

168
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,660
 or healthy and spiritually mature and ready to date,

169
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,260
 you do not need to be dating.

170
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,360
 Maybe you just got out of a relationship where,

171
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,420
 man, it was everything.

172
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,260
 It was a train wreck.

173
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,860
 And it ended in a way that you're still kind of

174
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,220
 picking up the pieces of your own heart.

175
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,940
 This is not the season for you to date.

176
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,100
 It's a season for you to heal.

177
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,580
 If you're not fully committed to Christ,

178
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,420
 and that's the priority of your life,

179
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,580
 the first thing you gotta get in order is that,

180
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,200
 or you're not ready to begin to date.

181
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,180
 Underneath that would be the idea

182
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,100
 of just being complete in Christ.

183
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,940
 There's so many young adults who they spend their 20s

184
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,580
 and they go from one relationship to the next,

185
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,460
 the next, the next,

186
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,420
 and you don't know what it's like

187
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,140
 to not have a dating relationship.

188
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,980
 And I just want you to ask yourself,

189
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,420
 especially if you look in the rear view mirror

190
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,580
 and it's kind of one train wreck

191
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,140
 after the next, after the next.

192
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,340
 Are you okay being single?

193
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,700
 Is there something a part of you where you're like,

194
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,300
 I don't feel like I'm complete

195
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,920
 without somebody else in my life.

196
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,180
 My relationship status is like my identity.

197
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,820
 I have to be with somebody.

198
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,060
 And it could be that because you're not okay not dating,

199
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,860
 you're not ready to date.

200
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,820
 In other words, if you can't not date,

201
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,260
 you probably should not date.

202
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,380
 And that's not just some tweetable thing.

203
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,580
 It is a truth that if you're not in a place where,

204
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,140
 hey, regardless of who I'm locked arms with,

205
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,980
 I'm holding hands with,

206
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,580
 I'm spending the weekend with,

207
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,380
 or spending my time with,

208
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,540
 my first relationship,

209
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,820
 and I'm okay whether I have someone or not

210
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,460
 because I have him,

211
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,900
 then you're not ready.

212
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,380
 So not just being fully committed to Christ,

213
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,300
 but you are ready to fully commit.

214
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,640
 Now this is gonna blow everybody's mind.

215
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,480
 You're gonna think I'm lying.

216
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,320
 We're gonna get somebody emailing,

217
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,700
 "No, I can't believe you said that."

218
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,920
 When you are not at a place

219
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,580
 where marriage is on the horizon,

220
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,300
 where you could actually get married,

221
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,200
 you should not be dating.

222
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,920
 I'm not saying you have to be able to get married tomorrow.

223
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,780
 Like, hey, if you're not ready to get married tonight,

224
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,540
 right now, you shouldn't get married.

225
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,020
 That's not what I'm saying.

226
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,940
 I'm saying, hey, if you're going,

227
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,460
 there is no ifs, ands, or buts.

228
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,340
 There's no way in the next 18 months I am getting married.

229
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,500
 I gotta finish grad school.

230
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,480
 I gotta get out of debt.

231
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,380
 I got some career priorities.

232
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,020
 Whatever those things are, right or wrong,

233
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,140
 if marriage is off the table,

234
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,900
 dating should be off the table for you.

235
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
 You were not meant to go in long relationships

236
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,260
 with someone else and mend your heart together

237
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,220
 for years and years and years.

238
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,060
 And some of you guys, man,

239
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,960
 you've been dating for like eight years.

240
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,740
 Some of you guys have been dating

241
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,900
 since like your freshman year in high school,

242
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
 and you're 26.

243
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,900
 That's like 11 years.

244
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,540
 There are kids in middle school today

245
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,160
 as old as your dating relationship.

246
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,000
 Think about that.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,020
 You need to, I can't even use that gesture,

248
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,560
 but get off the pot.

249
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,500
 Make a decision.

250
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,100
 You're not made to be in this relationship

251
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,000
 where your hearts are just connected,

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,100
 and temptation is only gonna increase and increase.

253
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,200
 So if you're not at a place

254
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
 where you are ready to fully commit,

255
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,260
 you should not be dating.

256
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,560
 Jesus says this in Luke chapter 12,

257
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,860
 where he says, "Look, if you can't finish what you start,

258
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,060
 "you should not start it."

259
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,420
 Dating, as we've said, is the process

260
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,140
 or the path to move towards marriage.

261
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,220
 That's what Christians believe dating.

262
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,700
 That's what Christian dating is.

263
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,300
 It's not playing for casual fun.

264
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,380
 It's playing for keeps.

265
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,220
 And so it's a process by which I move from evaluating,

266
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,300
 is this a person I want to move

267
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,780
 and progress towards marriage with?

268
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,380
 That's what dating is.

269
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,700
 You should not start it if you cannot finish it.

270
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,880
 He says this, Luke chapter 12, verse 28, 14, sorry.

271
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,980
 Luke chapter 14, verse 28.

272
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,480
 Suppose one of you wants to build a tower.

273
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,540
 Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost

274
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,560
 to see if you have enough money to complete it?

275
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,860
 For if you lay the foundation

276
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,800
 and you're not able to finish it,

277
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,640
 everyone who sees it will ridicule you,

278
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,900
 saying this person began to build

279
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,080
 and he wasn't able to finish it.

280
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,540
 Jesus' principle and point there

281
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,300
 relates to dating in that you should not start

282
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,860
 what you are not willing to finish.

283
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,100
 I'm not saying you have to know

284
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,780
 that that person is who you're gonna marry right now.

285
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,380
 I'm saying if marriage is off the table

286
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,160
 in the near future for you, 18 months or less,

287
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,220
 you should not be dating.

288
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,500
 You're messing with your heart.

289
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,700
 You're just gonna increase sexual temptation.

290
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,040
 So you should make the decision.

291
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,200
 Man, I'm open to that.

292
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,580
 We may not get there, but I'm not just saying

293
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,060
 I'm gonna date for the next four years.

294
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
 It's foolish.

295
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,900
 In Proverbs chapter 24, verse 27, it says this.

296
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,820
 Put your outdoor work in order.

297
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,580
 Get your fields ready.

298
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,300
 After that, build your house.

299
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,460
 In other words, get your business in order

300
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,500
 and then make the decision,

301
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,980
 I'm going to begin to build my home.

302
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,060
 If you're not ready to build your home

303
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,220
 or you don't have your stuff in order

304
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,260
 in a way that you're like,

305
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,980
 man, I could actually see myself getting married,

306
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,820
 you should not be dating.

307
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
 As I said, if marriage is off the table,

308
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,680
 dating should be.

309
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,580
 This past week, I experienced an illustrator

310
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,780
 or really a reflection in this in my own life.

311
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,660
 Anyone familiar with Zillow in here?

312
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,940
 Zillow is like something you do with houses,

313
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,580
 find rent, you find different places.

314
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,500
 Zillow used to have this thing called Make Me Move.

315
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,520
 What is Make Me Move?

316
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,820
 You could list your house on there

317
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,900
 and it would be for people who are like,

318
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,100
 I'm not really interested in selling my house,

319
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,540
 but if you give me this, we'll move.

320
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,620
 They took it down and my old house used to be on that

321
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,340
 and so I went this week just kind of out of curiosity

322
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,580
 and maybe boredom and probably something mentally wrong.

323
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
 And I was like, man, I'm gonna put it back on Make Me Move.

324
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,300
 Found out Zillow doesn't do Make Me Move anymore.

325
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,420
 So I was like, no big, I'll just throw my house

326
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,700
 on the market and put on there in all caps,

327
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,780
 this is Make Me Move,

328
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,720
 even though Zillow doesn't do this anymore.

329
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,780
 And my wife came home and I was like,

330
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,060
 hey babe, I threw a house on the market.

331
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,860
 She's like, you put a house on the market?

332
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,460
 Yeah, I mean, we're not actually gonna do it,

333
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,540
 but if somebody wanted to buy it like at that,

334
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,100
 I mean, they buy it for that.

335
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,660
 Babe, we'll move, we'll figure it out, okay?

336
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,900
 She's like, that's the most impulsive thing

337
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,740
 I've ever in my life.

338
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,820
 I was like, ouch, number one.

339
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,340
 Two, just trying to get you a place you love

340
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,740
 and just blame it on them.

341
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,620
 That's what I result to whenever, no.

342
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,060
 Anyways, I wouldn't even think it.

343
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,020
 I was like, man, nothing's gonna happen with this.

344
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,580
 My phone has been nonstop ringing for the last seven days

345
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,500
 with people saying, hey, we'd like to come by,

346
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,380
 we'd like to see if we'd like to do a little bit of,

347
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,440
 it's the most inconvenient, foolish, what was I thinking?

348
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,460
 Why would I put my house on the market

349
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,060
 when we ain't planning to move?

350
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,260
 Why would you put yourself on the market

351
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,660
 if you ain't planning to marry?

352
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,860
 And so you should not be putting yourself on a dating app

353
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,740
 if you're not at a place, if it's off the table,

354
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,140
 you should not be dating.

355
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,320
 Because when to date is when you are ready

356
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,740
 to move in the direction of marriage.

357
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,600
 And if you're like, look, I can't do 18 months,

358
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,420
 I could do 19 months, fine, at least tell yourself

359
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,980
 what is the number that you're waiting for

360
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,620
 or tell the person that you're with.

361
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,620
 You're like, look, hey, I gotta finish grad school,

362
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,460
 I got three more years,

363
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
 so I'm going to make you wait three more years.

364
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,260
 I just wanna be abundantly clear about that

365
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,620
 and make sure they're okay with that.

366
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,860
 But you better watch out because three years

367
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,180
 of you growing in intimacy and hormones flaring,

368
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,340
 you were not made to do that.

369
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,800
 So when to date, first one, really quickly.

370
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,420
 Second one, who to match with,

371
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,860
 or the first one, when to match, who to match with.

372
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,580
 You need to know who you're looking for

373
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,700
 and specifically there are three characteristics

374
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,060
 that Bible talks about as it relates to a husband and wife

375
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,140
 of who you should be looking for.

376
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,300
 So these three would be,

377
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,620
 hey, this is a potential candidate.

378
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,100
 If they don't have these characteristics,

379
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,380
 they are not a potential candidate.

380
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,380
 The first one, they are a Christ follower.

381
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,220
 They love Jesus.

382
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,060
 Not they are a Christian, not they were raised in church,

383
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,820
 not they believe in God, they love Jesus.

384
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,300
 Listen to this verse from Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:39.

385
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,900
 She or he is free, he's talking about marriage and singles.

386
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,420
 They're free to marry anyone they wish,

387
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,540
 but only if he loves the Lord

388
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,460
 or only if she loves the Lord.

389
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
 Paul says, hey, look, here's the criteria.

390
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,980
 If they don't have this characteristic,

391
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,140
 marriage is off the table.

392
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,600
 They should not marry that person.

393
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,400
 Not they like the Lord, not that they grew up in church.

394
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,380
 If they don't love the Lord,

395
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,700
 you are not free to marry them, Paul would say,

396
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,060
 or you should not marry them.

397
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,420
 Not, it doesn't say if he loves that you love the Lord

398
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,340
 or if he loves or you love the Lord, enough for both of you.

399
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,060
 It doesn't say if someday he may love the Lord

400
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,500
 because you missionary date him

401
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,000
 and try to get him to convert.

402
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,180
 It says only if he or she loves the Lord.

403
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,260
 You should circle that if you write in your Bible,

404
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,140
 you should underline it and highlight it

405
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,460
 and circle it again five more times

406
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,440
 and then put it on your mirror to look at every single day.

407
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,980
 So you know, this is who I'm looking for.

408
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,120
 Only if he or she loves the Lord.

409
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,180
 How do you know if they love the Lord?

410
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,740
 How do you know if somebody loves anything?

411
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,260
 How do you know if somebody loves the Cowboys?

412
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,100
 What do they talk about?

413
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,060
 They're like, oh, them boys, come on, man, Dak, Zeke.

414
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,620
 Oh, dude, this is gonna be our year.

415
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,660
 I'm going to the games.

416
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,500
 They got only 15,000 people there.

417
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,820
 He's spending his time, he's spending his money.

418
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,900
 He's talking about it.

419
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,820
 He can't not.

420
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,300
 He loves them boys.

421
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,140
 If you're not from Dallas,

422
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,580
 you have no idea why I keep talking like them boys.

423
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,540
 That's what he talks about.

424
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,940
 How do you know if somebody loves anything?

425
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,740
 They talk about it, they spend their time,

426
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,580
 they spend their energy, they spend their money.

427
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,260
 They're gonna pursue it and they're gonna talk about it

428
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,260
 and they're gonna be about it no matter who comes with them.

429
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,940
 How do you know if he loves the Lord?

430
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,340
 If you're the person who's dragging him to church

431
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,160
 and you're the person being like,

432
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,100
 hey, how was your quiet time?

433
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,620
 Just keep being your accountability partner.

434
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,620
 If you're the person who is spiritually directing

435
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,800
 their life, they may not love the Lord.

436
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,180
 And you deserve, if you love Jesus,

437
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,860
 command for you and for me,

438
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,620
 and the best shot for the picture of marriage

439
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,900
 God wants to have is you to have someone who loves Jesus.

440
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,620
 This is so important.

441
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,520
 Like this one characteristic.

442
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:54,360
 Because you are picking your future family.

443
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,380
 When you may have heard like the expression of,

444
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,180
 especially when people have like just crazy family members,

445
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,920
 you know, the crazy uncle and there's my sister,

446
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,460
 she's a little off and these are my parents,

447
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,500
 they're a little uncomfortable, but this is it.

448
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,640
 That, hey, you can't pick your family,

449
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,780
 but you can't pick your friends.

450
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
 That's not true.

451
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,260
 You will pick your family.

452
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,360
 When you pick your spouse,

453
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,740
 you need to pick very, very carefully.

454
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,880
 You were picking the father of your children.

455
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,460
 As you navigate dating, think about that.

456
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,580
 You're picking the mother of your children.

457
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,780
 Think about the impact your parents' decision

458
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,460
 when they picked the family that you're a part of

459
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,220
 has had on your life,

460
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,560
 whether for negative ways or for positive ways.

461
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,060
 Some of your greatest things are traced back

462
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,260
 to the fact that your mom,

463
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,700
 I mean, none of us ever think this way

464
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,180
 'cause we think of our parents like they're so old

465
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,620
 and he's got a mustache and he has no hair

466
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,340
 and my dad, he's so weird.

467
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,620
 But your parents, once upon a time,

468
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,260
 it was like, you know, Tom and Barb,

469
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,180
 maybe that's their name.

470
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,140
 It was Tom and Barbara.

471
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,240
 They were driving around in the '70s in his Bronco

472
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,780
 and they were just a lot thinner

473
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,980
 and they were dating together

474
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,260
 and they struggled with like,

475
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,460
 oh, we're snuggling on the couch,

476
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,860
 only watching a giant deep TV.

477
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,540
 And they wrestled with all the things that you wrestle with.

478
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,860
 And maybe your mom saw some red flags

479
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,560
 or maybe your dad saw some red flags or whatever it was,

480
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,460
 they made the decision,

481
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,300
 we're gonna keep moving together and they shouldn't have.

482
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,000
 Or maybe they shouldn't have

483
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,260
 'cause they both weren't solid.

484
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,660
 They didn't love Jesus or maybe one of them did.

485
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,460
 And you can trace a thread of pain in your life

486
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,220
 'cause that marriage fell apart

487
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,300
 because when they were picking their family,

488
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,260
 they didn't use God's criteria for the picture.

489
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,100
 On the flip side,

490
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,780
 some of you guys may have like amazing families

491
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,780
 and your parents are still, you know,

492
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,260
 Tom and Barb and they got the mustache

493
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,060
 and dad's a little whatever,

494
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,660
 but they loved Jesus and they loved you

495
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,020
 and you loved being home

496
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,140
 because they picked their family carefully.

497
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,420
 You cannot be careful enough.

498
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,060
 You are picking your family.

499
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,620
 You're picking your son's daddy.

500
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,380
 You're picking your daughter's mom and dad.

501
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,480
 Choose carefully on who to date.

502
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,380
 The second criteria,

503
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,340
 so there's someone who loves Jesus,

504
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,820
 they're a Christ follower.

505
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,860
 Someone whose character attracts you.

506
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,860
 You may be wondering, you know, attract,

507
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,620
 but they have to be more than just character attracts me.

508
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,460
 Other things attract me.

509
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,420
 I'll touch on that in a second,

510
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,980
 but the Bible says this,

511
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,620
 as it relates to character,

512
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,500
 that's their integrity, that's their trustworthy.

513
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,580
 That is the invisible part of them on the inside

514
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,660
 is that part of what attracts you to them.

515
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,060
 Proverbs chapter 12 said this,

516
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:47,060
 a spouse of noble character is their spouse's crown,

517
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,780
 but a disgraceful wife or husband

518
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,980
 is like decay in his bones.

519
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,260
 It's like it's rotting him from the inside.

520
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,140
 Proverbs 31 verse 10 says,

521
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,140
 a wife or a husband of noble character, who can find?

522
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,100
 She is worth far more than rubies.

523
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,940
 Rubies would have been one of the most extreme,

524
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,880
 exquisite, valuable things you could possess.

525
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,940
 And this man says, far more valuable than that,

526
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,700
 than any riches, any amount that you make

527
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,720
 or your future husband or wife makes

528
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 is their character, is part of what attracts you to them,

529
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,860
 your character.

530
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,220
 First Peter chapter three talks about two types of beauties.

531
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,660
 There's an outer beauty and an inner beauty.

532
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,500
 And Peter basically says,

533
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
 make sure you are marked and they are marked

534
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,060
 by an inner beauty.

535
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,380
 The reason this is so important

536
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,060
 is as hot as that person is right now.

537
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,900
 And I know there's, man,

538
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,620
 there's just beautiful people all over the room

539
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,940
 and in the loft and stage two and in the chapel,

540
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,820
 and they're here tonight.

541
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,380
 And you're like, dude, but she's so hot.

542
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,780
 You know, she's like a four character,

543
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,540
 but she's a 10 and you can, you know,

544
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,940
 you can get better character.

545
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,800
 You can't get better body, if you know what I'm saying.

546
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,920
 And that's how you think about it.

547
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,220
 And you are setting yourself up for a lot of pain

548
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,560
 because that four character and 10 body

549
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,680
 becomes a 10 honeymoon sex, but a four marriage.

550
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,440
 And the Bible teaches,

551
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,840
 you want to find someone who is character.

552
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,680
 Studies have shown that the importance or the impact

553
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,540
 and even the magneticness of infatuation

554
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,000
 and external and physical attraction,

555
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,480
 it fades within 18 months.

556
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,560
 Think about that.

557
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,000
 Like 18 months is how did you think they are?

558
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,800
 And then how does you think you think she is?

559
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,360
 And just, wow, we're so in it together.

560
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,200
 But that can only last about 18 months.

561
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,920
 So if that's all your relationship is built on,

562
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,840
 that's all the time.

563
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,640
 Even secular studies would say,

564
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,020
 it's the only amount it's gonna last.

565
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,300
 This is why when you look at like celebrities

566
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,640
 who are married to supermodels or, you know,

567
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,940
 celebrity girls married, I guess, supermodel guys,

568
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,840
 they end up having an affair.

569
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,560
 And you're like, you were married

570
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,640
 to one of the most beautiful women on the planet.

571
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,960
 According to like the world, how did you cheat on her?

572
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,200
 It's because that fades.

573
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,000
 All that, wow, that doesn't last.

574
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,500
 So a relationship that is built on that will not last.

575
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,860
 So you should look for someone who is a follower of Christ,

576
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,640
 who today character marks their life.

577
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,960
 And then finally, someone who you enjoy being with,

578
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,480
 the third C, a lifelong companion.

579
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,160
 One of the words the Bible uses to describe husband

580
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,240
 and wife and spouse is the word halep.

581
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,800
 Proverbs chapter 2, 17 is one of the examples of this.

582
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 The word halep is a word for best friend.

583
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,640
 Marriage is a friendship.

584
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,800
 Lots of marriage is just ordinary moments together.

585
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,560
 Do you enjoy being together?

586
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,760
 Do you actually enjoy being around one another?

587
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,600
 Or is it uncomfortable?

588
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,800
 Like marriage, it's not just one like long sex debate.

589
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,920
 There's a lot of like, oh yeah, just sitting on the couch,

590
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,440
 you're reading a book, catching up about your day.

591
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,840
 And oh, how did that go?

592
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,040
 It's a lot of ordinary moments.

593
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,640
 Do you actually enjoy them?

594
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,360
 The word the scripture says.

595
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,580
 Do you see them like as a friend?

596
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,060
 Or is it just, man, the make out sessions are really great,

597
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,480
 but we really don't like each other.

598
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,320
 I really don't enjoy being with them that much.

599
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,700
 Because you're gonna spend a lot of time together.

600
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,200
 Are they someone that you enjoy being with?

601
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,800
 So they have character, they're a Christ follower,

602
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,380
 and they could be a lifelong companion.

603
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,760
 You notice I didn't say anything about someone

604
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,280
 you are physically attracted to.

605
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,040
 And I didn't for a couple reasons.

606
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,240
 Number one, no matter what I say about,

607
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,400
 hey, should or should you not be physically attracted

608
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,960
 to that person, you're not gonna listen, okay?

609
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,320
 Because you're gonna do whatever you're gonna do,

610
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,080
 and you're gonna be either it really matters to you

611
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,200
 or it doesn't really matter to you.

612
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,880
 So if I brought that up, it's not like anyone to be like,

613
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,480
 oh, hey, and you should be physically attracted to them.

614
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,240
 Like anyone would be like, really?

615
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,720
 Oh my, physically attract, I enjoy how they look.

616
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,560
 I had no idea.

617
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,880
 I was in danger of marrying.

618
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,280
 Sorry.

619
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,600
 I was gonna say a name which would not help me,

620
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,000
 and I would not be talking about anyone specific.

621
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,040
 So that's one reason.

622
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,680
 And two, because no matter where you came in

623
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,920
 and however important it is to you,

624
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
 it's as important as it should be,

625
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
 or not as it should be, as it is to you.

626
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
 It shouldn't be the most important thing in your life

627
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,860
 and that you look for.

628
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,220
 So when it follows Christ, who is character,

629
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,360
 and can be a lifelong companion,

630
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
 those are the who to look for

631
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,980
 and the characteristics that you should be looking for.

632
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,820
 It's like this.

633
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,120
 Like I mentioned earlier,

634
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,320
 I'm just talking about my kids' games today.

635
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,780
 My son also loves dinosaurs,

636
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,360
 so he has these like matching games.

637
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,860
 And I thought about trying to explain this game

638
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,200
 without actually doing it,

639
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
 but I knew it would be like,

640
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,240
 "You know that matching card game?"

641
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,600
 And everyone would be like, "You don't have a poker?"

642
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,760
 So it's these games where you have these things

643
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,320
 and they have a match on there,

644
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,120
 and they lay them out and we'll set them down,

645
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,280
 and he just loves the dinosaurs.

646
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,640
 So there's different things that you match them up with.

647
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,520
 And he'll go and he'll look,

648
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,360
 and we've had to teach him like,

649
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,840
 "Hey, you need to look for,

650
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,320
 there's specific characteristics that mark this dinosaur.

651
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,760
 You look and your match is one

652
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,360
 that shares those characteristics,

653
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,140
 not a match, not a match, match."

654
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,340
 That's how you play the game.

655
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,180
 When it comes to dating,

656
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,140
 it's not as simple as you're looking for the person

657
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,500
 to complete you or reflect you

658
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,200
 or be the perfect exactness of you.

659
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,900
 But you're looking for the characteristics

660
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,940
 that God says in his word,

661
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
 then you know you got a match,

662
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,620
 but you've got a potential match.

663
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,980
 There's someone who has character,

664
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,300
 there's someone who follows Christ

665
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,660
 and could be a lifelong companion.

666
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,140
 And let me just address the elephant in the room

667
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,060
 for anybody who's single.

668
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,040
 You're going, "Huh, well, that sounds great.

669
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,920
 Where is this land of a thousand godly men

670
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,020
 and a thousand godly women out there?

671
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,760
 Because I don't know where they are."

672
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,400
 Might I suggest,

673
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,500
 part of the reason that is a challenge

674
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,400
 is where you are looking for your match.

675
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,420
 Like, are you, is the,

676
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,600
 some of the places where you're finding your relationships,

677
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,500
 is it at the bar?

678
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,380
 Is it the club?

679
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,220
 Is it on Tinder?

680
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,380
 Is it on like some friend group

681
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,600
 of sorority sisters from college?

682
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,900
 They're not following Jesus.

683
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,160
 Is that where you're meeting your potential options?

684
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,520
 Or are you connected to a local church?

685
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,220
 Are you plugged into a young adult ministry like this one?

686
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,440
 Are you plugged into environments

687
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,220
 where godly people are gonna be around?

688
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,120
 Because if not, I'm not the smartest guy in the world,

689
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
 but that might be a good option

690
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,420
 for you to meet other godly people,

691
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,400
 if you're a godly person.

692
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,240
 And people are like, "Man,

693
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,300
 there's just so many fish in the sea

694
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,580
 and I just can't find them.

695
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,380
 And every guy that I end up with is not a great guy."

696
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,540
 It may be that you're swimming in the wrong sea.

697
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,280
 You're swimming in the sewer.

698
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,780
 And you know what's in the sewer?

699
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
 (congregation laughing)

700
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,180
 Fish full of crap.

701
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,760
 (congregation laughing)

702
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,020
 You're swimming in the wrong sewer of dating.

703
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,480
 And you know what's in the wrong sewer of dating?

704
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,780
 Full of crap.

705
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,880
 (congregation laughing)

706
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,900
 You gotta make sure, hey, where are you looking?

707
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,260
 Like, where are you connected?

708
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,500
 Where are you plugged in?

709
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,860
 Are you in environments

710
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,220
 where other godly people are running after Jesus?

711
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,820
 Because as Tommy Nelson famously once said,

712
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,740
 who was a pastor up in Denton,

713
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,020
 he said, "Look, you need to be someone

714
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,140
 who puts yourself in an environment

715
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,780
 where you're running with others alongside of you

716
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,220
 and you're running hard after Jesus

717
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,100
 and you're running and running.

718
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,360
 And eventually, hopefully,

719
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,660
 because you're around other people doing the same,

720
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,580
 you just look over and there she is.

721
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,720
 And you're going, "Man, I like the way she's running

722
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,660
 and the way she looks.

723
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,580
 Do you wanna run together?"

724
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,380
 And you just lock arms and run for the rest of your life.

725
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,820
 Are you around other Christians?

726
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,360
 Do you have that group?

727
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,980
 If not, man, you gotta get connected to a church.

728
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,580
 Gotta get connected to where God's people are.

729
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,900
 Don't assume they're at the ports.

730
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,340
 There's a lot of people that carry a Bible.

731
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,520
 There's a lot of people that look like, you know,

732
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,360
 they know a couple of Bible verses and they're wolves.

733
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,380
 And we know they're even in here.

734
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,860
 So I wouldn't assume anything

735
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,620
 unless you're connected and they're connected

736
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,060
 and you have other people and he's a known person.

737
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,360
 She's a known person.

738
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,260
 Not just someone you met on a Tuesday night here.

739
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,820
 So there's someone who has character,

740
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,820
 following Christ, could be a lifelong companion.

741
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,420
 Number three, and I'm gonna fly through this.

742
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,620
 This is gonna be a fire hydrant.

743
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,980
 I'm gonna move really quick,

744
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,980
 but I'm gonna go through 10 things on how to date.

745
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,620
 I'm gonna move really, really quick through all 10 of them.

746
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,820
 It's gonna be a fire hydrant.

747
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,260
 So these should be up on the screen if you wanna take notes,

748
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,500
 but these are the how to date.

749
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 So call this the rules as it relates to dating.

750
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,660
 Number one on how.

751
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,460
 Guys, ask girls out on dates.

752
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,940
 (congregation cheering)

753
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,660
 Guys, I'm not picking on the guys.

754
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
 And I know the guys in the room

755
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,980
 probably feel like they're getting picked on.

756
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,180
 And I wanna walk through what I mean very specifically.

757
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,380
 Ask them on a date.

758
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,020
 Use the word date.

759
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,300
 Not, you wanna do rock climbing this weekend?

760
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,980
 Not, hey, what do you got going on?

761
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,820
 Anytime soon.

762
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,540
 Not, hey, I'm about to watch a movie.

763
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,420
 You wanna come over?

764
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,060
 Say, I would like to take you on a date.

765
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,700
 And then the second part of, man, this is so huge.

766
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,460
 If you do this, dude, you're gonna be in the top 10%

767
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,180
 of men who've ever lived when it comes to women,

768
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
 because you are gonna set yourself so far apart

769
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,020
 from the pack, which is not that hard to do,

770
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,260
 but you gotta be more specific

771
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,860
 and you've got to drive for clarity.

772
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,460
 And I promise you, you're gonna get married

773
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,340
 and I want credit, I wanna hear about it.

774
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,620
 And if you name your child after me, I'm okay with that.

775
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,180
 Okay, so here we go.

776
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,020
 Be specific, have a plan.

777
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,300
 You're gonna go up to her, you'd say,

778
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
 I would like to take you on a date.

779
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,580
 And then you tell her this Saturday night

780
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,060
 at seven o'clock to dinner, and then this show after.

781
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,100
 You are very specific, you show her you have a plan.

782
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,980
 Women love that, they wanna know you've thought about this,

783
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,700
 and you give her and you communicate,

784
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,420
 you drive clarity into the relationship.

785
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,460
 By doing so, you give her the ability to decide

786
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,540
 and understand what you're asking.

787
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,460
 When you go, hey, you wanna hang on Sunday?

788
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,180
 She doesn't know what you're talking about.

789
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,900
 So she's going, like just me?

790
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,180
 I have a friend?

791
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,740
 And you just slid into my DMs and I don't know who you are.

792
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,740
 No, I don't wanna hang out with you this Sunday.

793
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,020
 Drive clarity and say, hey, very specifically,

794
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,780
 here is the plan.

795
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,400
 By doing so, you give her the ability to evaluate

796
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,340
 what are you asking me to do?

797
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,820
 It also gives her the ability to decide

798
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,580
 something that you have been thinking about

799
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,740
 at least longer than she has.

800
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,580
 'Cause she's getting in the moment,

801
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,420
 you've been thinking about it,

802
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,500
 you've been asking your other guy buddies,

803
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,140
 like here's the plan, I'm thinking about taking Sarah out

804
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,580
 to like Olive Garden, is Olive,

805
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,300
 oh, Olive Garden's bad, okay, no, Olive Garden,

806
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,620
 and you're walking through it,

807
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,700
 you got the whole plan, you go up to her

808
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,100
 and you pop the question and she's like,

809
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,220
 oh, I don't even know what you're asking me to do right now.

810
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,060
 But if you give her specifics,

811
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,220
 she can process the information, process the ask,

812
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,100
 and give you an answer.

813
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,400
 Or say, I'd love to get back to you on that.

814
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,980
 But drive clarity, and if you do this,

815
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,740
 man, I promise you, ladies, am I wrong right now?

816
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,940
 Thank you, there you go.

817
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,740
 Drive clarity in the relationship.

818
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,300
 All right, I gotta keep moving.

819
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,620
 So two more things.

820
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,180
 Can you DM her?

821
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,620
 Sure.

822
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,540
 Is it best?

823
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,220
 No, I'm just gonna speak on behalf of ladies,

824
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,860
 I think I'm right here, in fact, I know I'm right,

825
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,620
 but I'm just gonna say I think, just try.

826
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,540
 Here would be the priority of communication.

827
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,380
 Best option you got, go up to her in person,

828
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,200
 ask her on a date.

829
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,040
 Second best option, call her on the phone.

830
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,820
 Third best option, text and DM,

831
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,140
 which are borderline not a real form

832
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,700
 of human communication, but you do you.

833
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,740
 If you're gonna text or DM, I would DM just to say,

834
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,900
 hey, can I have your number?

835
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,980
 I'd love to ask you a question.

836
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,860
 Then you call her on the phone and you ask her.

837
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,960
 And here's the hard thing, ladies,

838
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,300
 you don't know this about men,

839
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,460
 but we hate being rejected, we hate it.

840
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,560
 And any risk of rejection, we don't wanna do it.

841
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,860
 If we can avoid it, we're going to.

842
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,500
 But men, when it comes to this,

843
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,020
 step up, be courageous, flex that courage muscle,

844
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,460
 and risk getting rejected.

845
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,060
 And if you do, I am so stinking proud of you

846
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,700
 because you did what men do.

847
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,740
 You stood up, you risked rejection,

848
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
 and you should take it as a tattoo on the arm

849
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,780
 that yeah, I got turned down,

850
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,300
 but at least I'm in the game.

851
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,820
 All these other guys are sliding into DMs like,

852
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,740
 yo, you up?

853
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,980
 And I'm over here trying to actually be a man.

854
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,260
 (audience laughing)

855
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
 There you go, all right, number two.

856
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,180
 I gotta keep moving.

857
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,660
 Girls, say yes to dates.

858
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,420
 Pretty 101, yeah, there you go.

859
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,660
 Thank you, gentlemen.

860
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,300
 Girls, say yes to dates.

861
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,180
 This is twofold.

862
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,260
 What do I mean by that?

863
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,380
 Don't say yes to you up,

864
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,040
 don't say yes to rock climbing on Sunday,

865
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,440
 say yes to a date.

866
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,420
 If the guy says you wanna go to brunch,

867
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,500
 you say like as a date?

868
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,140
 You force him to be clear.

869
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,980
 You say yes to dates.

870
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,400
 You are so much more valuable,

871
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,040
 and you should not settle for anything lower than clarity.

872
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,580
 Number two, you should also say yes to men

873
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,660
 who are godly men when they ask you on a date.

874
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,040
 This is my humble opinion.

875
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,300
 You can take it or leave it.

876
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,860
 I think if a godly guy who you know is a godly guy

877
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,960
 asks you on a date,

878
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,880
 you should go on at least a date with him.

879
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,260
 You may be thinking, no, there's no way.

880
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,100
 I never wanna marry him.

881
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,220
 He's hit with the ugly stick.

882
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,380
 You don't know that, and character,

883
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,780
 I'm just kidding, there's no one I'm talking about,

884
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,280
 is the most important part of a person.

885
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,340
 So even going on a date, you'll have a chance to know,

886
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,580
 man, I actually enjoyed being with this person.

887
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,180
 Character is the most important part.

888
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,020
 That's my opinion.

889
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,780
 I would say yes to only dates,

890
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,620
 and I think if a godly guy,

891
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,980
 not the guy that you met at the porch,

892
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,660
 a godly guy that you know is a godly guy

893
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,020
 asks you on a date, I think you should go

894
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,980
 on a date with him.

895
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,760
 Number three, honor them on both sides.

896
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,600
 There's so much just trashing of one another

897
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 in the midst of the process.

898
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,700
 The world has totally gotten this bankrupt.

899
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,740
 People are using and abusing one another

900
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,660
 in the context of dating.

901
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,920
 As Christians, honor each other.

902
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,160
 Flex the honor muscle.

903
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,840
 I'm gonna choose to be considerate

904
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,320
 of how I communicate with you.

905
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,780
 I'm gonna drive clarity.

906
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,840
 If I'm the guy, I wanna be very clear

907
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,520
 about where we are in terms of our relationship.

908
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,340
 I'd like to take you on a second date.

909
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,760
 If you're the girl, and you don't wanna go

910
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,680
 on a second date, then you honor him,

911
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,000
 and you say, I don't wanna go on a second date.

912
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,440
 Thank you for asking me on a second date.

913
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,880
 Thank you for the first date,

914
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,280
 but I'm not interested in going on a second date.

915
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,360
 You're kind, you're polite, you're considerate,

916
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,120
 and you honor one another.

917
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,840
 This means that along the way,

918
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,440
 at some point, you have a DTR.

919
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,120
 That means to find the relationship

920
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,480
 where you don't live in this no man's land

921
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,320
 for a while where you're like,

922
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,800
 you know, what's going on with you and Kevin?

923
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,920
 Oh, you know, I don't really know,

924
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,880
 and you're sitting there with the other person.

925
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,240
 Happens same thing every time.

926
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,920
 The girls are asking the one girl who's dating Kevin,

927
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,440
 and the guys are asking Kevin the same thing,

928
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,840
 and they're like, what's going on with you and Kevin?

929
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,880
 You're like, oh, I don't really know,

930
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,920
 and then she brings it up to Kevin.

931
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,680
 Like, people keep asking, like, what's going on with us?

932
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,560
 And I'm like, I don't really know.

933
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,400
 What would you say?

934
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,320
 And it drives into a DTR.

935
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,720
 Don't ever let it get there.

936
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,160
 Communicate where you are.

937
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,400
 Honor one another.

938
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
 Honor is such a lost value,

939
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,340
 and as Christians, honor one another.

940
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,520
 Don't lead each other on.

941
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,720
 Don't ghost.

942
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,640
 Or disappear and resurface.

943
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,680
 And that's on both sides.

944
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,320
 Guys and girls do the same thing.

945
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,720
 It always feels like we're hitting the guys.

946
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,600
 Dude, some of you girls are shady, man.

947
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,840
 I hear the stories of it.

948
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,940
 (congregation laughing)

949
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,640
 And it's not honoring.

950
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,120
 Yeah, this guy's dated one of you, apparently.

951
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,180
 (congregation laughing)

952
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,400
 But honor one another.

953
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,720
 Oh, man.

954
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,120
 All right, number four.

955
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,000
 I've lost count.

956
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,900
 Expect them to honor you.

957
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,160
 Require it.

958
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,440
 Don't settle if they don't.

959
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,860
 If they do not honor you, if they're disrespectful,

960
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,300
 if they ghost you, if they treat you poorly,

961
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,080
 if they talk down to you, if they are unkind to you,

962
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,000
 break up.

963
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
 You do not stay in a relationship

964
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,180
 that settles for anything less than honor.

965
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,800
 You should honor them, and anyone who dishonors you,

966
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,080
 you get out of that relationship.

967
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,800
 And they're gonna think, oh, man,

968
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,320
 you think you're better than me, you have to break up

969
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,520
 'cause, oh, apparently I'm not as good as you want me to be.

970
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,380
 Yes, you are better than that.

971
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,560
 You deserve better than that.

972
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,000
 You should get out of that relationship.

973
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And any guy who treats you with dishonor

974
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,400
 doesn't just disagree with your perspective

975
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,960
 of you deserve honor, he disagrees with God's,

976
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,880
 or she disagrees with God's,

977
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,520
 who says, you are a child of mine.

978
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,120
 And if you continue, and this, man, this makes me so sad

979
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
 because this happens, what I'm about to say.

980
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,480
 People stay in really dysfunctional, messed up relationships

981
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,920
 and they get disrespected and dishonored and dishonored,

982
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,840
 sometimes 'cause they have codependency problems

983
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,240
 or they just, like, they grew up in a family environment

984
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,880
 where they were disrespected all the time by something,

985
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,460
 but for whatever reason, they stay in there.

986
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,840
 And you know what happens when you do that?

987
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,500
 You begin to think that you are a dishonorable person

988
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,280
 who's not worthy or deserving of honor.

989
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,800
 And you begin to buy the lie

990
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,040
 because God says, man, they're not just disagreeing with you

991
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,920
 when they disrespect you, they're disagreeing with me

992
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,760
 'cause this is who you are.

993
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,000
 In fact, there's a slide we threw up.

994
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,320
 Here's what you are if you are a follower of Jesus.

995
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
 You're someone who's created in God's image.

996
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,880
 Some of you guys can take a screenshot of that.

997
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
 That's the only thing that you needed to hear tonight.

998
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
 This is who I am.

999
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,560
 I'm not gonna settle for any guy or girl

1000
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
 who treats me less than that.

1001
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,840
 I expect, I demand, I won't settle for not being honored.

1002
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,360
 They're not gonna disrespect and ghost me.

1003
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,440
 I'm out.

1004
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,600
 Because if they do, they don't disagree with you,

1005
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,580
 they disagree with God.

1006
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,200
 All right, number five, guard both of your hearts.

1007
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,160
 Guard both of your hearts.

1008
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,040
 I know that's most Christian cliche of all time,

1009
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,840
 but here's what I mean by that.

1010
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,120
 Do not mentally take the relationship

1011
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,120
 farther than verbally you have mutually agreed to.

1012
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,380
 I'll say that again.

1013
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,720
 Do not mentally, as in your mind,

1014
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,920
 take the relationship farther

1015
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,440
 than you have mutually discussed verbally.

1016
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,840
 In other words, if you got on two dates together,

1017
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,740
 here's who you are.

1018
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,680
 You're a two date girl.

1019
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,900
 Don't begin to go through your mind and be like,

1020
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,440
 I'm picking out wedding decorations,

1021
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,680
 I'm saying yes to the dress right now,

1022
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,960
 and I've got it all going.

1023
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,520
 No, you're a two date girl.

1024
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,840
 If he has not said, I want you to be my girlfriend,

1025
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,340
 and I'd like you to marry me, you are a two date girl.

1026
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,220
 And that's okay.

1027
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,180
 Everybody has to be two date girl or two date guy

1028
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,020
 at some point in life.

1029
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,000
 It's part of the dating process,

1030
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,960
 but do not mentally run down that road

1031
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,240
 and begin to territorially on the girl be like,

1032
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,440
 I can't believe that she is not planning

1033
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,800
 to hang out with me on Saturday.

1034
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,560
 You guys went on one date.

1035
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,860
 You went on one date.

1036
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,000
 She can't have the expectation,

1037
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
 or you can't that now every Saturday's yours.

1038
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,440
 That's insane.

1039
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,120
 Do not mentally take the relationship farther

1040
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,520
 than mutually you have talked about

1041
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,100
 or communicated verbally with one another.

1042
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,280
 Guard one another's heart.

1043
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,520
 Biblically, there is not a category for dating.

1044
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
 There's two categories as it relates

1045
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,080
 to people of the opposite sex.

1046
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,820
 You're either their husband or wife,

1047
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,120
 or brother and sister in Christ.

1048
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,080
 Does not recognize anything in between.

1049
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,500
 And so until you move from brother and sister in Christ

1050
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,720
 to husband and wife,

1051
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,120
 and on that path more seriously in engagement,

1052
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,000
 do not take the relationship further

1053
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,480
 than either of you have discussed mentally.

1054
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,600
 Number six, date one person at a time.

1055
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,960
 Feels pretty straightforward,

1056
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,560
 but date one person at a time.

1057
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
 Let me be clear, 'cause some of you guys this week,

1058
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,920
 feel like I'm throwing shade at you

1059
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,640
 'cause you went on a date with a guy from Bumble

1060
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,340
 and then from Hinge, same week.

1061
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,900
 I'm not saying that you can't go on a date with somebody

1062
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,300
 and then decide I'm not interested

1063
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,360
 in going on another date,

1064
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,860
 and it just so happens that I got asked on two in one week,

1065
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,640
 and I haven't been asked on any for six months,

1066
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,680
 but when it rains, it pours,

1067
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,440
 and now I've got multiple dating options.

1068
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,200
 And are you telling me that I am insane

1069
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,080
 if I say yes to both?

1070
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,640
 No, I'm saying if you are dating,

1071
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,780
 going on multiple dates with multiple people,

1072
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,840
 you're not doing what the Bible says

1073
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,520
 in Philippians chapter two,

1074
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,640
 which is being considerate of the persons you're dating.

1075
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,120
 It says, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition,

1076
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,160
 "but with humility of mind,

1077
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,560
 "consider others more important than yourself."

1078
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,760
 So do not date multiple people,

1079
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,760
 go on multiple dates with multiple people at the same time.

1080
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,160
 Number seven, gotta get better at counting, good grief.

1081
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,600
 Number seven, date in community.

1082
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,480
 How to win at dating,

1083
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,440
 how to make sure that you set yourself up for success,

1084
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,360
 date in community.

1085
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,240
 By community, if you've been around here,

1086
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,320
 you hear us talk about it a lot.

1087
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,600
 That means have a small group.

1088
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,520
 That means you, if you're a girl,

1089
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,840
 should have other girls in your life,

1090
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,960
 they hold you accountable.

1091
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,080
 They can talk about your relationship with you.

1092
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,280
 You can go there to process how you're feeling,

1093
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,660
 the emotions that you're having,

1094
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,140
 where you guys are maybe stuck or had a conflict.

1095
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,160
 You have girls in your life.

1096
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,200
 If you're a guy, you have the same group,

1097
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,520
 or you have a group of guys in your life

1098
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,240
 that you can go to and process,

1099
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,200
 and they can hold you accountable in purity.

1100
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,300
 They can hold you accountable

1101
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,200
 in terms of the next steps of leading your girlfriend,

1102
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,640
 and they can be a place that speaks into,

1103
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
 is this a good relationship?

1104
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,240
 Should this continue moving forward?

1105
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,360
 If you don't have a group or a small group

1106
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,620
 or community group here at Watermark or at your church,

1107
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,840
 you should not be dating.

1108
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,960
 The Bible says that plans fail for lack of counselors.

1109
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,440
 You're setting yourself up to be in a relationship

1110
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,240
 where you're all on your own.

1111
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,480
 In olden days, like I think we talked about it before,

1112
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,080
 like there used to be something called arranged marriage.

1113
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,000
 So as crazy as it was, there wasn't a time

1114
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,560
 where you would decide to get married

1115
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,680
 or go through the dating process.

1116
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,840
 Your family and your community decided.

1117
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,960
 Your dad showed up one day and was like,

1118
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,280
 "Hey, Carl, we decided to trade two oxen and a bull

1119
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,160
 "for Carly down the road,

1120
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,640
 "and you guys are getting married on Sunday."

1121
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,600
 And it was like, okay, well, there we go.

1122
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,460
 And that had some pluses and some minuses to it.

1123
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,360
 Today, we've swung in the entire other direction

1124
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,520
 where instead of others in community

1125
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,720
 speaking into who we marry,

1126
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,300
 we make that decision all on our own.

1127
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,720
 And it can be incredibly destructive

1128
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,400
 to make the most important decision next to Jesus.

1129
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,620
 You will make all on your own,

1130
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,280
 just you and them and your heart,

1131
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,380
 because your heart, biblically, can lie to you.

1132
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,520
 It will make you say,

1133
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,180
 "Look, you guys were made for each other.

1134
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,000
 "You have that song together.

1135
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,120
 "This is made to happen."

1136
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,060
 When other people are going,

1137
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,740
 "This is not a good relationship.

1138
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,880
 "Like there's so many red flags.

1139
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,400
 "I'm concerned about you."

1140
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,440
 And it'll make you go, "Just the world's against us

1141
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,400
 "because we're destined lovers

1142
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,840
 "and you have been deceived."

1143
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,260
 Jeremiah 17, verse nine says,

1144
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,000
 "The heart is deceitful above everything else.

1145
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,340
 "It will lie to you."

1146
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,460
 Proverbs chapter three says, "Do not trust in your heart.

1147
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,040
 "Trust the Lord with your heart,

1148
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,280
 "His word and His people."

1149
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,920
 That's what that means.

1150
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,940
 So make sure that you're in community.

1151
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,000
 Number seven or number eight, don't have sex.

1152
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,120
 Pretty straightforward.

1153
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,940
 Why?

1154
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,720
 Because as the coach in "Mean Girls" says,

1155
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,900
 "If you do, you will get pregnant and die."

1156
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,100
 So, move on from there.

1157
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,940
 No, why?

1158
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,100
 Because the Bible says,

1159
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,340
 "And all of us, if you had sex, you've experienced it."

1160
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,740
 Sex is intoxicating.

1161
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,500
 It was made to be that way.

1162
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,940
 It's like putting drunk goggles on.

1163
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,140
 And the way that it is a bad decision to drink and drive

1164
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,180
 is a bad decision to get drunk and sex and date.

1165
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,860
 It will lower your inhibitions

1166
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,320
 and your ability to evaluate.

1167
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,160
 You may be like, "What?

1168
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,120
 "The Bible doesn't say that."

1169
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,860
 Proverbs chapter five says this,

1170
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,520
 "Rejoice in the wife of your youth,

1171
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,460
 "a loving doe, a graceful deer.

1172
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,600
 "May her breast satisfy you always.

1173
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,400
 "May you ever be drunk with her love."

1174
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,940
 Beyonce stole that right out of Solomon's mouth.

1175
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:23,240
 Why, my son, be drunk with another man's wife

1176
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,040
 or with a woman who's not your wife?

1177
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,340
 Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?

1178
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,320
 We've all been there before, right?

1179
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,620
 (congregation laughing)

1180
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,300
 It's saying sex is intoxicating.

1181
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,180
 The reason it's dangerous

1182
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,660
 to bring into a dating relationship

1183
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,600
 is it will lower your inhibitions.

1184
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,940
 You'll stay longer than you should stay.

1185
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,580
 In a relationship where had sex not been introduced,

1186
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,160
 you would have been like, "This just doesn't work."

1187
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,420
 But because it was introduced, it's like,

1188
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,200
 "Man, it was just so tingly when we touched.

1189
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,060
 "We're just on fire."

1190
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,700
 And then eventually it wears off

1191
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,500
 and you find yourself walking through the heartache

1192
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,940
 of a breakup that should have taken place

1193
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,620
 three months in, not three years.

1194
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,740
 Don't have sex.

1195
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,340
 If you have already had sex,

1196
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,900
 you're in this room and you had sex together,

1197
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,540
 you're listening, you've had sex together,

1198
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,900
 you need to repent.

1199
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,260
 It's a really churchy word,

1200
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,460
 but it means, "Man, I'm gonna confess.

1201
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,780
 "I'm gonna bring that into the open.

1202
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,080
 "I'm gonna have accountability in my life.

1203
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,660
 "I'm gonna have, she needs to have,

1204
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,760
 "he needs to have accountability

1205
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,700
 "on both sides in a small group,

1206
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,980
 "and we're gonna set boundaries.

1207
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,160
 "We're gonna seek to do this God's way.

1208
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,380
 "And if you can't keep those boundaries,

1209
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,700
 "you should break up."

1210
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,100
 Number nine, two more.

1211
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,500
 Don't date forever.

1212
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:44,220
 As in, if you have been dating for years and years,

1213
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,340
 what are you waiting for?

1214
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,300
 What more are you trying to figure out?

1215
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,020
 What qualities are gonna push you over the edge?

1216
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,580
 Dating should be not hasty

1217
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,660
 and you shouldn't just meet somebody

1218
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,900
 and be like, "Let's do this."

1219
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,100
 You should evaluate and go through the process

1220
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,020
 because that's what dating is.

1221
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,460
 It's a season for you to decide,

1222
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,100
 is this someone I wanna spend my life with?

1223
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,060
 So there should be evaluation.

1224
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,060
 First Timothy chapter five is basically teachings on,

1225
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,860
 hey, when it comes to an elder,

1226
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,740
 don't be quick to lay hands.

1227
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,580
 And by that, it doesn't mean like throw bows.

1228
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,900
 It means like to put in a position of leadership,

1229
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,340
 which is what an elder is, a leader of the church.

1230
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,140
 Don't be quick to put a new leader

1231
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,900
 in a position of leadership without getting to know them

1232
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,980
 and seeing an extended season of faithfulness

1233
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,940
 and their character.

1234
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,980
 An elder is a leader of the bride of Christ,

1235
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,060
 that's the church.

1236
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,260
 In the same way as it relates to you

1237
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,260
 putting a position or moving towards marriage

1238
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,540
 and having a leader of the bride of you

1239
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,660
 or having a bride to you,

1240
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,720
 you should have a season of evaluating their character

1241
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,860
 with others around you where you can see,

1242
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,420
 I know what I'm getting into here,

1243
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,980
 but it should not be a season that lasts till 2024.

1244
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,220
 If you're in it right now,

1245
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,540
 at some point you gotta go, man,

1246
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,300
 I feel like I know enough.

1247
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,440
 And if you're perpetually dating, you're doing it wrong.

1248
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,980
 Let me say it this way.

1249
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,980
 If you're perpetually dating,

1250
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,980
 you're probably not doing it God's way

1251
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,700
 because dating is not,

1252
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,740
 when you're pursuing purity,

1253
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,240
 when you do everything the scripture says,

1254
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,940
 it's not like the greatest thing ever.

1255
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,100
 It's like, yeah, it's 10 o'clock.

1256
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,940
 I'll see you later.

1257
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,100
 Good to see you, God.

1258
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,900
 Versus marriage where it's two and coming together

1259
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,260
 and marriage is not any better

1260
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,540
 and has its own challenges, but it's amazing.

1261
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,580
 And if you're in a dating relationship,

1262
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,420
 what are you waiting for?

1263
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,940
 How much longer?

1264
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,820
 Because it should not be something

1265
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,780
 where you just are perpetually dating.

1266
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,500
 Finally, don't be afraid to exit.

1267
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,860
 Don't be afraid to exit.

1268
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,300
 Dating is a road, as I started,

1269
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,120
 that is taking you in a path towards a promise,

1270
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,900
 towards a lifelong pursuit.

1271
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,980
 So dating shouldn't be just perpetual,

1272
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,040
 just aimless wandering.

1273
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,900
 It is, hey, we are getting on this thing

1274
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,980
 and we're evaluating as we drive along the road,

1275
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,580
 are we gonna end up the destination of marriage?

1276
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,820
 If along that road, you realize,

1277
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,220
 this is not someone I can marry.

1278
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,020
 This is not someone who I wanna be the father of my children.

1279
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,840
 This is not a godly person.

1280
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,540
 And I love them and I wanna stay.

1281
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,260
 We've had so much emotional capital built.

1282
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,900
 I'm like, I can't even imagine life without them.

1283
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,000
 But I don't think we have the same faith

1284
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,040
 or share the same vision for our future.

1285
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,960
 You gotta exit.

1286
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,040
 Every mile you keep going on that road,

1287
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,080
 it will become harder and harder to take an exit.

1288
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,600
 And as crazy as it sounds,

1289
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,000
 it's not gonna get any easier in the future.

1290
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,560
 If you know it needs to end, you need to end it.

1291
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,800
 And being willing, man, I think we need to break up.

1292
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,120
 Maybe it's the wrong time,

1293
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,300
 but I need to end this relationship.

1294
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,020
 It's the most important decision you're gonna make.

1295
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,620
 And it is far better to have a broken heart in dating

1296
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,060
 than a broken home in marriage.

1297
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,140
 And God doesn't want you to experience that.

1298
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,740
 You don't wanna experience that.

1299
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,740
 So in conclusion, when it comes to when to date,

1300
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,100
 when marriage is on the horizon,

1301
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,580
 who to date, someone who has character,

1302
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,060
 is a Christ follower, who can be a lifelong companion,

1303
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,400
 and how to date, those 10 things,

1304
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,240
 I'm not gonna repeat every single one of them.

1305
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,360
 As I said, I'll close here.

1306
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:31,040
 My son, he can't put this together.

1307
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,240
 He's four.

1308
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,320
 I could leave him for six weeks

1309
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,280
 with all the food and candy and time that he wants

1310
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,640
 and come back.

1311
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,280
 He would not be able to build that.

1312
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,480
 He doesn't have what it takes.

1313
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,900
 He needs the help of his father.

1314
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,880
 When it comes to the picture of marriage that you want,

1315
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,180
 and God wants for you, and I know you want it,

1316
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,160
 of a family and a future that's not marked by divorce

1317
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,840
 and pain and heartbreak and heartache,

1318
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,940
 but marked by a healthy relationship that's not perfect,

1319
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,660
 but it's you and her or you and him,

1320
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,020
 and you're together for the rest.

1321
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,220
 You don't have what it takes to build that,

1322
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,460
 to find that picture, but your heavenly father does.

1323
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,100
 And like a father helping his son with the Legos

1324
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,400
 and build that into it, God wants to help you.

1325
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,040
 And the way that he does that is through his word,

1326
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,640
 and you walking in that, and through living with his people.

1327
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,980
 That is the only hope you have for a marriage

1328
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,160
 that experiences everything that God wants the picture

1329
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,840
 of your marriage someday to look like.

1330
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,840
 It's the only hope I have for my marriage.

1331
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,360
 My marriage is not immune and not something like,

1332
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,800
 oh, I'm in ministry, so everything's perfect

1333
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,920
 and it always will be, and everything's great

1334
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,760
 and always easy.

1335
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,560
 No, the only way that I can have the marriage

1336
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,420
 that God wants me to have for the rest of my days

1337
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,420
 is for me to be someone who takes the help of my father.

1338
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,460
 God, I don't have what it takes.

1339
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,200
 I know what sin lives inside of me.

1340
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,960
 I know the lustful thoughts, the angry thoughts.

1341
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,980
 I know all the different dysfunctional brokenness

1342
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,540
 in my own life and selfishness, and God, I need your help.

1343
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,500
 I need your word.

1344
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,400
 I need people in my life called your people, God's people,

1345
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,600
 to encourage me and call me to be the man that I want to be.

1346
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,900
 Because if I'm gonna have the marriage

1347
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,480
 that looks like the picture, you call me to in scripture.

1348
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,760
 It's gonna take you.

1349
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,620
 It's gonna take your help.

1350
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:21,480
 And God wants you to have that.

1351
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,760
 There's no magic formula.

1352
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,480
 And you can.

1353
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,240
 If you and that person that you end up dating

1354
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,120
 or pursuing marriage together are both saying,

1355
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,840
 we are going to put the Legos in our father's hands.

1356
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,720
 We're gonna put the marriage in our father's hands.

1357
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,240
 We're gonna do what our father says,

1358
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,740
 live with our father's people.

1359
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,160
 You can.

1360
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,060
 That's the formula.

1361
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,860
 Ultimately, dating is to lead us to marriage.

1362
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,740
 You know, it's funny, and I'm gonna land here.

1363
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,240
 Biblically, marriage is supposed to lead us to something.

1364
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,900
 So dating leads to marriage, but what does marriage

1365
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,740
 lead us to?

1366
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,580
 Well, Paul, in chapter five of the book of Ephesians,

1367
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,540
 verse 31 and 32, he says this.

1368
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,620
 He says, here's what marriage leads to.

1369
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,220
 For this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother

1370
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,660
 and be united to his wife, and the two will become

1371
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,500
 one flesh.

1372
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,340
 Really pretty verse, probably heard it at a wedding.

1373
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,060
 Paul says this is a profound mystery.

1374
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,980
 For years, I read that and I was like, oh, he's talking

1375
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,860
 about two becoming one.

1376
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,260
 That is pretty crazy, Paul, two become one flesh.

1377
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,820
 But I'm talking about Christ and the church.

1378
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:36,640
 That's the mystery.

1379
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,960
 The mystery is not two becoming one in marriage.

1380
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,800
 The mystery is how marriage, just like dating leads

1381
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,020
 to marriage, marriage was meant to lead us to Jesus.

1382
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,660
 The picture of Jesus and his relationship with his bride

1383
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,940
 called the church.

1384
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,260
 And you're not gonna have the right type of marriage

1385
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,040
 relationship someday if you don't have the relationship

1386
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,020
 with the one whom marriage and life is all about.

1387
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,860
 And if you're in the room and you've never put your faith

1388
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,580
 in Jesus and what he did on the cross,

1389
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,820
 he came into this world.

1390
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:09,020
 God became a man and he died for you and he died for me.

1391
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,360
 And he died so that every person could be in an eternal

1392
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,980
 relationship with him.

1393
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,200
 And it's though as it were, that's marriage.

1394
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,100
 It's certainly, Paul would say, what marriage points us to.

1395
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,380
 It's about a far more important, far greater relationship.

1396
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,920
 And if you've never trusted in Jesus as the payment

1397
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,020
 for your sin and his death on the cross paid for your sin,

1398
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,740
 for your abortion, for your sexual sin, for your baggage

1399
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,840
 in dating relationships, for everything, every look

1400
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,800
 at pornography, every time you've abused another person,

1401
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,720
 all of it, he paid for.

1402
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,940
 That's why he came.

1403
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,800
 And then he rose from the dead.

1404
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,640
 You know what that showed?

1405
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,200
 Check cleared.

1406
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,840
 That moment when you're paying out for groceries

1407
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
 at the store and you're like waiting,

1408
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,100
 is the card gonna go through, is it not?

1409
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,960
 And then you get back and oh man, the payment,

1410
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,880
 I had more than enough in there.

1411
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,760
 That's what the grave, that's what the resurrection,

1412
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,920
 what it showed the world, more than enough.

1413
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,760
 It's covered.

1414
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,560
 I got you.

1415
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:08,040
 It's not your decision, it's not who to date.

1416
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,120
 It's who are you going to worship as your king, your Lord.

1417
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,840
 Are you gonna receive that free gift in Jesus?

1418
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,500
 That's the most important relationship decision

1419
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,200
 you'll ever make and that you need to make.

1420
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,440
 And you'll never get the other ones right

1421
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,880
 or the marriage right until you get that one right.

1422
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,400
 For the rest of us, we got some work to do

1423
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,200
 or decisions to make, some hard ones.

1424
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,720
 Should this keep moving forward?

1425
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,060
 Maybe I need to pull back.

1426
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,860
 Maybe I need to spend some time healing.

1427
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,500
 And others of us, man, it's time to move.

1428
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,020
 You're gonna get married and we gotta take the next step

1429
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,300
 because you know, here's how you know,

1430
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:49,620
 you and her both know, you know what marriage is all about.

1431
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,420
 Not you, Jesus.

1432
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,260
 Let me pray.

1433
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:58,820
 Father, thank you that

1434
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,900
 left to our own self, every relationship we have

1435
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,540
 would fall apart.

1436
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,820
 Every marriage, including my own, has no hope

1437
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,700
 of being all that you want it to be

1438
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,240
 and all that it could be without you and your help.

1439
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:24,920
 I pray that you would create amazing, godly marriages

1440
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,660
 and homes through every person listening right now.

1441
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,620
 Some of whom, they have to first be in right relationship

1442
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,780
 with you and they've never done that

1443
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,700
 and they've never had a moment.

1444
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,300
 So would tonight be their night?

1445
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,100
 I pray for couples who know they need to break up,

1446
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,660
 that you would meet them there as they walk through

1447
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,740
 just the painful decision that man,

1448
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,220
 I think this needs to end.

1449
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,500
 And I pray for wisdom and clarity and courage

1450
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,060
 for couples that need to take the next step

1451
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,300
 and move in the direction of marriage.

1452
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,380
 Thank you for sending your son the ultimate relationship

1453
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,540
 we were made for. We worship you now and so on. Amen.
