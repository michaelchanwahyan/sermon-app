00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Well, how we doing porch?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Come on, let's go.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey, we are so glad that you are here tonight at the porch.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 My name is Josiah Jones, I have the privilege of being on staff

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 here leading our 200 leaders that make up this Tuesday night

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 gathering that we call the porch.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Can we just give a round of welcome for our leaders?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Yeah, come on.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 The ones that are in the parking lot sweating, although we got a

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 cold front, praise God, right?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Those that are in the town center greeting you and those

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 that are ushering you to your seat, even in this moment.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Man, we are so grateful for the leaders that serve here at the porch.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Well, hey, we want to welcome you.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 You could be anywhere on a Tuesday night, especially if this is your

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 first time, thank you for choosing to be right here with us at the porch.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 It's a real honor and we know you could be in a lot of different places.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I want to give a shout out to our Porch Live locations, watching online,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Porch Live Boise, Idaho, Scottsdale, Arizona, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Midland,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Texas, and a whole host of others.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Can you give it up for our Porch Live locations?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Tonight is a really special night because you're going to get to hear

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 from a friend of ours at the porch.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 His name is Luke Lefevre.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And Luke is a friend, like I just said, of the porch.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 He's with his wife Rebecca tonight.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And here's what you need to know about Luke and Rebecca.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Luke is 26 years old, lives in Nashville, Tennessee.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Anybody from Nashville in the room tonight?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Okay, a few of us.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And they have a daughter, Evelyn, who is 1 1/2.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And, man, they are here tonight because I believe that Luke has a call on

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 his life for this generation.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 He leads a young adult movement called Consecrate.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And God is using his voice all across the nation, I would even go as far

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 as to say all across the world, to call this generation to radical

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 holiness, to deep devotion to Jesus and his call and audacious faith.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And I believe he has a message tonight for us here on a Tuesday in

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 September that's going to call us to take next steps in our faith.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So before Luke comes up and gives the message, I want to pray.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And here's what I'm going to ask you.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm going to invite you to pray with me.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And I'm going to ask you first to pray for yourself as you ask the Lord

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 wherever you are in your faith or if this is your first time or your 50th

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 time that you just say, God, I'm available for the next 30 minutes.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I just want to hear from you.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And so would you take the next 30 seconds just to pray and say, Lord,

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I'm available and I want to hear from you.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And help me to not have any distractions so I can be laser focused on what

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 your word has to say tonight.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Take 30 seconds and pray for that.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Then I'm going to ask that you would pray for Luke as he gets ready to come

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 up here, opens up God's word, that you would just ask the Lord to give

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 him his words, that any word that comes out of Luke's mouth would be words

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 from God.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And that he would give him boldness and courage to proclaim what he has laid

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 on Luke's heart.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 God in heaven, thank you for this night, a Tuesday in September 2023,

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 that you have destined us to be at tonight.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 There is no chance that just people are here randomly.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 God, but you have divinely put them in this seat in Dallas, Texas,

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and all across the nation to hear a message from Luke Lefevre.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And I pray, God, that you would use him mightily,

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 that his words would be your words.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And God, that you would remove any distraction in this place.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And that we would grab on to everything that you would want us to grab on to

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 tonight.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And we would walk out of these doors ready and available for any call that

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 you would have on our life.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And God, you would use him in a way where you get much,

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 much glory as a result of him being here.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And God, we would leave with a higher view of you and a lower view of

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 ourselves and it would cause an incredible response in our life.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Y'all give it up for Luke Lefevre.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Man, honored to be with you guys tonight.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Like Josiah said, my name is Luke.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I feel like we're just in a room of a few thousand of our closest friends.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So you can consider me a friend.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Because I want to talk to us just as a generation tonight.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Because I believe that God -- man, guys,

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 do not let anybody tell you that God is not moving in our generation.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 God is moving in incredible ways across the earth right now.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And I wish I could just take you in.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I don't have time tonight.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 But I wish I could take you in to just conversations, phone calls,

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 meetings that I've had in the past two weeks alone.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I am convinced that I think the next ten years are going to be ten of the

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 greatest years of global revival that the world has ever seen.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 God is moving in that type of way.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 In our generation.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I think what God did at Asbury and things he's been doing across the

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 nation, I think that was just like the cloud the size of a man's hand.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But I hear the sound, like Elijah prayed,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I hear the sound of a heavy rain coming on our generation.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 On our nation.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And God wants to use us to do -- I mean,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 think about the miracle that is in this room right now.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I mean there's a few thousand of us in this room.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So many of you watching online.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And I know you're watching at the porch live locations.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 That there's this many young adults gathered together on a Tuesday night

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 in the United States hungry for God.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 That you came here because you're hungry for God.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Like that doesn't just happen.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 That's a miracle of the grace of God.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Like God is moving in our generation.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And I grew up with a grandfather who was a pastor.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And so I used to -- he used to live around the corner from me and I would

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 hop on my bike and ride over to my grandfather's house and he would tell

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 me stories about revival.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 He would tell me stories about moves of God throughout history.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And one of his favorite stories to tell is this move of God that took

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 place off the coast of Scotland on a small group of islands called the

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Hebrides.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And on the Hebrides islands the church was dying.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 There were no young people in the churches.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 The church was dying out.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 It was basically at risk of completely disappearing.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And there were these two elderly ladies that got together.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 They were in their 70s, 80s.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And they began to cry out to God for revival on their islands.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And they cried out to God and cried out to God and cried out to God and

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 enlisting others to cry out to God for revival.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And suddenly something broke open over the islands.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And they said it was like people became -- the words they used was

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 God-conscious.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It was like heaven opened over the islands.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And there were people plowing in the fields and falling to their knees and

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 giving their lives to Christ.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And the pastor tells the stories of 300 young people at a party and the

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 presence of God hits the party.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 They run from the party to a church where services have been going until

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 11 o'clock at night.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And the pastor comes out, sees 300 young people standing outside and

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 going, hey, we don't even know why we're here.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Something drew us to this place.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Can you talk to us?

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And he shares the gospel.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 They all get saved.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Story after story after story like that.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And the man who led that revival, his name was Duncan Campbell.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He said God sets to empowering a people, he first sets to purifying a

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 people.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And he used to say this, he said the crying need of our day, this was in

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 the 1950s.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He said the crying need of our day is a baptism of holiness.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Of holy living.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And he said when that move of God was beginning to come to a close, he

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 began to understand that holiness and revival would always be

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 interconnected.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And so tonight I think there's something, if we want to see a move of

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 God in our generation, if we want to see, like, we're hungry for God to

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 move.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 There's something in our generation that's just not common.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 There's a sovereign thing that God is doing in our generation of a hunger

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 for God, of a move for God.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 But if we want to see revival, we have to lay hold of a hunger for

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 holiness.

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Holiness isn't about being better than the person next to us or trying

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 to do a bunch of good things.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 It's about a hunger for God himself.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 It's about a hunger for God.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 The Bible says in Hebrews pursue holiness without which no man will

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 see God.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It is a hunger to run after holiness because we want to see God.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 And guys, tonight as I was praying into tonight, there were so many

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 things that I wanted to talk about.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Like, man, can I take him into some of the things that are happening

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 around the world right now.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And I want to talk about what God has done in our generation to stir

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 faith for what he wants to do.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And as I prayed for you all, I was just praying for you these past

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 weeks.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And I kept hearing the verse in Matthew 24 that says as it was in the

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 days of Noah, so will it be when the son of man comes.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be when the son of man

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 comes.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And that's in Matthew 24.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 And as we get into this, I want to give us a working definition of

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 holiness.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Because I think there's a lot of confusion around what that is.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And I would say a pursuit of holiness is this.

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 It is actively ridding from our lives anything that might hinder

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 intimacy with Jesus.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And I want to give you a definition of holiness.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 It is actively removing, cutting loose from our lives anything that

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 might hinder intimacy with God.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 So if you're in Matthew 24, verse 37, we're going to start there.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And it says this, but it says...

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the son of

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 man, Jesus, be when he returns.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It says...

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking,

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 So also will the coming of the son of man be.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Then two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 left.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Two women will be grinding at the mill, one will be taken and the

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 other left.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 house to be broken into.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 So also be ready, for the son of man is coming at an hour you do

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 not expect.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 So we need to ask the question, what was happening in the days of

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Noah?

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What was this overarching characteristic as it was in the days

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 of Noah, so will it be at the return of Christ?

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 What was happening in the days of Noah?

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 And I think the overarching characteristic, we know that story,

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 right?

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I have a 1.5-year-old daughter, she has this little book about Noah

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 and the story, right?

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But what was this overarching characteristic of that generation?

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I would say it was widespread complacency towards the wrath of

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 God against sin.

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 There was a flood coming.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And no one took it seriously.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 No one cared.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 No one paid attention.

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 There is one guy building an ark and going, listen, I'm going to

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 pursue righteousness and holiness and an entire generation is going,

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 God doesn't really care about the way I'm living my life.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And as I prayed for us tonight, I felt like there was a warning for

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 us as a generation that we need to lay hold of.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 That I think there is a couple people that I'm talking to in the

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 room tonight.

232
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And I think first, there is maybe a few of you in the room, hopefully

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 there is a lot of you in the room, maybe you got invited here and

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 you don't know Christ or maybe you think you know Jesus but you

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 don't know the way to Jesus.

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Maybe you randomly found your way in here and maybe a friend

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 invited you after lunch and you are here tonight and you have a

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 date with the destiny of God for your life tonight.

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 That he brought you into this room because he has eternal plans

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 and purposes for you.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That he loves you and he wanted you to be here tonight to hear

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 about the only thing that can change your life and that's Jesus

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Christ.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Come on, somebody believes that.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I don't know if anyone does.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And I think there is another group of us in the room.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Maybe you surrendered your life to Christ, you have given your

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 life to Christ, you have been following Jesus but there are

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 areas of compromise and unconfessed sin in your life

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 you have been unwilling to give up.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And Jesus is calling you to repentance and to turning

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 tonight.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And so what are the things in this passage, what do we need to

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 know?

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And I think the first thing is this, as it was in the days of

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Noah, so will it be when the son of man comes.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I think the first thing is this, we cannot mistake God's patience

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 with us as his passivity towards our sin.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 God is so patient with us.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 He is so kind.

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 He is so loving.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 He is so merciful.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 But I think there is a danger for us as a generation when we see

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 the patience and the love and the kindness of God to assume that

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 that also equals his passivity towards our sin.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 God's patience is not his passivity.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Sin isn't cute.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 It's not a guilty pleasure.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It's what crucified the son of God.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Stop playing with it.

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Listen, we have become playful and made pets out of the things

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 that crucified the man we claim to love.

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Something doesn't add up there.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 We get entertained by and consume the things.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 We watch the shows and listen to the music and say the things that

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 put the son of God on the cross and we claim to love and follow

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 and we champion it and cheer for it.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Something doesn't add up there.

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And God is calling us to change.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Listen, it says until the day Noah entered the ark, they thought

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 God had forgotten.

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And I think that's the case of some of us in the room.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 We're thinking either God doesn't see what I'm doing.

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 God doesn't care what I'm doing.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Or at least he doesn't care enough for me to do anything about it.

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 He doesn't care enough for me to change.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 But let me say this, God does not take lightly in the lives of his

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 people that which killed his son.

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I have a guy that I have been discipling for the past couple of

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 years and we were having a conversation the other day.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And he's getting his degree in philosophy and he was in his

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 philosophy class the other day.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And his professor goes, hey, I want to challenge you guys.

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Take your religion, whatever religion you believe.

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Whatever that God says is a sin, go do it.

296
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I dare you.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Go do it.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 See if there is any wrath.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 See if there is any judgment.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 There won't be.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And then do it again and see if anything happens.

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He goes, then you will come to know that everything you believe

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 is a lie.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 There was this famous message that was preached in the early

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 1700s by a man named Jonathan Edwards and it was attributed to

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 being one of the things that sparked one of the greatest

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 revivals in American history.

308
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And I laugh because this message is getting a lot of bad rap

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 online.

310
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 People keep posting about it.

311
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And anybody who is giving it a bad rap probably hasn't actually

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 read it.

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 But when he preached this message, so many people started

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 getting saved.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And it was this message that was called "Sinners in the Hands of

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 an Angry God."

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And has a very deceiving title.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Because it makes it feel like, oh, God is this angry person that

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 can't wait to get his hands on sinners and crush them.

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 That's not what he's talking about.

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Because what he's talking about is this.

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 He goes, the Bible says that the wages of sin is death.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And it also says that all have sinned.

324
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And there are so many people going around, one day I will

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 stand before God and he'll pronounce me guilty or not

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 guilty for sin.

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That's not how it works.

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 He goes, the pronouncement of guilty has already gone out over

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 every man and woman who has ever lived.

330
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And God has no obligation to keep us from separation from him.

331
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And you know what the only thing is that is keeping us at any

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 moment from separation from God for eternity?

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 The patience of a gracious God giving us time to repent and

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 turn.

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 His patience in holding us.

336
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 In going, this thing is after your destruction.

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 This thing you're entertaining in your life that is coming after

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 you.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 He's going, I'm giving you time.

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 But it is not -- his patience is not his passivity.

341
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 We serve a kind, gracious, merciful, unthinkably loving

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 God.

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Let me say this quickly.

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 You may have had -- so much of our view of God is determined by

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 the dad that we had.

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And some of you may have had an abusive, controlling father.

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And that is not who God is.

348
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 But let me say this, he's also not the passive father who lets

349
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 his kids do whatever they want even though it's destroying

350
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 them.

351
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Like I have a 1.5-year-old daughter and the hardest thing

352
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 for me to do is to discipline her.

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Because I'm like, man, I want you to love me.

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I want you to like me.

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I don't want you not to like me.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I want to give you good things.

357
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I want to be kind to you.

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But as a dad, loving her is helping her see the things in

359
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 her life that are destroying her.

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 That's the kind of father that God is.

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 We serve a loving God.

362
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But I think we can also easily forget that we serve the Jesus

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 who the book of Revelation says his eyes are like flames of

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 fire.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That a two-edged sword comes out of his mouth.

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 That the prophet Isaiah when he saw God, the angels cried out,

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 holy, holy, holy.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 We took my daughter to the zoo like last week.

369
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And I was super excited to actually take her.

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I know it sounds -- I was more excited about the zoo than she

371
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 was.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 But I was super excited because there was this new tiger exhibit

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 they built at our zoo.

374
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It won a ton of awards.

375
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Pretty cool.

376
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 We go and I'm super excited.

377
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Please let the tiger be there where we can see it.

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 We pull up and got our daughter in the stroller.

379
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The tiger is sitting two feet from the glass.

380
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 It's right there.

381
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 My daughter wants to get out and see it.

382
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 We take her out and she's up on the glass, two feet from this

383
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 tiger.

384
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I was super excited to get there and see it.

385
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 But when I saw the tiger, I felt sad.

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I was like -- this isn't how this relationship was supposed to

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 be.

388
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Because the zookeeper is telling us, this thing is 250 pounds of

389
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 pure muscle.

390
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 500 pounds per square inch bite.

391
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 They feed it bone because it crushes bone with its teeth and

392
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 can literally just swallow bone whole.

393
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I'm sitting there and going, this isn't how this relationship

394
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 was supposed to be.

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 This thing cooped up in an enclosure for people's

396
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 entertainment.

397
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Like he's wild.

398
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 He's dangerous.

399
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And that's beautiful.

400
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And part of me looked at that tiger and thought, I want to

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 have reverence for you.

402
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Like I want to have a reverence for you.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 That's how this relationship is supposed to work.

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I shouldn't have my 1.5-year-old daughter playing around a tiger.

405
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Like I should have come up on you in the wild.

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Where there's no glass enclosure for my entertainment.

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I'm coming up on you in your territory and I'm terrified and

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 in awe of the side of you.

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And I give you honor and respect.

410
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And there is -- that's what this relationship is supposed to be

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 like.

412
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Listen, our God is described in scripture as a lion.

413
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And many of us are trying to put him in our cute little

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 enclosure so that he's nice to look at but no longer wild.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 No longer dangerous.

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 No longer has wrath towards sin.

417
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I think there's this danger for us in our generations.

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Like we want to make Jesus into like this nice, like Middle

419
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Eastern Mr. Rogers.

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like that's what we're trying to do.

421
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Look, I love Mr. Rogers.

422
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 I think there's a ton of amazing Jesus-like qualities in Mr.

423
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Rogers.

424
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 But he's also the lion of the tribe of Judah.

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And it's time we start treating and remembering him as such.

426
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There's this temptation for us to shave the mane off the lion of

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Judah and take his teeth out and put him in an enclosure we come

428
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 to for entertainment.

429
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Or when we want something.

430
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Listen, you can't tame God.

431
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 He will not be a mess.

432
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He will not be put in our cute little enclosure for our

433
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 entertainment.

434
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 He is sovereign.

435
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 He is holy.

436
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 He is the I am who I am.

437
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And nobody approaches a lion in the wild casually.

438
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 We have lost our reverence for God as a generation.

439
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 We need our reverence back.

440
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 We need our holiness back.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 We need our fear of God back.

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 In the words of R.C. Sproul, a God who is only love.

443
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Only grace.

444
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Only mercy.

445
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 No sovereignty.

446
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 No justice.

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 No holiness.

448
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 No wrath.

449
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Is an idol.

450
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 It is something we've made in our own image to try to make God

451
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 like us.

452
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I think one of my favorite descriptions of Christ actually

453
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 comes from C.S. Lewis' book, "The Lion, the Witch, and the

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Wardrobe."

455
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And that story, there's four children and they're going to meet

456
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 this lion named Aslan who is a depiction of Christ.

457
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And they're going to meet him for the first time.

458
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And one of the oldest children named Susan, she finds out for

459
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 the first time that he's not a man, he's actually a lion.

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And she goes, wait, wait, wait.

461
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 She goes, he's a lion?

462
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 I thought he was a man.

463
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And she goes, is he safe?

464
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And their guide who is getting ready to take them to see Aslan

465
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 looks at her and goes, he's a lion.

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Of course he's not safe.

467
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 But he's good.

468
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 That's our God.

469
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 He is good.

470
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 He is loving.

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 He is merciful.

472
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 But he is not this Middle Eastern Mr. Rogers that we've tried to

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 make him into.

474
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 He is bold and powerful as a lion.

475
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 We cannot mistake God's patience with us as his passivity towards

476
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 our sin.

477
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 But there's something I think we need to grasp here.

478
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Because I think we can get this twisted in our minds.

479
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And the second thing we need to know is that Jesus at the end of

480
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 the day, he's not as preoccupied and focused on your sin as he is

481
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 on your sanctification.

482
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 We think Jesus, like we get this idea that Jesus, that the father,

483
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 that they're just sitting up in heaven nitpicking at our sins.

484
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 He's not.

485
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 He's passionate about your holiness.

486
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 He's not sitting up there going, man, one, two, there's another one.

487
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 He's going, I'm passionate about you being everything that I've

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 created you to be.

489
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 About you living the fullness of life.

490
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I'll get into this later.

491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 But in John 16, Jesus has been telling his disciples to keep his

492
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 commandments.

493
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 And then he gets into John 17 and says, listen, I have told you

494
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 these things so that my joy may be in you.

495
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And your joy may be full.

496
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 See, holiness is not this straight jacket that leads to dead,

497
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 lifeless religion.

498
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 It is actually one of the greatest keys to life-giving joy in Jesus.

499
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Jesus is not as focused on your sin as he is on your sanctification.

500
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 The only reason Jesus points out our sin and is calling us out of our

501
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 sin is because he's trying to take us into a place of sanctification.

502
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Now, what is sanctification?

503
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Sanctification is growing in holiness and in Christ-likeness.

504
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 It's learning to love what he loves, to hate what he hates, and to

505
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 live how he lived.

506
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 I once heard this story, whether it's true or not, it's up for debate,

507
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 but I think the principle is powerful.

508
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 There was a man who claimed that one night he was asleep in bed and he

509
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 opened his eyes to an angel being right in front of his face.

510
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And he opened his eyes and said there's this angel literally right in

511
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 his face.

512
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And he looked in the eyes of the angel and he goes, what are you

513
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 looking for?

514
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And the angel looks into his eyes and he said, God is looking to see

515
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 how much of his son he sees in you.

516
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The father isn't sitting up in heaven counting your sins going one,

517
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 two, three, four.

518
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 He's going, how much of my son do I see in you?

519
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Man, and I want the answer when God looks at me, when God looks at us

520
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 to be a whole lot.

521
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Like I want God to be like I see so much of my son in you.

522
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Perfect?

523
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 No.

524
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Improving?

525
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Yes.

526
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I want God to look at my life and go I see so much of my son in you.

527
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 That the image of Jesus in me isn't marred and muddied and confused by

528
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 sin and compromise in my life.

529
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I heard this song last week and I just haven't been able to get it out

530
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 of my head.

531
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It's a song called I'm Not My Own by Skye Peterson.

532
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And she says in the verse, she says my body is a temple of the living

533
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 God.

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I will worship in this house that his blood has bought.

535
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 As I bear his image, I love this, may I not profane the holiness I hold

536
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 in this earthly frame.

537
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And then she goes on in the course to say I belong to the Lord.

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I am not my own.

539
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 At the end of the day, Jesus is not as interested in your sin as he is

540
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 in your sanctification.

541
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Why?

542
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Because nothing destroys intimacy with God and effectiveness for the

543
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 kingdom of God faster than unconfessed, unrepentant sin.

544
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Listen, Jesus desires your holiness because he desires your joy.

545
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Jesus desires your holiness because he desires your joy.

546
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He is after our intimacy, our joy, and our effectiveness for the mission

547
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 and the kingdom of God.

548
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 If you would turn quickly to 2 Timothy 2, verses 19-21.

549
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I will go through this quickly.

550
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 It says this, it says...

551
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but

552
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 also of wood and clay.

553
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Some for honor and some for dishonor.

554
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 What is he saying there?

555
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Like when you go to like your grandma's house, I don't know if your

556
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 grandma is like mine but she had this fine china that was used for

557
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 special occasions.

558
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 He's going there are things in a house that are used for special

559
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 purposes.

560
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And he says...

561
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 What is Paul saying in this passage to Timothy?

562
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 He's saying, listen, God wants to use all of us.

563
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But have you ever wondered why does God use certain people to send

564
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 revival to nations?

565
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Why does God use some people to turn cities and history upside down

566
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 and not use us?

567
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Is it just a random sovereignty of God?

568
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Paul says here it's not.

569
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 He says he uses those who have consecrated, who have set their lives

570
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 apart to God.

571
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Does God use perfect people?

572
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 No.

573
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Because none of those exist except for Jesus.

574
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 But purified people, yes.

575
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 I think John Tyson when he was commentating on this passage said it

576
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 best.

577
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He said, listen, if you're not living a consecrated life, God won't

578
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 love you any less.

579
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 But he will use you less.

580
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 The power of God flows unhindered through a holy life.

581
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 In the words of Ian Bounds who wrote a book called "Power Through

582
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Prayer."

583
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 He wrote in the 1800s, he led a move of God not far from where I

584
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 live.

585
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 One of the incredible moves of God of the past several hundred years.

586
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And he wrote this in his book "Power Through Prayer" in the 1800s.

587
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 He said, God doesn't need great talents nor great learning nor

588
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 great preachers that God needs.

589
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Like what's -- not claiming I'm a great preacher.

590
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I'm saying God doesn't need just more preachers.

591
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 He doesn't need more people to talk into a microphone.

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 He says what God is looking for are people great in holiness, great in

593
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 faith, great in love, great in fidelity, great for God.

594
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 People always preaching by holy sermons in the pulpit and by holy

595
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 words.

596
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 He said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness, great in

597
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 faith, great in love, great in fidelity, great in faith, great in

598
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 love, great in faith.

599
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

600
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 great in faith, great in love, great in faith.

601
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

602
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 great in faith.

603
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

604
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 great in faith.

605
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

606
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 great in faith.

607
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

608
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 great in faith.

609
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

610
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 great in faith.

611
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

612
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 great in faith.

613
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

614
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 great in faith.

615
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

616
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 great in faith.

617
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

618
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 great in faith.

619
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 great in faith.

621
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

622
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 great in faith.

623
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

624
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 great in faith.

625
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,

626
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 great in faith.

627
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And on either side of this road you have two ditches from the pit of

628
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 hell that are called legalism and lawlessness.

629
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Now what are both of those?

630
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Legalism says I can be as good as God.

631
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Lawlessness says I know better than God.

632
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 So legalism, perfect example in the scripture is the Pharisees.

633
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 They're going, I don't need Jesus.

634
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I can earn my way to God by keeping laws.

635
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And everyone has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

636
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 There is nothing you can do.

637
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Growing up and this is something in my own life that I battle with

638
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 and I go, Lord, rid this from my heart.

639
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 My temptation is to think God had to save me just not from that much.

640
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 God had to save me just not from that much.

641
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And it is like we have fallen so far.

642
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Like we think we're not that bad because we live among a bunch of

643
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 other really bad people.

644
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And I think I'm not that bad of a basketball player because I play

645
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 with a bunch of mediocre people.

646
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And if I play LeBron one-on-one, I'm a horrible basketball player.

647
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 When we compare ourselves with the glory of God we realize how far

648
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 from him we are.

649
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And legalism says I can be as good as God.

650
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 But I think our temptation more so in our generation is to fall into

651
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 the ditch of lawlessness that says I know better than God.

652
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 I know better than you that this thing isn't good for my life or

653
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 displeases you or I shouldn't be walking in this.

654
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 But I know better than you because I'm getting fulfillment and joy

655
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 out of it and I think it's going to be all right.

656
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 I'm going to keep walking in this because I like it and I think I

657
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 know better than you do.

658
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But God is looking at the long game and this is out for your

659
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 destruction.

660
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And it's the twin ditches of legalism and lawlessness.

661
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And in Matthew 24 earlier in that chapter in verse 12 it says this,

662
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 and because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow

663
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 cold.

664
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Love for Jesus grows cold in an atmosphere of lawlessness.

665
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 We cannot say that we love God and yet have no desire to obey God.

666
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Those things are incongruent with the scriptures.

667
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 We cannot say we love God and have no desire to obey God.

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 What is lawlessness?

669
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 It's contempt for or violation of or disregard for the commands of

670
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 God.

671
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 And lawlessness in the end, you might be able to entertain a

672
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 little bit of it now.

673
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Like you may be able to have a little bit of fire and a little

674
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 bit of lawlessness in your life but in the end that thing is going

675
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 to kill.

676
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 It will smother the flame of fire and passion for Jesus in your

677
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 life.

678
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 It will take it out.

679
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And lawlessness is a fake liberty.

680
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 It is counterfeit freedom.

681
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 See, liberty and freedom in Jesus, this loving obedience to

682
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Jesus, liberty in Jesus is not the freedom to sin however we

683
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 want, do whatever we want and still be covered by the grace of

684
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 God.

685
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Liberty is the freedom to choose to obey God.

686
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Not simply out of obligation but because we love him.

687
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 It's liberty because it's no longer forced but rather out of

688
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 freedom.

689
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 In John 14, 15, Jesus is speaking to his disciples, if you love

690
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 me, you will keep my commandments.

691
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 The evidence of love for God is a desire to keep his commands.

692
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 He says again in John 14, 21, he who has my commands and keeps

693
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 them, it's he who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by

694
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 my father and I will love him and manifest myself to him.

695
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 I will reveal myself to him.

696
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 He says in 15.10, if you keep my commandments, you will abide

697
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 and live in my love.

698
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Guys, I think if some of the people in our generation, like

699
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 if some of us were around at the time Jesus was preaching that

700
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 message in John 14 and 15, I think some of us would be going

701
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 up to him after service and hey, Jesus, can I talk to you for a

702
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 second.

703
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Great message.

704
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 It was good.

705
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 It was pretty good.

706
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 But I don't know if you know this.

707
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I do.

708
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 That's why I am telling you.

709
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Is all of that like obedience to command stuff, it's kind of

710
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 legalistic.

711
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Like I don't know if you know that.

712
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 But it's kind of leaning towards legalism.

713
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 But he's going no, no, no.

714
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 He goes, I have told you these things so that my joy may be in

715
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 you and your joy may be fullest.

716
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And I think our generation if we were back in the days of King

717
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Josiah and the Old Testament, maybe some of us would have said

718
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 the same thing.

719
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Where Josiah becomes king at 8 years old.

720
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 His dad is an idiot and leads the entire nation of Israel into

721
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 sin and corruption and is tearing the nation apart.

722
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Josiah becomes king at 8 years old.

723
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And when he's a teenager, they uncover the word of God that his

724
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 dad had buried under a bunch of junk in the temple for decades.

725
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Like it had disappeared.

726
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And he gets a hold of it.

727
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 He reads it like in one sitting.

728
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Reads the Old Testament essentially.

729
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Not all of it because not all had been written by the point he

730
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 was alive.

731
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 But he reads the scriptures for the first time and sees how far

732
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 they are from how God called them to live.

733
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 And he starts going from north to south in the kingdom of

734
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Israel and tearing down every single idol in all of Israel.

735
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And some of you are going, Josiah, calm down bro.

736
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Every idol.

737
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Every one.

738
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Listen, okay, you can have the big ones.

739
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 Take the big ones.

740
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Those are great.

741
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Like take those.

742
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 But let us keep our household gods.

743
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Let's just keep the little ones.

744
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Okay, not the household gods.

745
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Let us at least keep the high places.

746
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 And the high places in Israel weren't even necessarily places

747
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 of worship to false gods.

748
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 They were attempts to worship God how people wanted to worship

749
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 God.

750
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 They were altars to Yahweh built in a way that was not prescribed

751
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 by the word of God.

752
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 That they are going, I'm going to worship God and do it how I

753
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 want.

754
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 And no king in Israel's history had ever torn them down.

755
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 They had torn down the other idols and taken the household

756
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 idols down.

757
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 But they had never taken the high places down.

758
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 And Josiah goes, no.

759
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 No compromise.

760
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Not in my day.

761
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 And listen, I think there are some of us, I think we are in

762
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 danger of a generation of not even realizing how far we are

763
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 from God because we haven't been in the book enough to know.

764
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Like Josiah uncovers the word of God that's been hidden for

765
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 generations and he weeps and he's like, where was this?

766
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 Nobody told me this.

767
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Nobody told me that God wanted to bless our nation.

768
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 That he wanted to live among his people.

769
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 That he wanted to dwell in our midst.

770
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 That the manifest presence of God could be in our nation and

771
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 in our lives.

772
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 And we could be a beacon of hope to the world.

773
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And this is what he tells us to live.

774
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 And we have completely squandered it and we have

775
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 completely neglected God.

776
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 And look, if we will get into the word of God, it will expose

777
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 the idols in our lives.

778
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 I think God is looking for a generation that is going no

779
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 compromise.

780
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 We want God.

781
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Listen, sacrificial obedience isn't legalism.

782
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 It is evidence that there's nothing in your life that you

783
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 love as much as nearness to God.

784
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 You know, one of the other things that we learned when we

785
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 were at that tiger exhibit, obviously you can tell I really

786
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 liked the tiger exhibit.

787
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 My wife actually pointed this out so I'm going to pretend like

788
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 I came up with this.

789
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 One of the other things we learned at the tiger exhibit,

790
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 they have three tigers at this one exhibit.

791
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 But they will only put one in the enclosure at a time.

792
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And so some people were asking the zookeeper who was standing

793
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 there explaining, why do you only put one at a time?

794
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Will they fight?

795
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 He goes, no, no, they won't fight.

796
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 And at that point he starts to explain to us the territorial

797
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 nature of big cats.

798
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Like tigers and lions.

799
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 He goes, they won't fight.

800
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 He goes, you would just never see them.

801
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 He goes, because one would go to one corner of the enclosure and

802
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 one would go to the other corner of the enclosure.

803
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Why?

804
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Because big cats don't share territory.

805
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 The lion of Judah is not content to share the territory of our

806
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 hearts with idols and unrepentant sin.

807
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 He won't do it.

808
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 He'll go, you want to live that way?

809
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 It will smother your love and our intimacy.

810
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 He's not going to share the territory of our hearts with

811
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 idols.

812
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Sacrificial obedience is not legalism.

813
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 It is evidence of true love for Jesus.

814
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 And I want to say this lastly.

815
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 We're talking about in the days of Noah, as it was in the days of

816
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Noah, so will it be when the son of man comes.

817
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 I was meditating on that passage as I was preparing for tonight

818
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 and just thinking about that, I'm going, really, Lord, like one

819
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 righteous man?

820
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 One righteous man and his family were saved out of all of those

821
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 people, really God?

822
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 And I just felt him just remind me.

823
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Yes, Luke, only one blameless man, as it said of Noah.

824
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 But Noah was a picture of the only one righteous, sinless man

825
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 who would come to save the world of sin.

826
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 And now his family.

827
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 See, Jesus is the ark that we run into in the flood of the

828
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 wrath of God.

829
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 And we say, Jesus, save us.

830
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 It is a prophetic picture of going there is displeasure of

831
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 God against sin.

832
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 And we run in and go, Jesus, only you can cleanse me.

833
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Only you can change me.

834
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 I love what Charles Spurgeon said, you want to live a holy

835
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 life, live near to Jesus.

836
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Like we can't live in holiness in our own strength.

837
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 It is nearness to Jesus, the Holy Spirit empowering us to

838
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 live how he has called us to live.

839
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 Jesus is the ark that we run into in the midst of the flood.

840
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Listen, God's work on the cross through Jesus didn't simply

841
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 erase the wrath of God against sin.

842
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 I think we can think that, Jesus came and now poof, God no

843
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 more.

844
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 That's not what happened.

845
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 What Jesus did on the cross didn't erase God's wrath against

846
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 sin more than Noah building an ark erased the flood from

847
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 coming.

848
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 What Jesus did on the cross rescued us from God's wrath

849
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 against sin.

850
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 But I think there's this danger for us.

851
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 That I see in our generation, we don't see Noah when the flood

852
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 comes and ark is built and lifted up on the flood water and

853
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 getting on the deck and wonder how close I can get to the

854
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 railing without falling into the flood.

855
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 I wonder how close I can get.

856
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 And the rain starts to stop a little bit and flood water

857
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 coming from the springs of the deep as the word says was

858
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 happening.

859
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 And the water starts to calm a little bit.

860
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 I will take a quick dip in the flood.

861
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 I will take a swim in the water.

862
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 How close to the line can I get without falling into God's

863
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 displeasure?

864
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 And I think God is looking for a generation that's not going

865
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 how close to the line can I get without sinning.

866
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 He's looking for a generation that's asking how close to God

867
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 can I get without holding anything back from him.

868
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Jesus isn't looking for a generation that's asking how

869
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 close to God can I get without sinning.

870
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 He's looking for a generation that's going this is a gray

871
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 area so I will dive into it.

872
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 We're not looking at gray areas and going it's gray so the

873
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Bible isn't clear so I will run for it.

874
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 I will jump into it.

875
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 We're not asking is it sin.

876
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 We're asking does this thing actively draw me to Jesus?

877
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Does this actively draw me closer to God?

878
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Does this look like the pursuit of righteousness?

879
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 The pursuit of holiness?

880
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 And tonight I think there's a couple responses for us.

881
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And if you want to go ahead and stand to your feet.

882
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 I think there's a couple responses for us tonight.

883
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 And like I said at the beginning, I think there's some

884
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 people that are asking what is it that you do in here?

885
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 That you don't know Jesus.

886
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 Maybe you grew up in church.

887
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Maybe you thought you knew what it meant to follow Jesus.

888
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 Maybe Christian was just a label you used because you grew up in

889
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 a Christian home.

890
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 But you never heard that the wages of sin is death.

891
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 That all have sinned.

892
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 That what we are rightfully owed for the choices we have made to

893
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 rebel against God is separation from God for eternity.

894
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 And it's the good news that God became a man in Jesus Christ.

895
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 That he lived the life that we couldn't live.

896
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 That we've tried to live.

897
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 But we couldn't.

898
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 That we've all sinned.

899
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 And then he died the death that we deserve for our sin in our

900
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 place.

901
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 And not only did he die the death we deserve.

902
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 But three days later he rose from the dead proving he was who he

903
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 claimed to be.

904
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 The son of God.

905
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 And now he offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness of

906
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 sins to all who will repent and believe in him.

907
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 And there are some of you here tonight who you need to make the

908
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 decision to say I'm going all in.

909
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 I see that there is the wrath of God against sin.

910
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 The flood coming.

911
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 And I will not live in indifference towards it.

912
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 I see the ark.

913
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 Listen, if you were living in the days of Noah and you could see

914
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 the raindrops falling and the ark door was still open,

915
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 wouldn't you run?

916
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Wouldn't you run to go save me?

917
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 I don't care what the stipulations are.

918
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 I don't care what the qualifications need to be.

919
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 And good news, the qualification is just this, Jesus, I have no

920
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 qualifications.

921
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 I need you.

922
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 And I surrender everything in my life to you.

923
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Wouldn't you run?

924
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 That's some of us in the room tonight.

925
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 And then there's some of us in the room tonight that I think we

926
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 need to pray as the psalmist prayed in Psalm 139.

927
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 God, search me and know me.

928
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 And see if there's any wicked way or unpleasing way in me to

929
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 you.

930
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 And lead me in the way everlasting.

931
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 God, is there anything that is hindering closeness with you?

932
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Like you've just been coming off of launch, talking about the

933
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 love of God, the desire that he has to be near to his people to

934
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 live with you, to love you, to transform you.

935
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 And the pursuit of holiness isn't about going, well, I got to

936
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 clean myself up to come to God.

937
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 It's going, God, help me.

938
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 I need you.

939
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Lord, I want to live close to you.

940
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Would you shine a spotlight on any area that's compromising that

941
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 in my life.

942
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 Like listen, even recently I've been praying, Lord, is there

943
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 anything in my life.

944
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 And I felt like he was highlighting a TV show that we

945
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 watched and it was like super clean.

946
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 Except for a few pieces of this one part of it.

947
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 I felt like, Lord, listen, like nothing in your life that could

948
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 compromise intimacy with me.

949
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 How many of y'all have heard the verse draw near to God and God

950
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 will draw near to you?

951
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 Have you heard that before?

952
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Did you know that that verse is actually in the context of

953
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 repentance?

954
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 We think, draw near to God in worship.

955
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 Draw near to God in the word.

956
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Draw near to God in prayer.

957
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 But actually it says in James chapter 4, it says, cleanse your

958
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 hands, clean your hands.

959
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Purify your hearts, you double-minded.

960
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 Weep and mourn.

961
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Draw near to God and God will draw near to you.

962
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 You want to know what the key to drawing near to God is?

963
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 It's repentance.

964
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 It's going, God, I turn from anything that hinders intimacy

965
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 with you according to your word.

966
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 And I am running into full surrender to you.

967
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 And so we're going to take a moment to respond to that in

968
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 just a second.

969
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 One thing I wanted to do tonight is I know we've been talking

970
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 about holiness and there's so many practical pieces, so much

971
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 misconception around holiness in our generation.

972
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 So I recently wrote a book on this, it's actually super short.

973
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 It's like 70 pages.

974
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 I made it short on purpose.

975
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 JP, Jonathan McCloud, wrote the main endorsement for it.

976
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 But I wanted to give it to y'all.

977
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 You guys can download it for free.

978
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 Actually if you scan this QR code, you can download it for

979
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 free.

980
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 I just encourage you to read that.

981
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 Here are the keys that God is calling us to walk into.

982
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 And the subtitle of this book is rediscovering the joy of

983
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 holiness.

984
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 That God desires our holiness because he desires our joy.

985
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 So if you're looking for some practical next steps, that's a

986
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 great place to start.

987
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 I want to go ahead with every head bowed, every eye closed.

988
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 If you are here tonight and you feel the Holy Spirit drawing you

989
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 to Jesus, you're going, man, I didn't know that my sin had

990
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 separated me from God.

991
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 I thought Jesus was just like this guru guy, this nice guy to

992
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 kind of powder my life after.

993
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 I didn't know that he was saving me from the righteous judgment

994
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 of God against sin.

995
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 And you're going, tonight is my night.

996
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 I am surrendering everything to Jesus.

997
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 I'm putting my faith in Jesus.

998
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 I am turning from the way I've been walking.

999
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 I'm giving everything to Jesus.

1000
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 Just on the count of three, I want you to raise your hand and

1001
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 look up at me.

1002
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 If that's you and you feel your heart beating out of your chest,

1003
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 I want you to look up at the Holy Spirit saying, that's you.

1004
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 One, two, three.

1005
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Come on, praise God.

1006
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 Praise God, come on.

1007
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Praise God, praise God.

1008
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 Come on, thank you, Jesus.

1009
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

1010
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

1011
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 Come on, praise God.

1012
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 If you're at the porch live location, same thing.

1013
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 Just put up your hand, just this physical response going, I'm

1014
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 surrendering everything to Jesus.

1015
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 Praise God.

1016
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 And then with every head bowed, every eye closed, if there is --

1017
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 if there are those of us in the room, we're praying, God, search

1018
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 me, know me.

1019
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 See if there is any wicked way in me.

1020
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 Lead me in your way.

1021
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 If there's anything unpleasing to you, shine a spotlight in my

1022
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 heart, Holy Spirit, because I want to be near to you.

1023
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 I want to draw near to you.

1024
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 I'm not going to call for response, but what I'm going to

1025
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
 do is we go back into worship.

1026
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 If that's you, there's going to be a ministry team down here.

1027
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 If there are things you need to confess your sin, the Bible says

1028
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 to confess your sins to one another.

1029
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 Listen, I have been walking in this.

1030
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 This is the key to your freedom of confessing openly what you

1031
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 have been walking and going.

1032
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 I'm going to go to a leader, I'm going to go to one of the porch

1033
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 team members, I'm going to go, hey, this is something I have

1034
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 been struggling with, I'm walking in this, I'm confessing

1035
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 this, I'm turning from this, would you pray with me.

1036
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 I would encourage you to come down, find a team member, pray

1037
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 with them.

1038
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
 And the Bible says that if we confess our sins, he is

1039
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 faithful and he is just to forgive us our sins and to

1040
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 cleanse us.

1041
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Guys, there is nothing like the feeling of the fresh cleansing

1042
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 and washing of the Holy Spirit.

1043
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 When we come and we confess sin to God, he doesn't go, been

1044
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
 waiting for you to tell me that, should have done that a long

1045
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 time ago.

1046
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 He says, man, I have been waiting to wash you.

1047
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 All that guilt you have been feeling, all that confusion

1048
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
 you have been feeling, all that grasping for something that

1049
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 you thought was going to satisfy you but didn't, I have been

1050
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 waiting to cleanse you.

1051
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 I have been waiting to wash you clean.

1052
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 Let Jesus do that for you tonight.

1053
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 And if you gave your life to Christ for the first time, I

1054
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
 would encourage you to come down and pray with the porch

1055
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 and we will do this quickly.

1056
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 If you gave your life to Christ for the first time, we will

1057
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 pray this together.

1058
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 This prayer does not save you.

1059
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 Putting your faith in Jesus does.

1060
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
 What this prayer is, is helping to give you words to say I am

1061
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
 giving my all to Jesus.

1062
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 I encourage us to pray this together.

1063
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 Let's pray this.

1064
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 Lord Jesus, I know that I have sinned.

1065
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 That I have fallen short of your glory.

1066
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 I know that I need you.

1067
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 I know that I have been separated from you by my sin.

1068
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
 And I ask that you would come into my life.

1069
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 And change me from the inside out.

1070
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
 I give you every part of my life.

1071
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
 The big parts.

1072
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
 The small parts.

1073
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 And everything in between.

1074
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 And I commit to seek you with my whole heart.

1075
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 From this day forward.

1076
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 In Jesus' name I pray.

1077
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 Amen.

1078
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
