[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.940]   If you have a Bible, you can flip over to 1 Peter.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.760]   Hello, friends in the room,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.740]   friends in Fort Worth, Houston,
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.940]   and all over who are joining with us.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.940]   Let me read the passage that we will be in tonight
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.500]   as we continue 1 Peter,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.160]   a letter from the apostle Peter,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.200]   the leader of the disciples
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.580]   who had his life totally changed by Jesus,
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.380]   formerly known as Simon was Peter's name.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.700]   And Jesus came along and said,
[00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.060]   "I'm gonna change your name to Rocky,
[00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.300]   "and you're about to change the world
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.260]   "with you and a whole bunch of other people."
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.620]   And so let me read one of the letters
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.220]   that he wrote to the church.
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.180]   And here's, Peter means Rocky, or Rock,
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.780]   in case you're like, "What is he talking about?"
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.300]   Here's where we're gonna be in chapter five,
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400]   starting in verse one.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.080]   Peter writes and says,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.780]   "To the elders, the leaders among you,
[00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.820]   "I appeal to you as a fellow elder
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.360]   "and a witness of Christ's sufferings,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.860]   "who will also share in the glory to be revealed.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.180]   "Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.080]   "watching over them, not because you must,
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.680]   "but because you're willing, as God wants you to be,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.220]   "not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve,
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.020]   "not lording it over those entrusted to you,
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.000]   "but being examples to the flock.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.260]   "And when the chief shepherd, Jesus, appears,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.380]   "you will receive the crown of glory
[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.540]   "that will never fade away.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.840]   "In the same way, you who are younger,
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.900]   "submit yourselves to your elders.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.440]   "All of you, clothe yourselves in humility
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.060]   "towards one another, because God opposes the proud,
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.880]   "but shows favor to the humble.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.780]   "Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand,
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780]   "that he may lift you up in due time.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.720]   "Cast all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you."
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.200]   Let me pray one more time, we'll dive in.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.140]   Father, thank you for your word, thank you
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.040]   that you take people like Simon Peter,
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.140]   who are broken, messed up people,
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.280]   and you allow them to step into a relationship with you
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.480]   and step out of wasting their life away
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.880]   and finding purpose and healing and hope,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.680]   and finding you.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.260]   Father, we pray that that would happen tonight,
[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.420]   that you would open eyes for anyone
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.460]   who doesn't have a relationship,
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.620]   that you would open all of our eyes
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   to just the truths contained in your word.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460]   You'd instruct our hearts, that you would allow
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.360]   just your word, which you say is sharper than anything,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.140]   to pierce into our hearts, to pierce into this heart,
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.000]   mine and my friend's hearts, and to transform us
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.100]   and make us more like Jesus.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.700]   Father, we love you, thank you for sending your son
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.360]   to die the death that we deserved,
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.660]   and allowing us, by his new life, to have lived a life
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.700]   that, apart from him, we could not live.
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.460]   Well, I went to the University of Texas A&M.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.300]   Any Aggies in this place?
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.940]   Oh my gosh, it's entirely Aggies.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.480]   Hello, breakaway.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.700]   So when I was at A&M, I did sports
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700]   for the first couple years there.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.680]   I did track, it was nothing impressive at all,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.060]   and I threw the javelin, which like six people
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.220]   on the planet do, so it's like me and you six guys.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.500]   And anyways, we had these sport advisors
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.420]   who would tell you or help you enroll you
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.540]   in the classes that you would take.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.140]   Basically, everybody who was involved
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.260]   in the athletic program, especially for like football players
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.460]   or different people, are like, we're gonna make sure
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.480]   you take the easiest electives we have.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.260]   So we're gonna go knitting on one,
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.540]   we're gonna go yoga class, and then agronomy
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.660]   was the one that I got handed.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.780]   So I'm gonna start by telling you
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.340]   about my experience in agronomy.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.140]   I know all you guys love agronomy.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.120]   What is agronomy?
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.660]   The study of the stars?
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.940]   No, it's not that, that's astronomy.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.500]   Agronomy is, it was agronomy 101,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.320]   and I got told by my advisor, this is gonna be your elective
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.700]   for the first semester, he go, agronomy is the study,
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.180]   or it's recreational turf grass.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.820]   Agronomy, yes, agricultural, Texas A&M,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.460]   agriculture mechanical, and they had an agronomy class,
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.500]   and it was me and essentially the football team,
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.740]   and we're in there, and you are learning
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.540]   about how grass grows.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.420]   So I am about to tell you what I learned
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.380]   over this entire semester in the next probably 35 seconds,
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.260]   and I'm gonna save you what I paid $3,000 for
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.060]   and give it to you right here.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.660]   Basically, here's what you study.
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540]   Hey, this is how grass grows, and these are the things
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.540]   that are essential and necessary,
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.900]   and the different types of grass, and how they can all grow.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.460]   And there's four things that are necessary
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.340]   for any grass to grow.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.980]   If grass, if you ever have it to grow,
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.800]   I'm about to save you.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.300]   I know everyone came in here tonight being like,
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.700]   please, talk about the grass.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.300]   And so I'm about to remove that and tell you,
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.340]   if grass is gonna grow, there's four things necessary.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.860]   Sunlight, I know you can write this down.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.460]   I see a lot of people.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.460]   Water, soil, and you gotta pick the weeds.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.820]   I'm gonna repeat them.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.700]   Sunlight, water, soil, you gotta pick the weeds.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.180]   I just saved you $3,000 right there.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.180]   Yeah, you're welcome.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.260]   Here's why I start with that.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.580]   In order for, (laughs)
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.780]   yeah, thank you, that's great, yeah, clap.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.540]   So in order for anything in this grass to grow,
[00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.220]   you had to have these four things, and that are essential.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.700]   If they were not present, the grass would not grow.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.900]   If there wasn't water, couldn't happen.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.660]   If it was like in a closet, you couldn't grow grass.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.620]   If you were trying to throw grass on concrete,
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.020]   it had to have soil, couldn't grow.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.940]   If you didn't pick weeds, it would choke out the grass
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.220]   and it wouldn't grow.
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.480]   Why would I start there?
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.460]   No reason at all.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.860]   I just had to get that off my chest
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.700]   and share it with somebody.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.520]   I'm totally kidding.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.020]   The reason I start there is because in the same way
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.700]   that there are four essentials that are required,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.180]   are necessary in order for growth to take place,
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.060]   and grass is life.
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.260]   All of us came in here tonight, especially for Christians,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.340]   if you're a Christ follower in the room,
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.620]   I'm talking especially to you,
[00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.620]   with a desire to grow, to grow spiritually.
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.220]   In other words, for Christ followers,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.100]   there probably isn't very many or any of us
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.500]   who came in the room who's like, you know what?
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.300]   I feel like I've reached the pinnacle of my growth.
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.220]   I don't need to know any more Bible.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.300]   I know all that I could possibly ever know
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.860]   or all that there is to know.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.700]   My prayer life, it's like me and Mother Teresa
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.020]   are on the same playing field here.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.020]   My service and my ministry impact,
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.500]   it eclipses anything else on this planet
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.300]   and like anything anyone has ever seen.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.220]   The very few or none of us come in here feeling like,
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.900]   man, there's no spiritual ground for me to take.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.020]   And if that is you, this message probably
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.300]   is not gonna be for you, so you're dismissed right now.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   But for the rest of us who came in saying,
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.580]   man, I want to grow, I want to experience
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.100]   spiritual growth in my life, that I do wanna see,
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.300]   I do wanna see my integrity grow,
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.420]   which happens whenever you spiritually grow
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.500]   and you grow more and more godly.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.300]   I do wanna grow in my knowledge of God's word,
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.440]   I do wanna be better at relationships,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.260]   which I know whenever I'm good at vertically
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.100]   I'm making sure that I love the Lord my God,
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.980]   that I become a better lover of my neighbor as myself.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.160]   That we all came in here with this desire
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.900]   to spiritually take it on and spiritually grow.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.580]   And just like in that agronomy class
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.820]   where we remove the mystery of,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.420]   hey, these things are always present,
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.480]   if growth is gonna take place,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.260]   there are certain things that Peter lays out
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.340]   in this passage that if you are going
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.180]   to experience spiritual growth,
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.660]   are essential in your life and in my life.
[00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.780]   Said otherwise, if the three things
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.340]   that we're gonna talk about are not present in your life,
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.380]   you will not spiritually grow.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.260]   And you're gonna wake up however many months from today
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.640]   and you're gonna look back and wish
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.700]   that you had began to implement the stuff that Peter says,
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.020]   or you're gonna begin to apply them
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.060]   and begin to see and experience growth.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.180]   It's not the exhaustive list of things,
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.420]   but if these are not present,
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.360]   just like sunlight with grass, you will not grow.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.060]   And Peter gives us very clear instructions
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.020]   on what those things are gonna be.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.100]   So we're gonna pick it up right where we stopped
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.000]   or right where we started at verse one of chapter five
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.900]   where Peter goes into his closing remarks to the church
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.340]   and we're gonna look at the three essentials
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.580]   that he lays out necessary for spiritual growth.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.700]   He talks about submission to godly leadership,
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.400]   clothing ourselves in humility towards God
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.380]   and towards others or towards other believers,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.000]   and then how we cast our anxiety, not carry it.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.260]   So we're gonna look at those three ideas
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.620]   and the three things that he says are necessary
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.540]   if you and I are going to experience growth
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.380]   inside of our life.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.980]   Let's pick it up back in verse one.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.220]   So he begins writing to the elders.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.220]   Elders is a word for pastor, leader.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.620]   He's writing, as you know,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.500]   a lot of the New Testament is letters.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   So if you have the New Testament,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.700]   which is the second half of the Bible, part two,
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.300]   a lot of it is made up of letters
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.620]   that were written by the apostles, the disciples and Paul,
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:37.700]   and they wrote these letters.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.060]   There's 21 letters out of the 27 books in the New Testament.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.180]   21 of them are these letters written to churches
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.140]   who are made up of new believers going,
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.220]   "How do I live out this faith?"
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.620]   And Peter and a lot of the boys wrote these letters saying,
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.420]   "Hey, this is what it looks like to follow Jesus."
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.220]   So now he begins addressing the specific leaders
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.940]   of the church that he's writing to,
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.780]   and here's what he says.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.660]   "To the elders, the leaders of this church,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.940]   "among you, I appeal to you as a fellow elder
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.660]   "and a witness of Christ's sufferings,
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.140]   "who will also share in the glory to be revealed."
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.980]   Like, hey, I'm in this, we're in this together
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.260]   as leaders of the church.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.420]   I'm telling you, be shepherds or care for God's flock
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.340]   that is under your care.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.500]   "Watching over them, not because you must,"
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.620]   so he's talking to the leaders,
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.060]   here's how I want you to lead your church,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.340]   "but because you're willing, as God wants you to be.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.980]   "Not pursuing dishonest gain,"
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.180]   don't do this to make more money,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.380]   to take advantage of people,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.020]   "but being eager to serve."
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.120]   He gives the call and the commands of leadership
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.720]   inside of the church.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.080]   "Not lording it over those who entrusted it to you,
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.860]   "but being an example that you lead by example to the flock.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.220]   "And when the chief shepherd,"
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.140]   like, reminder, leader of the church,
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.700]   you have a leader, Jesus,
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.340]   "and when he appears, you will receive the crown of glory
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.980]   "that will never fade away,"
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.060]   that it's gonna be worth it.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.540]   In the same way that there's something
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.580]   for the elders or the leaders of a church to do,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.260]   elders is the local leadership of a church.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.240]   In the same way, you who are younger,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.300]   or you could insert, hey, you friends at the porch,
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.760]   or you who are younger inside of their church,
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.540]   there's specific things for you to do.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.680]   Submit yourselves to the elders.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.920]   The first essential that he gives us for spiritual growth,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.200]   if you and I are gonna experience it,
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.960]   is that you and I are called to submit to God's leaders,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.480]   called to submit to God's leaders.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.040]   Now, here's what I know about you,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.940]   'cause I know it's true about me,
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.600]   and it's really just true about millennials in general,
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.720]   probably just Americans,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.720]   is like, submission in general and submission to authority
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.740]   are not a millennial's favorite word choice, if you will.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.040]   Like, probably not a lot of us have like a tattoo
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.760]   that says submit to authority.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.480]   It's just not something that we're really excited
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.560]   about doing around here,
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.080]   maybe 'cause there's been abuse of authority
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.240]   or different things that we've seen,
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.280]   but if you're a follower of Christ, this is not an option,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.480]   that you and I, me too, are called to submit ourselves
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.580]   to a local church group
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.900]   and the leadership of that local church,
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.280]   that if you and I are gonna experience growth,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.640]   the first idea is that you and I are called
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.740]   to submit to God's leaders.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.640]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.920]   I do not mean that you're called to attend a church.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.260]   I mean that you're called to be plugged in
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260]   or a member of a church.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.740]   If you attend here on a Tuesday,
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.440]   even if you attend on a Sunday, you're not a member.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.880]   You're an attender.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.200]   You and I are called to be members of a church,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.720]   whether that's here or another place.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.580]   If you're from another church, we're so glad you're here.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.360]   We're not trying to church steal or anything.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.940]   We hope you go deeper into wherever God has you,
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.380]   but all of us are called, if you're a Christ follower,
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.700]   to be members of a church.
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.100]   You and I are called to submit to a local leadership
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.000]   and be underneath the authority of elders around us,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.720]   just like grass wouldn't grow in that scenario
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.800]   unless it's under sunlight.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.600]   You will not grow unless you are under the authority
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.720]   of local leadership,
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.560]   unless you are underneath the authority
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.520]   of a local leadership.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.600]   Man, I missed this for so many years of my life.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.520]   I remember in college that there was never,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.800]   I never plugged into a church.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.140]   Like I would serve at different places,
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.640]   but I was disobedient to this passage,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.620]   to many passages inside of the New Testament
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.360]   that teach that you and I are called
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.920]   to be a part of a local church.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.400]   And there's an epidemic among millennials
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.440]   where they just church hop.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.480]   Hey, you kinda go to the village on Sunday,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.720]   you check out the porch on Tuesday,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.560]   maybe go to IBC or PCBC
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.320]   or any of these different initials out here,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.240]   and you kinda just check 'em out
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.040]   and they're kinda on the Rolodex and which one's up next.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.080]   And then I podcast this person and I listen to this person,
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.800]   and the scripture says you're living disobedient
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.840]   to what Christ's command is on your life.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.580]   Whether you're gonna plug in here or another place,
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.980]   if you are a Christian,
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.560]   you are called to be a part of a local church.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.520]   I'm gonna say it again and I'm just gonna hammer it
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.320]   and then give an illustration and we're gonna move on.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.520]   If you are not a member of a church,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   and you're a Christian,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.240]   you're living in disobedience
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.040]   to the clear commands in scripture.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.520]   And you may be hiding behind like some smoke screen,
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.640]   I'm trying to figure out my job,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.760]   and maybe, you know, and I wanna make sure I get married
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.120]   'cause then, you know, my boo may have a different church.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.540]   You're hiding behind a bunch of excuses.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.160]   And God's command is that you become a member of a church.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.520]   If it's not this one, there's lots of great ones,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.440]   but we're all called to get plugged in.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.800]   You will not grow if you're not connected to a local body.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.840]   And on the flip side, what's amazing is how much people grow
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.980]   whenever they get plugged into a local church.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.060]   Like I was talking to a buddy today
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.280]   who's one of our leaders,
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.720]   and we were hanging out a couple weekends ago
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.240]   at something called a porch leader retreat,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.160]   which we do a couple times a year.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.960]   We take the 10 or 12 leaders that lead the teams
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.800]   here at the porch.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.640]   There's 200 volunteers,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.560]   and they're over them at the Dallas campus.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.600]   They're amazing men and women.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.080]   And they, with our staff, just pull away,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.160]   and we spend the weekend.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.760]   And I was talking to one of the guys there,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.680]   and we were talking randomly.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.080]   He was sick, and we were talking about Advil,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.820]   and he was going into, and I was reminded of his story
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.120]   because in the midst of the Advil, he was like,
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.240]   "Yeah, I try not to take too many Advil
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.860]   "because I feel like I hit it pretty hard
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.960]   "on the old liver there for a number of different years
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.080]   "when I was back in college,"
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.280]   referring to just his story
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.720]   and the ways that he wasn't pursuing Christ,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.040]   but part of his past was just,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.960]   "Man, I was living for the party scene."
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.480]   It was either sex, alcohol, drugs, whatever it was,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.760]   until Christ captured his heart.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.640]   And I asked him today,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.480]   we were talking about some of his story,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.880]   and he said, "Man, there were so many times
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.560]   "I would come down front,
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.200]   "and I would talk to someone down there,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.100]   "and the same thing would happen every time.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.600]   "I'd basically come down and confess,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.300]   "and I'd be like, 'Yeah, I got wasted again this Friday.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.440]   "'Yeah, I got wasted this Friday.'"
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.460]   And finally, JP, he told me,
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.680]   "Man, when are you gonna go all in?
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.820]   "If you want to stop playing the game
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.960]   "and experience change, go all in."
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.600]   And it was in that moment, or when he decided to do that,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.160]   he submitted himself to a group of elders.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.840]   He joined this church.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.080]   And in submitting to the elders,
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.320]   you're like, "What does that mean here?
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.760]   "I'll give you what it means here."
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.420]   It means you follow the instructions
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.440]   that they have for the flock among you, or a flock here,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.280]   not because they're like,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.740]   "Oh, man, we need somebody to make us feel important
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.400]   "because they will stand before God
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.480]   "and give an account for the flock here."
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.840]   And some of the instructions they have
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.540]   is be in a community group, that you serve somewhere,
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:08.520]   that you have a annual kind of checkpoint with our staff
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.040]   to make sure, "How are we doing?"
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.620]   And annually, you agree, "Hey, I'm still in.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.240]   "I still want to be a member here."
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.600]   And in doing that, that's what it looks like
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.720]   to submit to the authority of Watermark,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.360]   to be a part of the elders' leadership here.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.520]   And in doing that, his life began to change.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.120]   Like, if you just do that,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.920]   if you just do that one thing,
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.860]   you're gonna experience growth because everything else,
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.700]   like, if you're connected,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.460]   if you go all in at a healthy church under godly leadership,
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.500]   you're gonna grow in your Bible knowledge.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.980]   You're gonna grow in your ability to talk about your faith.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.620]   You're gonna grow in the peace that you have over anxiety.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.840]   Maybe not overnight,
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.940]   but by submitting to the care of the elders here,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.740]   you're gonna step into being known by other people.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.380]   You're gonna step into using your gifts,
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.180]   not just consuming all the time, but contributing.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.860]   And you're gonna experience growth in your life.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.980]   And if you don't wanna grow,
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.000]   if you're like, man, I do not want to grow at all spiritually,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.360]   my goal is to maybe move a little bit backwards,
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.000]   the thing you have got to avoid, like the plague,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.660]   is becoming a member of a church.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.160]   And even if you're not avoiding it like the plague,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.280]   but you're just avoiding it in general,
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.960]   you are not going to grow
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.240]   if you don't submit to God's leadership
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.940]   inside of a local church.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.420]   Peter continues and tells us something else
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.480]   related to just that idea of humility or submitting.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.240]   He says this in second half verse five.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.780]   All of you, so now we talked about elders, young people,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:30.100]   everybody, clothe yourselves with humility
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.740]   towards one another,
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.280]   because God opposes the proud,
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.580]   but he shows favor to the humble.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.360]   Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.760]   that he may lift you up in due time.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.220]   That Peter says that you and I are every single day,
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.240]   if you're a Christian,
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.920]   you are to clothe yourselves in humility.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.160]   Our second idea from the text
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.040]   is that we are to clothe ourselves in humility
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.920]   towards God's people and God's timing.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.060]   I'll explain what I mean by that.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.640]   But he basically says, hey, every single day,
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.520]   just like he uses the verb that just means tie around you,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.360]   or to tie it on, that every day you wake up
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.800]   and just like you put on clothes,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.500]   you put on humility as you look at your day.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.300]   Very few of us probably have ever left the house
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.720]   without clothes and been like, oh my gosh,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   can't believe I forgot to put on clothes, gotta go back.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.000]   In the same way, Peter would say, hey,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.560]   you are to not leave the house every single day,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.360]   put on, just like you put on clothes,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.640]   put on humility towards one another
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.200]   and the way that you interact with one another
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.820]   and the way that you are humble towards God
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.280]   and his timing in your life.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.000]   And I think a lot of times humility can be misunderstood.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.640]   And as you've, if you've been with us,
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   heard us say before, an old C.S. Lewis quote,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.040]   which is just a Christian writer,
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.320]   that humility is not thinking about yourself
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.300]   or thinking less of yourself, like, man, I just hate me,
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.800]   or thinking more of yourself.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.960]   It's thinking about yourself less.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.160]   It's not thinking less of yourself, like, man, I hate me
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.640]   and I'm just so ugly and gosh, I'm not,
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.800]   I don't deserve anything.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.620]   It's not thinking about yourself.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.920]   The focus of your life is not on how bad you are,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.600]   how good you are, but just on others around you
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.240]   and the God that you serve.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.800]   And Peter says every single day,
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.080]   the posture of a Christian is to be one
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.400]   of being considerate towards other,
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.880]   of being humble towards others, humble towards God,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.000]   which we'll talk about in a second.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.800]   But what does it look like to be humble towards others?
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.480]   It looks like being considerate of the needs
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.040]   of other people around you.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.040]   It looks like being caring and serving
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.980]   other people around you, rather than seeking to be served,
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.400]   not to get, you know, praised as the servant,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.960]   but just because you see people as who they are,
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   made in God's image, the same God that you serve.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.080]   And Peter says, put this on every single day
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.280]   when you get up, seek to serve others around you.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.720]   The crazy thing about humility is like,
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.660]   humility looks good on everyone.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.580]   Like there's not a person in the room
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.820]   who if you are humble, are not gonna be more attractive.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.220]   Like if you can just learn to have a true,
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.620]   sincere posture of humility, if you're a person
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.580]   who's like, man, I'm not quick to like celebrate myself
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.420]   and how great I am and you know, me, me, me, me, me,
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.960]   enough about me, now you talk about me.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.540]   If you're not that person, but you're someone
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.740]   who's like, man, I'm quick to praise others,
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.620]   I'm quick to acknowledge just how much of my life
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.820]   is a gift from God and anything that's good there,
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.260]   I've really been so fortunate.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.520]   Like that person is so attractive.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.340]   The person who seeks to serve,
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.620]   the person who out of humility is like grateful
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.540]   for things in their life 'cause they're not entitled.
[00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.460]   The person who's out of humility, like not easily offended,
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.740]   they're quick to forgive.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.260]   Like you see, ever seen conflict between humble people?
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.660]   It's like the most boring thing ever.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.260]   It's like, man, I'm so sorry.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.700]   No, no, are you serious?
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.540]   No, this was me.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.180]   Are you, no, no, it was mainly me.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.100]   And it's like, oh my gosh, guys, seriously.
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.340]   You don't conflict much.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.620]   Humility is one of those things
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.460]   that makes life better and makes anyone who has it better.
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.840]   I mean, true story, fellas,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.240]   if you've been hit with the ugly stick,
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.400]   I can tell you one thing.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.480]   You will be more attractive to the ladies in this room
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.040]   if you are humble.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   (laughing)
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.880]   It's true.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.360]   Somebody told me this last week.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.200]   Dude, you got a face made for radio.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.880]   I was like, you're a mean, mean person.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.840]   That'll click.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.120]   And if you got a face made for radio,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.160]   I am confident you will be more attractive,
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.460]   you will be a more potential suitor
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.480]   if you can learn the art of humility
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.780]   that overflows from your relationship and love from Christ.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.500]   Just that's for free, okay?
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.960]   You can take that to the bank.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.080]   But it's true, it's the little black dress.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.560]   It looks good on everybody, regardless of who's wearing it.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.020]   Humility, it looks good every single time.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.200]   Ugly stick is not in my notes, I apologize.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.040]   (laughing)
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.800]   Let's just save the email.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.820]   And we're moving on.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.600]   And then he talks about not only humility towards others,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.760]   but humility towards God's timing.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.240]   Come back with me.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.520]   That humility doesn't just look like humility towards others,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.200]   but humility and trusting of God's timing.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.560]   Or one of the ways humility manifests itself
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.360]   is by trusting in God's timing inside of your life.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.280]   But what does he say?
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.600]   He says at the end of verse that God,
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.820]   by when we humble ourselves underneath his mighty hand,
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.860]   we trust and allow him to exalt him in due time.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.800]   That part of humility is trusting,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.040]   like God, you're in control.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   I'm gonna trust your timing inside of my life.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.320]   How much of young adulthood is spent not trusting
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.240]   or fighting against God for the timing
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.440]   that you don't think is playing out the way you want it to?
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.040]   I can speak from experience in my own life.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.080]   I mean, so much of my own struggles with humility
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.680]   are clearly going, God, when am I gonna move further
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.520]   down the road?
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.680]   I should be farther in my career.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.640]   I should make more money by now.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.540]   Maybe for you, it's like, hey,
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.320]   I should have been married already.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.880]   God, what are you doing?
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.960]   I should have, my biological clock is running out, God.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.400]   Are you gonna do something?
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.920]   Am I gonna get a promotion?
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.320]   Am I ever gonna own a home?
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.280]   Where am I gonna live once my roommate lives?
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.880]   And so much of humility is just saying,
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.040]   God, I'm gonna trust that you're in control.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.460]   I'm gonna trust your timing.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.720]   It's the word that Peter uses.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.480]   That you would trust humility
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.640]   is trusting the God who's in control,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.400]   who's moving the circumstances around.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.720]   That he's over my life
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.960]   and he's the one ultimately who's in control.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.280]   This one is probably easily the one that like,
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.100]   I wrestle with to a point where I don't even feel
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.880]   like I can truly preach it with integrity.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.760]   So I'll just say, man, I stink at this.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.800]   Join the crowd.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.920]   And I was with JP and Garrett who leads it in Fort Worth
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.920]   and we were doing a teaching retreat a couple months ago.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.160]   And we were planning out the year
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.920]   and we break away, go to somewhere,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.560]   whether it's a lake house
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.520]   or just a place of friends connection.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.720]   And we try to get away and plan out the year
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.880]   of the sermons and the series.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.560]   And throughout that time,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.120]   I just remember dialoguing and going,
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.880]   man, sometimes I feel like, oftentimes I feel like,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.740]   I'm like, I don't know if I should even stay in ministry.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.160]   I feel like I should be further down.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.040]   Maybe I should go lead a church like God.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.480]   I feel like, and I can immediately go,
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.720]   man, maybe I need to go into the business world
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.800]   or I should be elevated further along
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.040]   in my career path by now.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.500]   I should be making more money.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.040]   I should have a bigger house
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.920]   or whatever the different accomplishments.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.240]   And it's a pride that wells up in me
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.080]   that I would call, man, it's just discontentment
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.820]   and it's pride and it's evil and it's wicked.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.480]   And it's the thing that brings the opposition of God.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.440]   And Peter says, man, trust the God who's in the heavens.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.040]   You can trust his timing over your life.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.300]   You can voice and express the things
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.400]   that, man, you're disappointed.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.360]   You can be honest with God, but at the same time,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.600]   humble yourselves and say, I'm gonna choose God.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.160]   I trust your timing.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.160]   I can be honest in asking you
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.080]   to bring about certain things in my life,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.640]   but I'm gonna trust your timing above my own.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.360]   And Peter says, man, clothe yourself in humility
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.840]   and you'll experience growth.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.920]   Humility towards others, humility towards God.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.540]   And then he finishes and really connects
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:05.040]   to the idea of humility and so much of our future
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.880]   and the ways that we don't trust God's timing,
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.000]   which is called anxiety.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.200]   And here's what he says.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.160]   Cast all your anxiety, or casting,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.480]   it's a continuation, it's the same sentence.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.000]   And in the Greek, that word cast is casting.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.160]   So casting all, one of the ways we humble ourself
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.600]   is by casting all of our anxiety on him
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.400]   because he cares for you.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.800]   That just like in that lawn scenario,
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.080]   there were certain things required in order for it to go.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.360]   One of them was picking the weeds out.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.120]   That in order for your, I'm sorry,
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.640]   in order for the grass to grow,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.160]   that weeds had to be picked up and plucked and removed
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.520]   or they would choke out the grass.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.580]   And the same way as it relates to anxiety
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.480]   inside of your life.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.900]   The Bible doesn't say, hey, you'll never have anxiety ever.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.380]   It says, hey, when you are anxious,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.220]   there's something specific that you're to do.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.120]   Just like pulling weeds out so that the grass can grow,
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.280]   you and I are to cast out anxieties
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.720]   so that the faith that we have can continue to grow.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.240]   Casting them to a very specific place.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.400]   Our third idea from the text is just,
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.960]   we cast your anxieties, don't carry them.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.320]   You cast anxieties, you do not carry them.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.680]   If you want your faith to grow,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.520]   you cast your anxieties on the Lord,
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.960]   you do not carry them, Peter says.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.280]   Peter, like a fisherman who was very familiar
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.660]   with casting things or casting in our day,
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.520]   casting a net out, says you and I are called
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.880]   not to carry anxieties around,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.720]   but to cast them on the Lord,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.080]   surrender them and bring them to him.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.760]   Said another way that when I'm anxious,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.720]   God wants me to, his word tells me to,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.960]   bring to him the things I'm anxious about.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.400]   Bring to him through prayer.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.520]   God, you know what I'm facing today.
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.480]   You know the interview that I had.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.120]   You know that if this job doesn't work out,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.040]   that I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.720]   God, you know that I'm so tired of being single
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.640]   and I'm really hoping that something's gonna change.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.160]   God, you know that I'm not sure where I'm gonna live
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.000]   'cause my roommate's about to move out.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.660]   And you know that as I sit here, I'm anxious, Lord.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.120]   Will you help me to trust you?
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.840]   And Father, will you change this?
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.880]   He says, bring your anxieties for a very specific reason,
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.540]   because he cares for you.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.200]   And that little word care is a word
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.880]   that's almost stronger than the English word care.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.260]   It means you matter to God.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.260]   Not like you matter to God, but you matter to God.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.360]   Some of you, the most important thing
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.640]   you're gonna leave here with,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.920]   especially if anxiety's a part of your story
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.160]   or part of your struggle,
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.420]   is knowing that God cares about you.
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.140]   He cares about the things you're wrestling with.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.300]   He cares about the things that are making you anxious.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.880]   He cares about what's on your schedule tomorrow,
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.900]   that the God of the universe cares about you.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.360]   He cares enough to send his son to die for you.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.140]   Do you not think that he cares about the fact
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.700]   that your mom has cancer?
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.300]   And Peter says, cast all your anxieties on him.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.140]   He cares you.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.900]   When you get anxious, so much of our tendency
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.460]   is to hold onto it ourself
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.420]   and try to carry it ourself.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.920]   Peter says, you're not strong enough to carry it.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.580]   The God of the universe is saying,
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   bring your anxieties to me.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.060]   Why, because I won't know about 'em unless you do?
[00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.620]   No, I'm God, I know everything,
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.560]   but the reality is your heart and yourself
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.140]   will begin to change if the reaction to the struggles,
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.560]   the problems, the fears that you face in life
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.920]   goes from, I'm just gonna hold on to this,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.340]   I'm gonna turn it, to going, God,
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.820]   you know what I'm facing, I'm gonna turn it,
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.260]   I'm gonna give this to you.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.700]   Will you help me right now?
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.060]   And Peter says, when you do that,
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.580]   you cast out anxiety and your faith begins to grow.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.860]   You're not strong enough to carry it.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.140]   My son is, I have a 17-month-old son
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.620]   who's in this stage right now where everything,
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.820]   he wants to pick up everything and carry it around.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.900]   He refuses to ask for help for anything,
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.940]   so he just goes around,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.300]   and not only does he want to pick everything up,
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.140]   he goes ballistic whenever he doesn't get to pick it up,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.620]   'cause we're terrible parents, apparently.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.140]   And so he will go around
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.540]   and he'll try to pick up different things.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.580]   I'm like, buddy, you can't pick that up,
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.420]   and then he'll just lose it.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.100]   It's like, hey, buddy, you can't pick up the dog.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.140]   He weighs four times as much as you do.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:02.380]   And he'll just go ballistic.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.620]   Last night, we were trying to get out the door
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.900]   to this banquet that we were going to,
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.060]   and the babysitter, we had a new babysitter showing up,
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.660]   and we're going, and we're getting everything ready,
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.860]   and our son is kinda outside playing,
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.740]   and he's trying to pick up this toy that he has
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.100]   that's way too heavy, and so I go and I grab him,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.780]   and he just begins to lose it.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.980]   And the babysitter's right here for the very first time,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.660]   I'm like, hey, everything's fine, it's gonna be great.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.500]   You're gonna love this kid.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.900]   And I'm like, man, buddy, just let me carry it.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.660]   You're not strong enough.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:35.360]   Peter says that whatever you're facing,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.260]   and man, I have such compassion for anxiety.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:45.120]   My wife, it's very a part of her story,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.420]   and she's seen incredible victory,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.940]   but I know for a lot of us in the room,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.260]   anxiety can just be something that owns and grips us.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.780]   And Peter says whatever you're facing,
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.820]   you're not strong enough to hold onto it.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.480]   You're not strong enough to carry it,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.940]   but there is one who is, will you bring it to him?
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.340]   And in doing so, you cast out the anxiety,
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.380]   and even then, you're declaring,
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.060]   God, I trust you, and your faith will grow.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.620]   That God, in the moments where I'm tempted to despair
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.940]   'cause I don't know what I'm gonna do about my job,
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:18.900]   I don't know who I'm gonna marry,
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.880]   I'm just overwhelmed, I'm anxious right now,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.500]   I'm not even sure why I'm anxious,
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.380]   but God, you know, and you're in control, I trust you.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.140]   I don't know what tomorrow holds.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.580]   I know that you hold tomorrow.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.580]   You hold all things, and I'm gonna bring those to you,
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.620]   and even in that, you're showing your faith,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.780]   you're flexing your faith.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.500]   Peter says don't carry your anxieties,
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.060]   cast them off to the God who cares for you.
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.180]   Here's what's so crazy about anxiety,
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.780]   is it will choke your faith.
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:56.420]   Like only one of anxiety or faith can grow at the same time.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.580]   Jesus, in Matthew 13, even says this,
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.460]   that hey, if you want your faith to get choked out
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.500]   or to not grow, if you allow anxiety around it,
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.760]   we'll choke that out.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.140]   And further, what's interesting,
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.940]   is that anxiety, stay with me,
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.940]   anxiety and faith require the same soil to grow in,
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.760]   uncertainty.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.420]   Like in other words, you cannot have faith
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.640]   without uncertainty,
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.040]   'cause that's just called seeing or sight.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.900]   You cannot have faith without uncertainty,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.680]   you cannot have anxiety without uncertainty.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.460]   The very same circumstances
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.220]   under which anxiety shows up and flares up
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.980]   is the very same circumstances
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.740]   where faith shows up, uncertainty.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.800]   Why does that matter?
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.940]   Oh, that's an interesting observation,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.100]   because here's what it means.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.860]   The very same circumstances today,
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.780]   if you were anxious today,
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.100]   if anxiety is a part of your story,
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.060]   if anxiety is something that you wrestle with,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.660]   the very same things that cause anxiety in your life
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:05.820]   are the places that God wants to lead
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.620]   and grow your faith to,
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.620]   so that a moment where you normally get anxious,
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:12.760]   faith shows up.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.840]   The very same circumstances, I'm on the plane,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.160]   the plane starts going down,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.560]   in a moment where I normally would be like,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.120]   oh my gosh, I'm gonna lose it,
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.520]   all of a sudden I'm filled with faith,
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.000]   my God is in control.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.060]   And that's an extreme one,
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.240]   maybe for more that hits at home,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.880]   the very same moments where you're at work or your job,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.280]   or you're not sure what's gonna happen
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:32.160]   in the midst of your family,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.200]   maybe they're divorcing,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.540]   where anxiety wells up,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.520]   those are the moments
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.200]   that God, if you will let him lead you there,
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.120]   wants to eventually bring you to a place
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.040]   where instead of anxiety showing up in uncertainty,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.840]   faith shows up,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.480]   because it's the same places that they grow,
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.460]   uncertainty,
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:54.760]   and the God who is there wants to grow them in your life,
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.120]   he does not want you to carry anxiety,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.760]   he wants you to cast them on him.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.800]   Inside of this room, there's gonna be two stories,
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.300]   I'm gonna land the plane here.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.720]   There's two paths that people are gonna come in,
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.720]   for Christians in the room,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.480]   there's those of us who would come in
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.840]   and you're not a member of a church,
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.520]   you're not gonna get plugged into a church,
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.920]   you're gonna leave here and kind of continue jumping around
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.800]   and attending different places,
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.320]   but you will never submit to authority.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.680]   You're not gonna clothe yourselves in humility,
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.200]   and listen to others and be subject to elders,
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.320]   and you're in the face of anxiety,
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.760]   you're not gonna turn to God,
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.360]   and your faith is not gonna grow, it's gonna die,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.200]   or it's gonna be frozen from where you are now,
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.440]   until when you decide to do those things.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.760]   And then there's others,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   who would decide or have already decided,
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.440]   I'm gonna submit myself to elders,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.500]   I'm gonna step under the leadership of a church,
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.840]   because the church is perfect,
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.840]   no, there's no such thing as a perfect church,
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.120]   but because it's part of God's plan
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.080]   for me experiencing growth,
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.700]   and it's a command,
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.400]   and I'm gonna seek to be humble every day,
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.400]   put on humility, to allow others to speak into my life,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.320]   to listen, be slow to speak, do whatever I can,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.520]   be humble towards other believers and others in general,
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.640]   and humble towards my God,
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.640]   that God, I'm gonna choose to trust you,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.440]   and there's gonna be moments where I don't want to,
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   but I'm gonna choose to voice, God, I don't want to,
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.360]   will you help me trust you, and trust your timing,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.480]   and I'm gonna bring my anxieties when they well up,
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.240]   I'm gonna bring them to you,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.840]   not just hold onto them,
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.720]   but bring them to the God who says, I care for you,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.040]   will you cast them on me, I'm strong enough.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.160]   In that class, we would go and you'd see grass,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.360]   and you would try to evaluate,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.920]   or you would be a part of the class,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.960]   was evaluating like, hey,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.160]   which of the four essentials was not present
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.920]   that led to the grass not growing, if it was dead?
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.440]   So you're like, was it water, was it this?
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.460]   And you do an assessment, if you will.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:13.200]   Inside of the room, the spiritual assessment,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:14.400]   Peter puts before us,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.040]   in that if you're gonna experience growth,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.800]   you've gotta examine, it's going, hey,
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.120]   and you can like go, I'm not taking your assessment, great,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.420]   well, I'll just put the questions out there.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.640]   Are you a part of a local church?
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.800]   Are you underneath the authority of elders,
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.360]   who will stand before God, and give an account for you?
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.500]   Are you seeking to clothe yourselves in humility,
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.440]   with other believers, allowing them to speak in your life,
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.880]   serving and using the gifts God's given you,
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.020]   to walk humbly?
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.240]   Are you seeking to trust his timing,
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.280]   and casting your anxieties on him?
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.560]   If you're not, you're not gonna grow,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:58.120]   and your faith will freeze,
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.320]   and you'll look back to this moment,
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.420]   and either wish you would have started,
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.400]   what hopefully someday you will,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.280]   or you'll look back, and say, man, I kept going,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.480]   I was doing those things, and I kept going,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.800]   and my faith has strengthened and grown,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.480]   and in the face of uncertainty,
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.360]   I have a God who I follow, and I cast my anxieties on.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.960]   Let me pray.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.920]   Father, thank you.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.520]   God, that you care for us.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.680]   Would that truth alone, if nothing else,
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.080]   seep in the hearts of maybe our friends in here,
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.960]   who don't have a relationship with you,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.840]   who are not sure where they stand with you.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.920]   Would they know that the God who sits in heaven,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   when he looks down, doesn't see them,
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.100]   and think, when are you gonna get it together,
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.800]   but feels compassion and care towards them,
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.900]   and longs to know him,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.400]   longs not for them to try to work their way,
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.320]   or do something for them,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   but trust in what you've done for them,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.360]   by dying in their place.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.000]   Father, would you take ground in those of us
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.040]   who have anxiety, just as a part of our current reality,
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.080]   or just as a part of our wiring, or whatever it is,
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:19.960]   Lord, would you help us to trust in you,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.760]   would we take things to you, and surrender those things,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.240]   and find your peace and your grace sufficient,
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.520]   your powers made perfect in weakness,
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.500]   and Father, where we are weak,
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.560]   would you be strong as you promise you are.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.660]   Father, would my friends who are not submitted
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.660]   to the authority of the church,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.820]   as they claim the name of Christ,
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.820]   would the spirit of God press hard on their hearts right now,
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.780]   and move them quickly to join and be a part
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.560]   of being the church,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.020]   and being a part of just your design,
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.300]   for which we would be cared for.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.780]   Thank you that you have sent the chief shepherd,
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.100]   our savior Jesus, to die in our place,
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.120]   and you call out to all of us to come,
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.840]   experience your love, your care,
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.800]   and to come to the altar of the God who lives.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.660]   We worship you now in song, amen.
