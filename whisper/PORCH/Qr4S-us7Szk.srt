00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,800
 All right, Porsche, how we doing?

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 We doing okay tonight?

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 Amazing.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,800
 Hey, it's so great to be here with you.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,000
 Thanks for making the time to join us here.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,200
 Those of you that are in the room,

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
 it's always a pleasure to spend a little bit of time with you.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
 But all of you that are tuning in online,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 thanks for giving us your evening as well.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,200
 We're so grateful to be a part of a generation where God is

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,400
 doing something really significant.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,200
 That's kind of what we've been journeying through as we've

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,800
 been looking at this series.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
 But before I get ahead of myself,

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,100
 let me give a special shout out,

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,300
 not just to those of you tuning online,

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,100
 but also Portslie, Greater Lafayette, Fresno, and Scottsdale.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,700
 God is doing a great thing here.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,200
 He is doing a great thing in so many different places,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
 and we're just glad to be a part of it.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,000
 Hey, let me just lead off with this.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,200
 The topic that we're working through tonight is of considerable

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,100
 importance. And because that's the case,

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,700
 I don't necessarily want us to rush all the way through it.

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,600
 I sat down and I considered, man,

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
 what can I cut from this thing?

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
 And I had others do the same alongside of me.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,500
 And we said, no,

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
 there's not much here that we feel like we can discard.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,200
 We believe that God wants to speak to you from the passage

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
 we're going to study.

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,500
 And it might just take a little bit of time,

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,800
 but sometimes things deserve an extended opportunity for the

37
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,300
 Lord to work.

38
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,600
 But before I get there,

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
 let me just open up with a story.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,300
 You might be sitting there thinking to yourself,

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,700
 "Kylin, did you get a little sun this weekend?"

42
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,400
 And the answer would be, "Yes, I did get some sun this weekend,

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
 but not by way of how most people would.

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,900
 I wasn't sitting by the pool.

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,800
 I wasn't sipping something nice.

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,300
 I wasn't working on my tan."

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,000
 You see, this white boy,

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,100
 he burns much faster than you might think.

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,900
 I was actually outside working on a construction project that

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,100
 I've taken upon myself.

51
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,600
 I am trying to build a covered pergola for my back patio,

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
 which has been awesome.

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,600
 I enjoy working with my hands.

54
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,200
 It's been great for me to dust off some of the old skills that

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,900
 I developed on the old family farm in East Texas.

56
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,500
 And it's been cool to work through some problems that I've

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,200
 encountered as I've been trying to bring my vision into reality.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,300
 It's always fun to measure twice and cut once and realize,

59
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,200
 "Man, I should have measured three times to try to figure out

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,300
 what's the alternative solution."

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,500
 There's something really rewarding in looking at what you're

62
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,100
 building by way of the sweat of your brow.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,500
 You know, like I have enjoyed this process and by way of me

64
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,600
 doing it on my own,

65
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
 I am saving a lot of money,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,100
 which is just a small addition to why this matters.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,600
 You see, it has not financially cost me nearly what it would if

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,200
 I had contracted it out and had someone come do it instead.

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,500
 But, and there's a big but here, it has cost me nonetheless.

70
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,200
 What do I mean by that?

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,400
 You see, this is not just your run-of-the-mill, average

72
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,100
 Saturday afternoon chore where you roll up your sleeves and

73
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,000
 you give it the good college try for a few hours.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
 That's not what we're talking about here.

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,700
 This is a major construction project, the likes of which has

76
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,200
 led me to become a Home Depot Pro member.

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,100
 One where I'm not just building something that is constructed,

78
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,300
 but I'm also running electric.

79
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,200
 I'm trying to prepare something, the likes of which we will

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,100
 enjoy, not just for a little while, but for a long while.

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,100
 And because that's the case, it has cost me far more than I

82
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,300
 ever expected whenever I initially agreed to this.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,900
 It has cost me, in the realm of long weekends where I could

84
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,600
 be doing other things, but instead I'm doing this.

85
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,800
 It has cost me hours outside of the gym.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
 It has cost me one Memorial Day trip to the lake.

87
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,900
 And if I'm not careful, it's going to cost me something

88
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,400
 that's happening on July 4th too.

89
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,400
 I have to work quickly because this project is costing me

90
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,000
 at a level I did not expect.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,300
 So then why do I keep doing it?

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,700
 Because there's not much return on value for a half-finished

93
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,500
 patio cover when it comes to property value.

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,200
 You know, like I need to make sure that I get it done.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,800
 But in addition to that, what I'm learning is that there

96
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,500
 are some things worth a considerable cost.

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,800
 I'm realizing like the hope of what we'll be hosting friends

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,300
 over and sitting out on our back patio as the sun goes down

99
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,100
 and enjoying dinner.

100
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
 That's something I'm really looking forward to.

101
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,600
 Or getting it done in time for the fall so I can watch college

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
 football with other friends and we can enjoy the cool of

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
 the evening in America's favorite pastime.

104
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,900
 I'm looking forward to or the dream of hanging up my son's

105
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,100
 baby swing on the I-beam that goes over the front of it

106
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
 is exciting.

107
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,600
 These are things that help me to look at all that it is

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
 requiring me, how much a cost I'm actually incurring in

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,700
 saying this project is worth it.

110
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,900
 Anyways, the vision of what I have one day is well worth

111
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,300
 the value of what I'm losing right now.

112
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
 Why do I tell you all that?

113
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,100
 Because in the Christian life, there are seasons of time,

114
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,900
 chapters that you will live where you voluntarily endorse

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,900
 some considerable cost for a very considerable purpose.

116
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,800
 Just like no one was forcing me to build this patio.

117
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,000
 I could have hired it out.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,800
 You too will want to build something in your life, but it

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 will cost you.

120
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 It will require you to opt into inconvenience.

121
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,700
 It will force you to give up some measure of comfort and

122
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,600
 it's ultimately going to put you in a position where you

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,000
 self-select out of what you could have in order to have

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,100
 what you want to have.

125
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,300
 So what is it that you might build?

126
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,500
 You're going to build a consecrated life, a consecrated

127
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,700
 life, which is a life of uncommon devotion to God.

128
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,100
 That's what consecration is.

129
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,600
 Not a word that we use very frequently today, something

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
 you probably haven't read aside from the scriptures themselves.

131
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,000
 And yet there is something worth building into your life,

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,600
 which is called consecration and it is defined as an uncommon

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
 devotion to God.

134
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,100
 And the emphasis as we talk about that definition is really

135
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,900
 in the word uncommon because although there are seasons of

136
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,200
 consecration riddled throughout the scriptures, there are

137
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,800
 very few seasons of consecration riddled throughout our lives.

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,200
 It is a normality when you open the pages of this book, but

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,200
 it's an abnormality when you consider the pages of your

140
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,800
 story.

141
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,700
 And the reason for that is really understandable.

142
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
 Consecration is hard.

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,900
 It's hard, not just hard to learn about.

144
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,700
 That's actually not as difficult, but it is a very hard

145
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,400
 thing to live.

146
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,500
 It's a hard thing to apply.

147
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,900
 You see, we live in a society that is saturated by and are

148
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,300
 part of a generation that is infatuated with comfort, whether

149
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,600
 it's skipping anything longer than a six-second advertisement

150
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,700
 on your favorite YouTube video or making sure that your

151
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,400
 groceries are only available at curbside so you never actually

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,200
 have to walk inside the store or raging against Apple because

153
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,100
 how dare they only release one episode every single week.

154
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,600
 I want all of the episodes right now.

155
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,400
 We have become incredibly comfortable in our culture.

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,700
 And listen, I'm not self-righteous about this.

157
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,300
 I'm not a hater to this reality.

158
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,700
 I love the fact that I can prime anything I need to my door

159
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,000
 at this moment.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,600
 And yet we live in a comfort culture that is selling our

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,800
 generation on the idea that stress is bad.

162
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,700
 That anything less than good must be toxic.

163
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,100
 And if you're struggling, you should stop.

164
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,400
 That's what our culture is telling us.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
 And that's just not true.

166
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,500
 In fact, what we know is it's actually false.

167
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,100
 The scriptures would tell us that anything worth having is

168
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,700
 going to require something of you.

169
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,400
 And that which is most worthy of having, which is God himself,

170
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,300
 that which we would love to lay our hands upon, is worthy of

171
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,600
 giving up as much as we can in order to grab hold of him.

172
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,900
 You see, the life that you want is not the life that the world

173
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,500
 is promising.

174
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,200
 It's not a life of comfort and ease.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,300
 That life that's brimming with potential, that's boasting

176
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,800
 really great promise, that's packed with all the kind of

177
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,500
 passion you want to characterize your story, the life that

178
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,900
 Jesus has come to give you.

179
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,600
 And yet the life that so often we settle so much less for,

180
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,800
 that life, it comes by way of consecration, not by way of

181
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,500
 comfort.

182
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 And so tonight I want to talk to you about this idea of

183
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,300
 consecration.

184
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,800
 I want to help you understand how do you actually live into

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,500
 this kind of reality where you can experience the sort of

186
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,600
 life that so many of us want for.

187
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,900
 In order to do it, we're going to look at what the Apostle

188
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,300
 Paul says in his letter to Timothy.

189
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,000
 So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to 2 Timothy

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 chapter 2. While you're doing that, we've been in a series

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,600
 called Revive, where we're studying the principles of personal

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,400
 renewal. And the reason why we've been looking at personal

193
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,800
 renewal is because we're firm believers that you do not find

194
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,100
 revival by seeking revival.

195
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,600
 You find revival by seeking renewal. As we've been saying,

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
 it's sort of a tagline of this series, which has been adopted

197
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
 from smarter revivalists than myself.

198
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,300
 I would not even dub myself as such. What we believe is that

199
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,000
 widespread revival begins with inner renewal. And we're seeing

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
 it. Like this is happening, not just in our nation, it's

201
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,300
 happening all around the globe.

202
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,800
 You can look back at past weeks and see all the statistics

203
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,600
 that we've rolled up.

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 But what we understand is there is a genuine surge of

205
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,700
 spirituality where God is doing something significant in

206
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,200
 the lives of people just like yourself.

207
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,200
 But what's fascinating about it is he's not just calling people

208
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,100
 back to the faith and reigniting their love for Jesus.

209
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,800
 No, it actually goes further than just that. Because what

210
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,500
 we're seeing is individually people are returning to the

211
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,700
 church. They're committing to study the scriptures.

212
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,800
 They're getting baptized, which may not feel important to

213
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,300
 you, but it's very important because what it does is it

214
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,900
 articulates the idea that inner renewal leads to revival.

215
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,400
 Because what we're seeing is that people are being moved by

216
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,400
 God and not in the public places through a massive event or

217
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
 some sort of emotional upheaval.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
 That's not where he's moving most. Where he's moving most

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,300
 is in the secret places, the places of your heart.

220
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,900
 Now as I say that, I know you're like, well, Kylin, isn't

221
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,800
 this a massive event?

222
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,700
 Aren't we a part of a giant spectacle? Won't we likely

223
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,400
 experience some sort of emotional upheaval? You might,

224
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,000
 but here's the thing that I want you to know. Though God

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,600
 might begin the process of renewal here, that process does

226
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,300
 not end here. It must go with you. It has to leave these

227
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,800
 doors and it must engage with you in the regular day-to-day

228
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,300
 rhythms of your life.

229
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,500
 You see, God is moving in a way that we should want for.

230
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,300
 And I've said this and I'm saying it to you again tonight.

231
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,200
 Like I am unapologetic in my desire for more of God here

232
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,400
 at The Porch. God has done a good thing for the last 20

233
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,600
 years. And yet I believe that the best things are even still

234
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,300
 ahead of us. That every day with God can be better than

235
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,000
 the last day with God. I want him for myself.

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I want him for you. I want him for this room.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,300
 I want him for our city.

238
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,700
 I want him for our generation.

239
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,400
 But the way you get more of God

240
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
 is you give more of yourself.

241
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,500
 The way you get more of God is you give more of yourself.

242
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,400
 That's the idea behind consecration. Like it's not just

243
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,800
 giving up aspects of your life. It is giving up the entirety

244
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,200
 of your life to God. I like the way that Adrian Rogers puts

245
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,800
 it. He says, "Consecration is not giving God anything.

246
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,500
 It is taking your hands off of that which already belongs

247
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 to him." Which can feel really intimidating to consider.

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,200
 Like that's a bold claim. And yet as we consider the claim

249
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 of consecration, Paul is going to walk us through a series

250
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,600
 of steps we can take so that way it becomes true in our

251
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,900
 life. So that way we can let go of some of the things in

252
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,700
 this life. That way we might grab hold of more of God for

253
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,900
 our lives. And the reason we're looking at his letter

254
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,100
 to Timothy is he is writing this as sort of his swan song.

255
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,700
 You see, 2 Timothy is Paul's last letter ever written.

256
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,000
 He's sort of on his deathbed and he is pinning this moment

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
 to his protege and he's wanting to communicate to him a

258
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,700
 variety of important things. But dead center of the letter

259
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,700
 is this call to consecration. He's looking at Timothy

260
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,700
 and he's saying, "Hey, you, a young adult, someone in

261
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,400
 your mid to late 30s that's running a really big organization

262
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
 and facing a lot of people problems within your midst."

263
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
 Sound like anybody you know? There are a few things you

264
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,700
 need to focus on. They'll ultimately lead you from the

265
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,400
 life you have to the kind of life that God wants. And so

266
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,300
 he leads off and he says, 2 Timothy chapter 2 verse 20,

267
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,500
 "Now in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold

268
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honorable

269
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,100
 use, but some for dishonorable." You see, Paul tells him

270
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,000
 that in God's house, there are two different types of

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,500
 vessels. There are honorable vessels and there are

272
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,000
 dishonorable vessels. What does he mean by that? Well,

273
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,500
 it's interesting. There's not a clear consensus when

274
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,100
 it comes to the interpretation of what Paul specifically

275
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,300
 means. There's a wide debate, but most scholars land

276
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,800
 in one of two places whenever it comes to this subject.

277
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,500
 They either believe that Paul is speaking about true

278
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,700
 and false believers, that in the church, not only in

279
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,300
 Ephesus, but in rooms like our own or in the church

280
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
 that you attend, there are going to be people that

281
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,100
 ardently follow after Jesus and there are going to be

282
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,000
 people that do not follow after Jesus at all. That's

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,400
 one interpretation. The other interpretation is that

284
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,500
 Paul is speaking about two different statuses of

285
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,700
 believer. Don't think varsity versus JV, that there's

286
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,400
 one group of believer that's better than another.

287
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
 That's not what he's saying. What you should instead

288
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,700
 think is that there's one group of believers that

289
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,400
 are more committed than the other. It's like full-time

290
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
 employees versus part-time employees. Whatever your

291
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,700
 interpretation is, the result is still the same. Paul

292
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,600
 is telling us that the goal of your life is to be a

293
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,400
 vessel of honorable use. Why is that? Because the

294
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,600
 kind of vessel you are directly correlates with the

295
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,900
 kind of purpose you have. The kind of vessel you are

296
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,600
 directly correlates with the kind of purpose you

297
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,700
 have. So in my house, the most honorable vessel that

298
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,200
 we own is the fine china from our wedding. You know,

299
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,900
 that thing that people spend an exorbitant amount

300
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,400
 of money on that you never actually seem to use.

301
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,500
 That's the finest piece of dishware we have. It's

302
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,700
 the most honorable vessel we use, and we only use

303
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,300
 it for our most distinguished house guests. And so

304
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,200
 honorable is this vessel that we never put it in

305
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,300
 the dishwasher. No, no, no. How dare we consider

306
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,400
 such a thing? We always hand wash every single

307
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,800
 plate. We hand dry every single plate. And if it

308
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
 doesn't go back in the cabinet, it probably goes

309
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 back in the box. Like this is the most honorable

310
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,200
 vessel we have. If you were to walk in my home and

311
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,700
 I chose instead to serve you with paper plates,

312
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,200
 that would communicate something different about

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,400
 the level of importance in our evening. What it

314
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,700
 would say is that this vessel is not nearly as

315
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,800
 honorable as the last. Therefore, this moment must

316
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
 not be as honorable as the last. You see, the kind

317
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,100
 of vessel correlates to the kind of purpose. Now,

318
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,000
 could I use paper plates for our most distinguished

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,600
 dinners? Yes, I can, but I don't want to. That's

320
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,300
 what Paul's getting at. You see, Paul is articulating

321
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,600
 our first point that although God can use any

322
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,700
 kind of person, he wants to use a consecrated

323
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,700
 kind of person. Although God can use any kind of

324
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,700
 person, he wants to use a consecrated kind of

325
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,100
 person. Like it's true. He can use anybody he

326
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,200
 wants, and he does it all throughout his scriptures.

327
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,600
 He uses the prostitute Rahab. He chooses a

328
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,300
 rebellious prophet in Jonah. He grabs a real

329
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,800
 like a real swindler in Jacob, and he moves and

330
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
 he grabs a murderous religious man in Saul, and

331
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,400
 he uses them all for his purposes. He can use

332
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,800
 anybody he wants, but God wants to use people

333
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,000
 that want to be used by him. God wants to be used.

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,500
 He wants to use people that want to be used by

335
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,900
 him. That's what 2 Chronicles 16 9 says. It says,

336
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,700
 "For the eyes of the Lord they run to and fro

337
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,000
 throughout the whole earth to give strong support

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 to those whose heart is blameless toward him."

339
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
 That verse is certainly written at a very specific

340
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
 moment in Israel's history, and yet the principle

341
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,800
 still remains true today. God is searching for a

342
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
 people that he can give strong support to. What

343
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,900
 is the criteria for that people? The criteria

344
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,600
 for that people is not impressiveness. It's

345
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,700
 blamelessness, which is encouraging to me. Like

346
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,000
 we live in a culture of mega church pastors and

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,300
 Christian influencers, and yet what we're encouraged

348
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,800
 by is that our spiritual inferiority by way of

349
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,600
 we don't look as cool, or we don't sound as cool,

350
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 or we're not quite as articulate as they are, or

351
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
 we're not as greatly gifted as they are. All of

352
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 that inferiority is pushed aside and done away

353
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,500
 with because God is not worried about anointing

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,600
 the particularly gifted. He uses them for sure,

355
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
 but he is particularly specific about anointing

356
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,100
 the blameless. That's what he cares about. He

357
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,800
 wants to use blameless people. What does that

358
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,400
 even mean? Blamelessness is the avoidance

359
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
 of the appearance of evil. That's what it is,

360
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,500
 which can feel like an impossible target to hit.

361
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,600
 Kylan, I'm not blameless. Like even when I do

362
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,500
 my best, like even when I wake up in the morning

363
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,100
 and I have the best of intent for my day, I still

364
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,900
 stumble and fall. I do things I know that I'm

365
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,200
 not supposed to do. God knows that. God isn't

366
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
 looking at you and saying, "Hey, I'm looking for

367
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,700
 a perfect people." No, he is looking for a

368
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,100
 blameless people, a people that persist in their

369
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,600
 desire for spiritual improvement. That's what

370
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
 he wants, a people that are avoiding even the

371
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 appearance of evil. That's why he says we must

372
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,300
 cleanse ourselves in verse 21. He says, "Therefore

373
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,000
 if anyone cleanses himself from what is

374
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,300
 dishonorable, he will be a vessel of honorable

375
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,700
 use." Anybody in here ever mistakenly loaded a

376
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,300
 clean dishwasher full of dirty dishes? Like you

377
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,400
 decided, "I think this is all dirty." And so you

378
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,300
 grab a bunch of dirty dishes from the sink and

379
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,600
 you put them in only to learn, "No, that was

380
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,100
 clean." Has that ever happened to you? That has

381
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
 happened to me. What do you do in that moment?

382
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,300
 You don't carefully inspect every single item.

383
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,200
 Look at all the utensils to see which ones are

384
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,900
 dirty. You don't do that. Why? Because the danger

385
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,200
 of putting that dishonorable fork in your mouth

386
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,900
 is one that you cannot bear. And so you rerun

387
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,500
 the whole load. It's not worth the risk. That's

388
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,300
 what we must do whenever it comes to our personal

389
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,700
 contamination. We must likewise cleanse ourselves

390
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,600
 in so fervent a way. So how do we do that? Well,

391
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,700
 Paul talks to us about a couple of different

392
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,900
 things we can do over the course of his letters.

393
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,800
 I'm going to try to synthesize here in this

394
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,300
 moment. We talked about this a lot last week.

395
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,100
 And so you can go reference the sermon from

396
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
 just a week ago. But here right now, I want to

397
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,000
 tell you four things you can do to help you

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,700
 cleanse yourself. Here's what they are. You need

399
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,600
 to assess the who, the what, the when, and the

400
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,000
 where of your defilement. We'll go through them

401
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,800
 one by one. You need to assess the who. Like we

402
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,700
 need to consider what kind of contaminating

403
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,100
 company are we keeping? Who is it that we're

404
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,200
 spending time around, that we're frequenting

405
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,400
 the presence of, that does not actually uplift

406
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,800
 our souls but drags us into unnecessary sin?

407
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,100
 Where are we making rationalizations for the

408
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,600
 relationships in our life? Because well, they're

409
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,300
 my friends or that's my community group. When

410
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,800
 in reality, all it's doing is desensitizing

411
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,900
 you to the things that God cares about. Where

412
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,000
 is that happening in your story? Let me just

413
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 say, this does not mean that we should

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,700
 distance ourselves from sinners. No, we draw

415
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,200
 near to sinners. We ourselves are sinners, but

416
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,000
 those that don't know God, we come close to

417
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,400
 them too. Jesus loved being around sinners. He

418
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,300
 broke bread with them. He set a table with

419
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,900
 them. And yet here's what you need to know.

420
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,100
 Every time he did, his motivation was not

421
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,700
 pleasure. It was purpose. He had a purpose in

422
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,800
 being around contaminating company. What's

423
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,300
 interesting is as you read Paul's letters, you

424
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,900
 realize he's actually not quite as concerned

425
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,700
 about your relationships with the defiled in

426
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,800
 the world. He's more concerned about your

427
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 relationships with the defiled in the church.

428
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 That's where he's more concerned. It says in

429
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,000
 1 Corinthians 5, "I wrote to you in my letter

430
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,200
 not to associate with the sexually immoral

431
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
 people." Catch this. Not at all meaning the

432
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,700
 people of this world who are immoral or greedy

433
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,700
 and swindlers, idolaters. In that case, you

434
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,900
 would have to leave this world. But now I'm

435
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,700
 writing to you that you must not associate

436
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,100
 with anyone who claims to be a brother or

437
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,300
 sister. That would be a believer that is

438
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,100
 sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or

439
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,400
 slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Don't even

440
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,900
 eat with such people. That feels like a strong

441
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,200
 statement. And yet it does not diminish the

442
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,500
 truth. So where in your life are you

443
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 rationalizing relationships with other

444
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,100
 Christians? Because, man, they're your friends,

445
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,400
 they're your community, they're your lifelong,

446
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,500
 your besties. And yet it is toxic to your soul.

447
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,900
 It could be that group of friends that, man,

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 they never go out and get drunk. That would

449
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
 ruin our witness. And yet they don't have a

450
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,600
 problem getting together in the safety of

451
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,700
 their home and having a few one too many. It

452
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,900
 could be that buddy of yours that, man, he

453
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,300
 loves to praise God and yet from the same

454
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,700
 mouth, he speaks profanity and makes vulgar

455
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,900
 jokes at the expense of other people. It could

456
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,000
 be that you have a group of friends that,

457
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
 man, they love to get together and they know,

458
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,600
 man, hey, the church is a unity of diversity

459
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 that we're not supposed to look all the same.

460
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
 And yet it would really mess up the social

461
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,100
 dynamic if we invited that person. You see,

462
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,900
 these are the types of relationships that we

463
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,100
 need to investigate because they contaminate.

464
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,300
 That's what Paul is telling you. You have to

465
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,600
 assess the who. Who is it that is potentially

466
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,300
 defiling you? If you want to get more of God,

467
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,300
 then you might have to give them up. We'll go

468
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,600
 quick. The what of your defilement is we need

469
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,400
 to consider what activity in our lives is

470
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,900
 making us unclean. You see, this does not just

471
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
 amount to sex, drugs, and drunkenness. It

472
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
 actually goes so much further. Like we need

473
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,200
 to consider what it is we consume. Like how

474
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,400
 good is it for your heart to watch the

475
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
 Secret Lives of Mormon Wives? How good is

476
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,400
 it for your soul to read A Court of Thorn

477
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,500
 and Roses every night before you go to sleep?

478
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 What's it doing to your spirit to listen to

479
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,000
 people like Tate McRae and Chapel Rowan?

480
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,200
 This may feel very extreme. Look at me. This

481
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,800
 might feel extreme. Consecration is extreme.

482
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,400
 If you're content settling for a life that is

483
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,000
 less than the one Christ has come to give

484
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,900
 you, have your way. And yet if you want more,

485
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,700
 if you want to seize the kind of life that is

486
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,700
 available to you, then all of these things are

487
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,500
 worthy of giving away. That's the what. The

488
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 third is the when. We need to know when we're

489
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,700
 defiling ourselves. And this one's really

490
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,900
 important because most of your sin, it works

491
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,900
 like clockwork. Like if you consider the things

492
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,700
 you do in your life that you regret at the end

493
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,700
 of the day, they typically pop up at very

494
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,200
 rhythmic times. It happens every evening after

495
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,100
 11 p.m. when you should already be asleep.

496
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,000
 It's every Saturday whenever you're at the

497
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,900
 pool with your friends. It occurs at the end

498
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,600
 of every month whenever reports are due and

499
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,500
 you're stressed out of your mind. It's happy

500
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,000
 hour on Mondays after a long work day.

501
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,900
 Romans 13 says, verses 13 through 14, "Let us

502
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,200
 walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies

503
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,600
 and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and

504
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,900
 sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.

505
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,800
 Put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no

506
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,200
 provision for the flesh to gratify its desires."

507
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,700
 You see, some of the best things we could

508
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,900
 do tonight is we could cleanse our calendars.

509
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,600
 We consider where is it that I'm being led

510
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,800
 astray in my defilement that I can actually

511
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,400
 take time back for. And then the last is the

512
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
 where, the where of your defilement. We need

513
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,900
 to take inventory of where we go that we always

514
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,700
 leave with more regret than when we arrived.

515
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,800
 Like is it the gym? Is it brunch every weekend

516
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,900
 with the girls, with the guys? Is it being

517
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,600
 over at your girlfriend's house with the lights

518
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
 down low and the door shut behind? Maybe it's

519
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,400
 every time you go home to see your family, you

520
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
 revert right back into the same patterns that

521
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,700
 you've worked so hard to get away from. Where

522
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,900
 are you so very frequently defiled? I don't

523
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,300
 know where it is, but here's what I would say,

524
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,200
 and this is strong, you should stop going. And

525
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,100
 as I say that, here's what I know, like excuses

526
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,300
 just start popping off. But Kylan, like a guy's

527
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,900
 got to work out. Or you think that I can't help

528
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,800
 the fact that work sends me on a trip. You know

529
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,700
 what? I don't want to do what I do in that hotel

530
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,400
 room, but it's my job, man. Or maybe you think

531
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,300
 like, no, no, no, like that interview league,

532
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,400
 like I have to be there. I'm the best on the team.

533
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,100
 If I'm not there, then they're never going to

534
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,500
 win. I don't know what it is. But rather than

535
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,400
 reaching for so many excuses, what if you reach

536
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,800
 for solutions instead? What if you actually

537
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,200
 considered what do I need to do so that way I

538
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,300
 do not do what I need to do? That makes sense?

539
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,800
 You've got to let go of that which is gripped

540
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,000
 so very, so very fast of you. The sin which so

541
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,400
 easily entangles you have to get rid of it so

542
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,900
 that we can get as much of God as possible. This

543
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,200
 is the way of consecration. God wants to use

544
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,500
 you as you should be, not just as you are. That's

545
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,100
 the first step. The second step is in verse 21

546
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,700
 as well. It says, "Therefore, if anyone cleanses

547
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,300
 himself from what is dishonorable, he will be

548
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,900
 a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy,

549
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,000
 useful to the master of the house, ready for

550
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,800
 every good work." So based on what Paul is

551
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,700
 saying here, this is really important. He's not

552
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,800
 just saying that there are honorable vessels.

553
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,000
 He's also saying there are honorable uses, which

554
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,700
 tells us something important. Consecration is

555
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,700
 uncomfortable, but it's always purposeful.

556
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,000
 Consecration is uncomfortable, but it is always

557
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 purposeful. According to Paul, the goal isn't

558
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,200
 just to become an honorable vessel, but to fulfill

559
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,800
 an honorable use. I don't know what that does

560
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 for you, but that exhilarates me. That gets me

561
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,700
 excited because I don't just want to be someone

562
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,100
 that is polished up. I want to be someone that

563
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,300
 is purposed for. I want to have a purpose in my

564
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,600
 life, driven to do something that is great,

565
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,200
 that's worthy, that makes an impact. Listen to

566
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,200
 me. God is the one that gives those things. There

567
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,500
 is no cause like the cause of Christ. There is

568
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,700
 no kingdom worth building than his kingdom

569
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,500
 itself. And so if you're looking for a purpose

570
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,400
 to live into, God has not just come to polish

571
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,900
 you. He has come to purpose you. And it's a

572
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,700
 purpose the likes of which you could not dare

573
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,700
 dream find anywhere else. So several years ago,

574
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,300
 I was visiting with a lady in our church. She

575
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,000
 was telling me about her son who was serving

576
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,100
 in the special forces. He had just come home,

577
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,700
 spent a little time with her, and he was

578
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,700
 returning back to active duty, into deployment.

579
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,300
 And she was telling me about everything he

580
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
 did. It included things the likes of which many

581
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,000
 men would wish were true in their own lives.

582
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
 He was jumping from planes, and he was shooting

583
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,800
 targets 2,000 yards off, and he was engaging in

584
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,600
 guerrilla warfare. He was learning how to

585
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,900
 stabilize disrupted regions. And as she was

586
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:17,500
 telling me all of this, I had to ask her, "Does

587
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,900
 that not make you afraid when you consider all

588
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,400
 the danger he faces?" And I'll never forget her

589
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,700
 response. She looked at me and said, "God made

590
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,300
 my son to be a warrior. And so somehow, because

591
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,200
 that is his purpose, he is safer on the front

592
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,100
 lines of some foreign fight than he would ever

593
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,800
 be sitting on my couch at home." She knew

594
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 something important. The safest place for you

595
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,700
 is within your purpose. That's what Paul is

596
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,800
 trying to tell us here. God's purpose is not

597
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,800
 just to cleanse you, but it's to use you.

598
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,100
 Now, he wants to use you, not just in the small

599
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,200
 ways you expect, but likely in the big ways

600
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,700
 you might forget. Like, I don't know about you,

601
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,000
 but more than likely, God wants to use your

602
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,500
 life by way of your hand to bring the least

603
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,300
 likely into saving faith. Like, he wants to

604
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,100
 empower your voice to be the one that speaks

605
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,800
 gospel identity and security into those family

606
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,200
 members that you have been praying for for so

607
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,500
 long. Don't you want God to use you to be the

608
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,900
 one to bring his manifest presence into your

609
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,200
 workspace or around your house or amongst your

610
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,400
 neighbors because you just pray ardently that

611
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,700
 he would show up? Don't you want God to lean

612
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,400
 into your life and give more power to you, not

613
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,700
 for your own glorification, not for your own

614
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,100
 reputation, but so that way he can get glory,

615
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,200
 they can get good, and you can get gladness.

616
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,000
 Don't you want that? Listen, that is what God

617
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,900
 wants. He wants to give you greatly, not for

618
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,200
 you in and of yourself, but for himself and

619
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,700
 for others as well. That's the heart of God.

620
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,600
 He wants to use you for a great purpose. You

621
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
 see, consecration is not just about purging

622
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
 yourself of impurity, it's about preparing

623
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,900
 yourself for destiny. So how do you do that?

624
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,600
 Well, Paul gives you a threefold way. He says

625
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,900
 you must set yourself apart as holy, you become

626
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,600
 useful to the master, and you are ready for

627
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,500
 every good work. You're set apart as holy. The

628
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,900
 word here in Greek is the same word used to

629
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,300
 be sanctified. The idea of sanctification is

630
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,300
 it's the lifelong process of becoming like

631
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,400
 Jesus. You see, consecration is not just about

632
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,200
 setting aside your sin and looking less like

633
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,900
 the world, it's about setting apart yourself

634
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,000
 and looking more like Christ. Do you see it?

635
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,200
 Consecration is the other side of repentance.

636
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,500
 They are one in the same, on the same coin,

637
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,800
 and yet repentance says, "Hey, turn away from

638
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,700
 these things," and consecration says, "Turn

639
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,700
 towards these things. Set yourself apart, move

640
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,000
 yourself towards greater holiness, become like

641
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,700
 Christ." I love the quote of C.S. Lewis on this

642
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,600
 idea. He says, "The more we let God take us over,

643
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,000
 the more truly ourselves we become, because he

644
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,300
 made us, he invented us, he invented all the

645
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,400
 different people that you and I were intended

646
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,200
 to be. It is when I turn to Christ, when I give

647
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,500
 up myself to his personality, that I first

648
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
 begin to have a real personality of my own."

649
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,300
 You see, whatever you set yourself apart to

650
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,700
 will determine what you become. So let me ask

651
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
 you, what are you setting yourself apart to?

652
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,200
 What are you setting yourself apart to? It's

653
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,800
 interesting. Consecration to God is so very hard

654
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,500
 for most of us, and yet we all consecrate

655
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,600
 ourselves to something every single day. Some

656
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,000
 of you have consecrated yourself so devotedly

657
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,700
 to your job, to the point that you're working

658
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,400
 70, 80, 90-hour weeks. Why? Because you want

659
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
 to become partner, because you want to make

660
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 seven figures a year, because you want to be

661
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,100
 on Forbes 30 Under 30. So many of you have

662
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,100
 consecrated yourself to perfection, to the

663
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,100
 point that you clear your inbox every single

664
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,400
 day, and we hate you for it. You mark off every

665
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
 single thing on your to-do list, unlike most

666
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,400
 of us. You type, and you retype, and you retype

667
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,000
 that caption again and again and again, because

668
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
 you can't get it perfect enough. Why do you

669
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,700
 do that? Because you do not want to become a

670
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,000
 failure. You want to become approvable. So many

671
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,400
 of us are consecrated with our bodies, to the

672
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,700
 point that you count up a calorie, you never

673
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,800
 miss a class, how dare you think about missing

674
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,300
 your anabolic window, you get some work done.

675
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,600
 Why? Because you have a vision of what you

676
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,900
 want to look like, who you physically want to

677
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,900
 become. You are consecrating yourself to

678
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,300
 something, and that something is determining

679
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:12,000
 what you are becoming. If you're setting yourself

680
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,900
 apart to anything other than Christ, you are

681
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,500
 settling for less. You are settling for less.

682
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,200
 The more of God you give, the more of God you

683
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,100
 get, and there's nothing like God. You become

684
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,800
 useful to the master of the house. That's the

685
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,700
 second thing he says. What does it mean to be

686
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,500
 useful? It does not mean just to be available.

687
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,700
 It means to be helpful. I am not useful to my

688
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,300
 wife if I'm standing in the kitchen waiting for

689
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,100
 her to call me over. I'm just a waste of space.

690
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,900
 I am helpful to my wife whenever I start scrubbing

691
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,200
 dishes and cooking dinner and putting away

692
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,700
 groceries. That's when I become useful. Listen

693
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,700
 to me. So many of us were available for the work

694
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,300
 of God, but we're not helpful to the work of

695
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,200
 God. We're actually fully present, hoping he

696
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,600
 calls, and we're missing the fact that he's

697
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,900
 already called. I love this, man. Adam, Adam and

698
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,700
 Eve, that brother was waiting for a suitable

699
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,300
 partner, and yet he didn't just sit around

700
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
 available to the work of God. He was helpful to

701
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,600
 it. He named every single animal in the animal

702
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,200
 kingdom. That guy was working. He was helpful

703
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,700
 to the things of God. And in due time, God gave

704
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,400
 that brother what he wanted and what so many of

705
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,600
 you want as well. Why don't you move towards

706
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,100
 being helpful? For in your helpfulness, God will

707
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,900
 use you to be useful also. Friends, listen to

708
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,000
 me. Here's how you can tell if you're being

709
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,300
 useful. If you left the church tomorrow, would

710
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,300
 we feel your absence? Would we actually know?

711
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,100
 I remember facing this question several years

712
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,500
 ago and realizing the answer was no. I wasn't

713
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,000
 serving. I wasn't plugged in. I wasn't leading

714
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,900
 in any kind of capacity. I was just attending.

715
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,900
 I was just consuming. And had I left that day,

716
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,600
 no one would have known the wiser. Friends, this

717
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:30,500
 is important. No Christian is better than another.

718
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,700
 But some Christians are more useful than others.

719
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,500
 Some are more useful. Why don't you be useful?

720
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,400
 Get involved. Serve someplace. Get your membership

721
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 in process. Join the church. Like choose to plug

722
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,300
 into what God is doing here. Start being helpful

723
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,400
 because that's what makes you useful for God.

724
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,100
 The third thing that he says is he says be ready

725
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,000
 for every work. The Greek here literally means

726
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,900
 to make ready. Not just that you're willing, but

727
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,700
 you're already made ready. Like the idea of this

728
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,400
 is what we studied about the Revolutionary War

729
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,500
 whenever we in grade school from the Minutemen.

730
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
 You remember those guys like that small group,

731
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,600
 the elite fighting force that they would pop up

732
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,700
 and spring in action at a moment's notice. That's

733
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,600
 what it means to be ready to work. It's to be a

734
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,300
 Minuteman to the glory of God and the good of

735
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,200
 Christ. Like that's what you're called to do.

736
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,800
 And every time this word for make ready or to

737
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,100
 prepare is using the scripture, it's always used

738
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,900
 or frequently used in advance of something big.

739
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,500
 Like just to give you a rundown. Like prepare

740
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,200
 the way of the Lord. Prepare the Passover meal.

741
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,000
 Jesus' burial was prepared. He was prepared before

742
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,300
 his burial. You prepared a place for the Ark of

743
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,500
 the Covenant to reside. The left and right hand

744
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,600
 seats beside Jesus in glory must be prepared by

745
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,700
 the Father. New Jerusalem was prepared. The city

746
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,800
 of God by God himself. The promised land was

747
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,300
 one which was prepared for the people to inherit.

748
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,300
 The bride of Christ is prepared, adorned for her

749
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,100
 husband. God prepares all throughout the scripture

750
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,800
 for really great things and he is prepared for

751
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
 you as well. Ephesians 2 10 says, "For we are

752
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,700
 his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good

753
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,600
 works, which God," what? "prepared beforehand that

754
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,800
 you should walk in them." God has already prepared.

755
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,000
 The question is, are you preparing yourself?

756
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Like do you have to be coaxed or urged or persuaded

757
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,800
 into action? Or are you ready for it? Like when

758
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,600
 you sit down with your boss and they talk start

759
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,200
 talking spiritual things, are you ready to share

760
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,000
 the gospel with them? Oh, no, Colin. That would

761
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,700
 be too much. Listen, that's what consecration

762
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,300
 looks like. It's saying I'm willing not just to

763
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,800
 do what's acceptable. I'm willing to do whatever

764
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
 it takes to give God a glory and lean into his

765
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,700
 purposes for my life. It is there where I feel

766
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,500
 totally out of control that I might actually see

767
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 God moving away the likes of which I normally

768
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,000
 do not. Some of you, you need to consider if,

769
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,700
 man, am I ready to give up that paycheck to pay

770
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,000
 someone's rent because they can't make it this

771
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 month? I don't know what it is. Consider the

772
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,900
 craziest thing in your mind. And the question

773
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
 is, are you prepared to do that? Are you prepared

774
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,100
 to do it? Because God wants to make you ready

775
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:32,800
 for every good work. Our third and final step.

776
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,100
 It's in verse 22. We'll go quick. He says, "So

777
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,800
 flee youthful passions, pursue righteousness,

778
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,300
 faith, love, and peace, along with those who

779
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,000
 call on the Lord from a pure heart." Paul reiterates

780
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,400
 here what he's been saying this entire time. He

781
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,000
 says, "Hey, there are some things that you need

782
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,700
 to set aside in your sin. There is some ways that

783
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,300
 you need to set yourself apart to God." And here

784
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,800
 in this moment, he tells you the heart behind

785
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,000
 it all. It's because you just want more of God.

786
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,200
 That's it. That's the heart that he's communicating

787
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,900
 here. You do all of these things. You do what

788
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,200
 feels so extreme, so even unnecessary, because

789
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,300
 you just want more of God. And listen to me.

790
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:20,300
 That is what God wants to. God is looking for

791
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:25,500
 a people that are looking for him. God is looking

792
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,100
 for a people that are looking for him. Are you

793
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,100
 looking for him? Yeah, man. I show up at church

794
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,800
 on Sunday. Yeah, man. I come to a group once a

795
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,300
 week. Go around, confess my sin. Yeah, man. I

796
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,100
 pay my monthly Christian membership fees. I

797
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,900
 make sure I get my quiet time in at least a

798
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,500
 couple times a week. That's not looking for him.

799
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,000
 Looking for God is one that's not trying to

800
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,300
 balance spiritual burnout, but is willing to

801
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,200
 burn for God instead. Willing to lean all the

802
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,800
 way forward into what he wants to give you,

803
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
 which is life, the likes of which you will find

804
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,700
 nowhere else. What's the cost? Everything. It

805
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,500
 costs you everything. You take up your cross,

806
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,800
 you die to yourself, and yet what do you find

807
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,300
 in return? Everything. You find Jesus, the one

808
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,500
 who leads you not just into life today, but

809
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,000
 life forever. He gives you what no one else can.

810
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,700
 And not only does he give you everything that

811
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,400
 you want, he is incomparable next to any other

812
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,500
 alternative. He is matchless in his beauty. He

813
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,500
 is transcendent beyond comprehension. There's

814
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,600
 no one like him. And so yes, we can say you're

815
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,800
 everything, Jesus, but your heart, if you were

816
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,900
 to see him more clearly, would say, I want you

817
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:49,500
 to be everything too. Are you looking for him?

818
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,800
 You see, consecration is a work that begins at

819
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
 an individual level, but imagine what God would

820
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,000
 do if hundreds of us were filled with this

821
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,600
 holy ambition to uncommonly devote ourselves

822
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,200
 to him. What would he do? What do you think

823
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,100
 God would do? I genuinely believe he would move

824
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,800
 in this room in ways we've never seen. He would

825
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,200
 move in our city in ways we've never seen. He

826
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,500
 would move in our generation in ways we've

827
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,400
 never seen. Not so people look back and say,

828
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,700
 man, it started in Dallas. No, so people know

829
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,700
 it started with him. That would be the result.

830
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,500
 God gives more of himself wherever we give

831
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,200
 more of ourselves. And the reason we know that

832
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,100
 that nothing should be off limits, that nothing

833
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,900
 is out of bounds, that nothing is ever too much

834
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,900
 is because Jesus looked at you and said, nothing

835
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,200
 is off limits. Nothing is too much. Nothing is

836
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,600
 out of bounds. I will go as far as I can to get

837
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,800
 to them. You know, when I started building that

838
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,500
 patio cover, all the thoughts of what would be

839
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,100
 hosting friends over and watching football and

840
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,400
 pushing my son in his swing, all of those things

841
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,900
 were deeply motivating for me. They were a good

842
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,200
 reason to absorb the considerable cost in order

843
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,700
 to pursue a considerable purpose. But those things

844
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,100
 are not the only reason why I still do it today.

845
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,000
 In fact, they might not be the biggest reason

846
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,600
 why I do it today. No, the biggest reason why I

847
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,300
 continue to pour myself out at great cost to

848
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,500
 myself to build the structure is because my dad

849
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,900
 is helping me build it. You see, when my father

850
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,300
 caught wind of what I was doing, how much it was

851
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,500
 costing, how hard I was working, he jumped into

852
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,800
 it with me. Yes, I was giving so much, but by the

853
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,100
 way, the time we get together, I have gotten far

854
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:55,600
 more in return. That's the promise of consecration.

855
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,300
 That as you pour out, God pours in. He pours in

856
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,300
 in a way that exceeds whatever it is you give.

857
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,300
 He wants to give more of himself to you. And the

858
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,300
 reason we know that is because he gave everything

859
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:15,600
 for you. We know when there was no one capable

860
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,100
 of living the perfect life, Jesus wanted to live

861
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,500
 the perfect life in your place. He did everything

862
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,700
 that you could not, so that he could have everything

863
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,300
 he wants to give. But not just that, he endured

864
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,800
 all of the discomfort of your sin because he was

865
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,600
 driven by a purpose the likes of which heaven

866
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,500
 rejoices in. One where sinners come home, the lost

867
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:48,000
 are found, the dead are saved. And when none of

868
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,600
 us were looking for him, he came looking for you.

869
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,700
 Looking for you, not just in life, not just in

870
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,700
 death, but looking for you in resurrection that

871
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,400
 he might give the resurrected life to any that

872
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,700
 would place their faith in him. When we were not

873
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,400
 pursuing him, he was pursuing you. When we were

874
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,800
 not willing to sacrifice for his sake, he was

875
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,200
 willing to sacrifice for yours. When we were not

876
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,100
 willing to devote all of our lives, he was willing

877
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,800
 to devote all of his love. Why? So that he might

878
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,400
 have you forever. Porch, let me ask you, do you

879
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,000
 want to be consecrated? You give more of God if

880
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,800
 you do. Is it uncomfortable? For sure. Is it

881
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,500
 worthwhile? Absolutely. Let me pray for you. God,

882
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,500
 thanks for tonight. Thanks for my friends here

883
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,100
 and their patience just as we work through this

884
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:48,400
 this evening. God, I know this topic is hard and

885
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,500
 it's heavy. I felt that God, even as I was prepping

886
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,200
 it, it's one that it can feel like, man, you're

887
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,000
 asking a lot of me, but really God, what we need

888
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,700
 believe is you are offering so much to us instead.

889
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,900
 The exchange right here is crazy. It's one where

890
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,200
 we give up not just the bad, but also some good.

891
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,300
 Why? So we can get God. And so Lord, I pray you

892
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,800
 would help us to understand you are not asking

893
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,300
 too much. Instead, you're giving too much. You're

894
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,400
 giving too much to an unworthy people. You're

895
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,400
 giving yourself for you have already given

896
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,900
 yourself in your son. I pray Lord, if there are

897
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
 any here that do not know you, they might know

898
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,500
 you tonight. They might see you, Jesus, place

899
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,300
 their faith in you as Lord and follow you forever.

900
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,800
 It's that easy. And for others, God, I pray, work

901
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,200
 your now Holy Spirit. Do the work of illumination,

902
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,200
 bring things to mind, the work of conviction,

903
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,900
 prick our hearts, but ultimately the work of

904
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,900
 transformation where you lead us not just to be

905
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,500
 better, but to be more like you. We love you.

906
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,300
 It's in your name we pray. Amen.
