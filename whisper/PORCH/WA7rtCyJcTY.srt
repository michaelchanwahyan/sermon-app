1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 Oh, how you guys doing?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,440
 Good?

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,640
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,340
 I am excited to be here.

5
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,780
 Man, that was powerful and amazing.

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,140
 For those that don't know, me and my family,

7
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,180
 we live in Maui, Hawaii, which is awesome,

8
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,320
 and we love it, and it's incredible.

9
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
 Shout out, someone came from there?

10
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,220
 Okay.

11
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,320
 I think there's someone from every state

12
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,400
 except Vermont, come on, Vermont.

13
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,220
 Who's the Hawaii person?

14
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,360
 We got some Hawaii people?

15
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,200
 Hawaii people?

16
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,040
 You're not here, you wanna be quiet?

17
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,760
 Okay, thank you, I love you.

18
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,000
 Trying to represent, got owned right there.

19
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,480
 Very excited to be here, but what I was gonna say

20
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,880
 is how incredible this is to see something like this

21
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,220
 and how powerful it is, because man,

22
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,280
 in Maui, it's a little bit of like a small town,

23
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,640
 small island, and so I think our mega church,

24
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,600
 and I mean like the one that does the VBS,

25
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,040
 the one that does the events,

26
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,220
 the one that does the conferences,

27
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,080
 I think is probably like this big right here,

28
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,560
 this section, so appreciate you guys, by the way.

29
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,320
 So it's just incredible to be in a room

30
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,640
 with this thousands of young people

31
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,720
 worshiping, loving the Lord, opening up the scriptures.

32
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,560
 It's really amazing.

33
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,960
 So if you have your Bible, Genesis 2,

34
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,940
 Genesis 2, if you were here on the porch on Tuesday,

35
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,100
 yes, I was in Genesis 1, so maybe in the next 900 years

36
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,220
 while I visit, we can maybe get through

37
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,180
 the whole Bible together.

38
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,660
 And the same problem is happening,

39
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,060
 whereas I told you my two-year-old

40
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,780
 ripped my Genesis 1 and 2, so hopefully I can read it okay.

41
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,820
 Like I said, hopefully, I don't know why

42
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,720
 she hates the scriptures, but anyways.

43
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,260
 I'm excited to be with you guys.

44
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,380
 Now, I have a very big task today, self-imposed, I guess,

45
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,300
 but I want to basically summarize the entire scriptures

46
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
 for you in the next 30 minutes.

47
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,060
 Can we do that, can we buckle up and get ready?

48
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,820
 So here's the reason.

49
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,300
 I believe that so many of us,

50
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,260
 specifically in the Western Evangelical Church,

51
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,220
 we're very good at memorizing verses,

52
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,780
 we're very good at tattooing them on our wrists.

53
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,900
 Anyone else got the cliche Greek?

54
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,980
 Okay, me too.

55
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,460
 We're very good at the micro,

56
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,540
 we're not very good at the macro.

57
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,900
 There's something about the, like I would say,

58
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,500
 another way to put it is we're malnourished,

59
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,700
 we have a missing nutrient, and that's the story of God.

60
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,180
 Beginning to end, God is doing something,

61
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,780
 and there's something powerful about that

62
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,420
 when you understand the metanarrative,

63
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,380
 which is a big theological term for it.

64
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,220
 When you understand that,

65
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,260
 I think it does something deeply to you and your walk

66
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,100
 and how you live in your city, how you treat money,

67
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,340
 how you're in relationships.

68
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,220
 There's something about the big story of God

69
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,740
 that is deeply compelling,

70
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,940
 and we can find ourselves in it,

71
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,020
 but we have to understand it.

72
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,980
 So I'm gonna try to just blaze through that,

73
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,460
 try to trace some big benchmarks, and we'll go from there.

74
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,980
 Now, I'm gonna do this with one question, okay?

75
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,500
 I'm gonna try to trace this big story

76
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,420
 with one question or one premise,

77
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,220
 and that is what does God want from us?

78
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,260
 What does God want from us?

79
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,620
 Or another way to put it is what is God after?

80
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,500
 I think there's multiple answers to that question,

81
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
 by the way.

82
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,340
 I don't think I'm just gonna give you one answer

83
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,820
 that's the say-all, be-all,

84
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,300
 but I do think I wanna talk about one of them,

85
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,340
 and I think what God is after is a word

86
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,220
 that I'm just gonna say one word, and that is intimacy.

87
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,140
 So if you're taking notes, write down intimacy.

88
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,500
 I think God is a God who is in pursuit of us

89
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,620
 in the garden mandate he gave us in Genesis

90
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,260
 to know us and be known by us, okay?

91
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,180
 He doesn't need us, but he wants us.

92
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,220
 I know it's a weird way to think about it,

93
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,500
 but God has wants and desires.

94
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,460
 He has a person, is he not?

95
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,220
 There's three persons in the Trinity.

96
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,660
 And so he has wants and his desires,

97
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,180
 and so I think we do have to ask ourselves,

98
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,180
 according to the scriptures like David talked about,

99
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,780
 this is our beacon, this is our north star.

100
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,300
 What does God want from us?

101
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,580
 What is that story?

102
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,020
 Because let me just say, too, by the way,

103
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,980
 if you're not saturated and entrenched

104
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,020
 in the story of God, you will be captured by another story.

105
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,300
 You will be captured by another story

106
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
 because here's another way to put it.

107
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,820
 We are story creatures,

108
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,180
 meaning a story has to live inside of us.

109
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,460
 It's impossible to be a human without a story.

110
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,580
 It's impossible, and when I say that,

111
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,140
 I mean just again, the meta-narrative,

112
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,340
 another term for it is the telos,

113
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,140
 this vision, this aim of our life.

114
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,060
 What are we going after?

115
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,020
 Why are we here?

116
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,860
 What's the point?

117
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,700
 All these big questions,

118
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,860
 even if we're not explicitly answering them,

119
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,820
 there's almost like a ticking clock inside of us

120
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,780
 pushing us towards our telos that we think is correct.

121
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,820
 Now, all of them are wrong,

122
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,020
 except if we align with what it means to be human

123
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,300
 as an image bearer of God in pursuit of him,

124
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,100
 being known by him, and knowing him.

125
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,780
 So if you don't know that story,

126
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,020
 then you are captured by something else right now.

127
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,340
 We're all captured by a story, let it be the right one,

128
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,540
 because all the other stories lead to destruction

129
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,220
 and death and decay and erosion in our hearts

130
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,220
 and our relationships in our city.

131
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,140
 So if you have Genesis 2,

132
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,260
 we're gonna try to answer that question,

133
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,500
 if you have it open.

134
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,340
 What does God want from us?

135
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,180
 Let's go down to verse 15.

136
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,780
 "The Lord God took the man

137
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,020
 "and he put him in the Garden of Eden

138
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,580
 "to work it and to keep it."

139
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,540
 Oh, how'd you guys do that so fast?

140
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,740
 I didn't even tell you I was gonna read this text.

141
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,060
 You guys are amazing, okay.

142
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,900
 (congregation laughing)

143
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,540
 Watermark production is like ninjas, are they not?

144
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,380
 Like, it's like, guys, like, how'd you do that?

145
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,900
 Okay, and it's all fancy, oh man.

146
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,820
 "And the Lord," okay, where was I?

147
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,380
 Verse 16, okay, like I said,

148
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,060
 we don't see this where I'm from, okay.

149
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,060
 "The Lord God commanded the man,

150
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,080
 "saying, 'You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,

151
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,180
 "'but of the tree of the knowledge and good and evil

152
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,020
 "'you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat it,

153
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,500
 "'you shall surely die.'"

154
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,220
 Okay, God creates these image bearers,

155
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,060
 these royal priests, these divine representatives of Him

156
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
 to reign and rule with Him, by the way.

157
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,380
 What an amazing picture, by the way,

158
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,820
 what it means to be human.

159
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,980
 You're called to reign and rule alongside

160
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,540
 the creator of the universe, and He has said that so.

161
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,740
 Anything lesser than that is too small.

162
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,620
 Anything lesser than that is too small.

163
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,740
 Reign and rule alongside with your creator.

164
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,300
 That's the call, that's the command.

165
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,140
 And while He sets them in to do this job,

166
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,340
 He kind of gives them a couple little rules,

167
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,660
 a couple little pointers.

168
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,140
 And He says, "Everything in this garden is yours,"

169
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,100
 which by the way, it takes a little Hebrew to unpack this,

170
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,180
 but when it says, "You may surely eat

171
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,340
 "of everything in the garden,"

172
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,980
 that word eat in Hebrew is like redundant.

173
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,060
 It's actually almost saying it twice.

174
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,300
 It's like saying, "You shall eat, eat, eat, eat."

175
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,740
 Like basically He's just saying, "Everything is yours."

176
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,080
 But when He says, "You should not touch the tree

177
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,300
 "of the knowledge of good and evil," that's singular.

178
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,620
 By the way, do we not reverse that

179
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,420
 in our vision of God a lot of times?

180
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,980
 God's always saying, "No, no, no, no, no,

181
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
 "maybe a little, yes."

182
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,140
 Do you have the right picture of God

183
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,900
 informed by the scriptures?

184
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,880
 Because according to this God,

185
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,060
 He is saying, "It's all yours."

186
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,180
 You can even go in Luke 15

187
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,980
 when the father is trying to play the picture of God as well

188
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,540
 and he says, "Everything that is mine is," what?

189
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,840
 "Yours."

190
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,900
 Do you have a stingy, crappy view of God?

191
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,820
 Can I say crappy in Dallas?

192
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,660
 Too late, okay.

193
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,700
 (congregation laughing)

194
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,100
 Trying to, you know, cultural context.

195
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,660
 Okay, do you have a stingy, terrible, small view of God

196
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,900
 or do you have a God who is lavish,

197
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,260
 who wants you to eat, who wants you to delight,

198
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,860
 who wants you to celebrate with restrictions, by the way?

199
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,740
 I'm not saying those aren't in there.

200
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,740
 It's obviously there, like we just read.

201
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,580
 Within His boundaries, within His markers,

202
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,740
 within how He's lined it up to work,

203
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,740
 He wants you to delight and celebrate

204
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,080
 and be blessed in His goodness.

205
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,260
 That's why it's so amazing to follow Jesus

206
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,760
 because He actually wants to fill us with the most joy

207
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,020
 and it's only possible through Him.

208
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
 But let's look at that command.

209
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,360
 "You may surely eat of every tree of the Garden of Eden,

210
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,820
 "but you may surely not eat of the tree

211
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,420
 "of the knowledge of good and evil."

212
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,500
 Okay, now back up.

213
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,260
 So they were just given a very big job to do, right?

214
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,180
 Go create and subdue and reign and rule with God.

215
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,100
 One little pro tip here is a lot of us,

216
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,940
 we think we read Genesis and we think the whole earth

217
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,980
 was just like perfect and beautiful and amazing.

218
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,420
 That's not really what the story is trying to say.

219
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,740
 The story is almost like a prototype was created.

220
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,260
 God created this little pocket called the Garden of Eden.

221
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,540
 He created order out of chaos.

222
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,360
 He created beauty.

223
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,260
 He created goodness.

224
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,460
 He puts the image bearers in it and then He says,

225
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,660
 "Look around.

226
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,740
 "Now go make the rest of the world look like this."

227
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,000
 Are you tracking?

228
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,860
 That was the job.

229
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,640
 The job was, hey, here's a prototype.

230
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,540
 Pay attention.

231
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,780
 Now go make everything else look like this.

232
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,860
 We're still doing that job today, are we not?

233
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,920
 Again, to go subdue, to reign and rule.

234
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,140
 So He gives them that job.

235
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,820
 Now, can we disagree that's a semi-big job?

236
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,040
 Go make the rest of the world look like Eden?

237
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
 So I don't know about you,

238
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,460
 but this command seems a little strange to me

239
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,740
 because when I read that,

240
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,860
 what's one thing you would probably need

241
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,420
 to go do a job that massive?

242
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,400
 What?

243
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
 It's not a trick question.

244
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,060
 We just read it.

245
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,020
 You'd probably need the knowledge of good and evil, right?

246
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,340
 Or another way to put it is you just probably need

247
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,980
 to know what's right and wrong.

248
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,660
 You need to know how to operate.

249
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,100
 But I remember growing up too in some church context,

250
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,420
 and I always heard this command,

251
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,620
 and I always thought it was like

252
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,820
 an eternal cat and mouse game.

253
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,840
 Anyone else?

254
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,760
 Or is God just kind of trying to bait and switch them?

255
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,300
 Is this kind of like, another way to put it is,

256
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,340
 don't ever play God, by the way.

257
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,820
 It never ends well in your brain.

258
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,940
 But when I was like, well, if I was God, right?

259
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
 This is me as like eight years old or something.

260
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,900
 I was like, well, if He didn't want Him to touch the tree,

261
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,060
 then what's the obvious solution?

262
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,380
 Don't put it there.

263
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,500
 Don't put it there.

264
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,940
 Why is it there, right?

265
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,380
 Unless, unless it's not arbitrary,

266
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,460
 it's actually for a reason.

267
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,860
 Might it be that that command

268
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,260
 from the very first page of Scripture

269
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,780
 is God inviting us into intimacy, right?

270
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,660
 See, if they don't eat of that tree,

271
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,480
 if they don't eat of it,

272
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,700
 it's not a trick question, by the way,

273
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,260
 what do they not have in and of themselves?

274
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,140
 The knowledge of good and evil.

275
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,780
 Okay, so now if you're the humans

276
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,980
 tasked with this massive job,

277
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
 you don't in and of yourselves

278
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,900
 have the knowledge of good and evil,

279
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,860
 where are you going to find it?

280
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,680
 God, right?

281
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,980
 Anytime you're in a church setting, you ask the question,

282
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,940
 just say God or Jesus, you'll be right.

283
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,380
 And if you're not, then like you say,

284
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,380
 well, I'm more holy, I said Jesus, okay?

285
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,180
 It's actually, it's not arbitrary.

286
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,500
 This command from page one is not arbitrary.

287
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,020
 It's God setting this tone or these two paths

288
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,940
 and inviting us to intimacy.

289
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,820
 It's God from page one saying, I want to walk with you

290
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,540
 and I want you to lean so heavily on me

291
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,500
 in faith and trust and dependence

292
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,900
 that you come to me for what is right and wrong,

293
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,780
 that I infuse in our deepest part of our relationship

294
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,420
 an actual spirit in you that informs you

295
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,300
 about what decisions you should make,

296
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,860
 how you should go about doing this

297
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,620
 and how you can do the job.

298
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,660
 So it's an invitation or it's a fork in the road

299
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,900
 from page one saying, you can follow God,

300
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,100
 how you were created to operate and work

301
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,180
 and live under his design, or you can do it yourself,

302
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,860
 it never ends well.

303
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,540
 You can be the king of your own life.

304
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,260
 You can say, you know how sex works better.

305
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,820
 You can say, you know how money works better.

306
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,580
 You can say, you know how relationships work better.

307
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,940
 It does not end well.

308
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,100
 Spoiler alert, Genesis three,

309
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,820
 we'll get there in a second, okay?

310
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,740
 It does not end well, but it's a call to intimacy

311
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,580
 from page one.

312
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,820
 So I want us to start there and then we'll keep going, okay?

313
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,660
 So he invites them into this,

314
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,580
 this vision of I want you to be co-creators

315
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,900
 and collaborators and laborers with me as your king

316
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,580
 underneath me, commissioned out to be image bearers,

317
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,940
 but don't touch this tree

318
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,780
 because I want it to be in relationship with you.

319
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,940
 I don't want you to be able to do it without me.

320
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,340
 But spoiler alert, did they eat or not eat?

321
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,180
 They ate.

322
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,740
 They ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

323
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,580
 And again, so many of us,

324
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,260
 that's the path maybe we're on right now.

325
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,900
 I know better.

326
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,300
 And some of us, we need a season to totally play that out.

327
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,380
 Do we not?

328
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,540
 Some of us, we don't want to pay attention

329
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,940
 until that just ends in the dumps,

330
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,780
 till that just ends in a place of us feeling so eroded,

331
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,460
 so corroded in our souls, so at a place of,

332
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,460
 man, this does not end well.

333
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,780
 But by the way, Jesus is there to meet you, is he not?

334
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,260
 Every time, every time.

335
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,820
 And so there's this invitation, they eat the tree,

336
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,700
 and then in a second, everything fractures.

337
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,820
 Their humanness, the world,

338
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,140
 their relationship with God, everything breaks.

339
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,540
 Sin is like a disease that comes in

340
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,500
 and breaks and fractures every part,

341
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
 our relationship with God, our relationship to the earth,

342
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,140
 and our relationship to ourselves,

343
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,540
 and our relationship to each other.

344
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,100
 It breaks everything.

345
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,140
 Now, this is a fun little trivia for you.

346
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,460
 It says immediately after that,

347
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,340
 God kind of puts some curses and says some things

348
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,060
 and talks, you know, it gets a little serious.

349
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,900
 And then he kicks them out

350
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,420
 a particular direction in the garden.

351
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,660
 Do you know what direction that is?

352
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,220
 It's not a true question, there's only four options, right?

353
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,380
 Northwest, south, and east.

354
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,300
 Yes, anyone?

355
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,740
 It's a famous Steinbeck novel, I haven't read it,

356
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,580
 I went to public school, but I heard it's good.

357
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,700
 What is it, east, there we go, east of Eden.

358
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,980
 It says he kicks them out east.

359
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
 Now, why is this important?

360
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,900
 Because that's actually a breadcrumb

361
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,220
 that keeps going in the scriptures

362
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,180
 farther and farther down the road.

363
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,300
 The next chapter, Lot, I mean, sorry,

364
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,500
 Cain kills his brother Abel,

365
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,340
 what direction does it say he kicked him out,

366
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,020
 or I mean banished him?

367
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,780
 East, Lot departs from Abraham

368
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,020
 the minute they have a little bit of tension,

369
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,660
 and it's clearly he's the choice of disobedience

370
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,580
 in that story, what direction does he go?

371
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,780
 East, you get to Genesis 11,

372
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,180
 the peak story of all human pride and rebellion.

373
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,020
 We can, it's like the collective version of Genesis 3.

374
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,940
 We can do it on our own, we can build a tower to heaven,

375
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,300
 we can do it ourselves, and it says they migrated where?

376
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,460
 The east, it says if east,

377
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,660
 according to the writer of Genesis,

378
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,300
 is almost this metaphor of this picture

379
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,700
 of what it looks to spiral downwards

380
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,100
 and away from intimacy with your creator,

381
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,900
 from the garden, from walking with him,

382
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,220
 from being with him.

383
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,340
 East, if we continue to make those choices,

384
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,500
 it just gets worse and worse and worse,

385
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 and we keep going the same direction.

386
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,620
 Now, right after Tower of Babel,

387
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,180
 we meet a fun figure named who?

388
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,940
 Abram, and then Abraham,

389
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,380
 he takes up a lot more of the Bible,

390
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,500
 but he's one of these first figures

391
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,060
 where he gets called by God,

392
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,300
 and he says yes to the relationship.

393
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
 He says yes to his way of how it's going to line up,

394
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,740
 and he trusts him, he has faith and dependency,

395
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,140
 which again is the heart of intimacy,

396
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,900
 and by the way, when it says he calls Abraham,

397
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,660
 what direction does Abraham go?

398
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,900
 West, he's going back towards the garden,

399
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,420
 the place that God wanted to walk with his people,

400
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,980
 and I nerd out on this stuff, so there's a lot more,

401
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,060
 but I'll give you one or two more.

402
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,500
 I think later down in the Torah,

403
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,020
 when God is giving Moses instructions

404
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,380
 to how to build the tabernacle,

405
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,700
 which by the way, the tabernacle is,

406
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,420
 he specifically gives him instructions to say,

407
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,860
 put a bunch of fruit in there,

408
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,100
 put a bunch of statues of animals,

409
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,460
 put a bunch of trees and foliage,

410
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,060
 what is he trying to represent the tabernacle as?

411
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,540
 The Garden of Eden, right?

412
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,380
 And he says specifically, put the entrance to the temple

413
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,540
 on the east side of the temple,

414
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,020
 so when you're walking in, you're going what direction?

415
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,980
 West, back towards meeting with God.

416
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,380
 It's as if God, from the very page of Scripture,

417
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,740
 all the way down even through the curse,

418
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,460
 is saying, I want to call you back.

419
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,740
 Stop going east.

420
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,540
 Stop thinking you can do it on your own.

421
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,060
 He wants to call us back,

422
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,980
 and he's continually calling us back.

423
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,660
 And so this first stage of the Bible

424
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
 is kind of what we talked about,

425
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,620
 and it goes all the way to the end

426
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,740
 of the first five books of the Bible,

427
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
 which is what we call the Torah.

428
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,060
 Can you guys say Torah?

429
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
 Torah.

430
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,820
 Or if you're really saying it Hebrew,

431
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,740
 you can kind of say it with a loogie,

432
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,140
 just don't spit on the person in front of you.

433
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,940
 Torah, you know, cough on someone,

434
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,140
 and especially now, that's dangerous.

435
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,980
 Okay.

436
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,540
 Woo, nevermind, don't do that.

437
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,260
 The first five books of the Bible

438
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,300
 are kind of seen as this foundational,

439
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,540
 these pillars, documents to the people of Israel,

440
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,300
 to the community, both for ethics and government

441
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,860
 and politics, but also the way to live and sexuality.

442
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,420
 It was kind of this full encompassing,

443
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,580
 this is how to live, this is how to be human,

444
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,940
 for the early ancient Near East people of Israel, okay?

445
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,300
 And the nation of God that God called them in that,

446
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,180
 in the promise of Abraham.

447
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,060
 Now, the Torah kind of has its own little thesis, right?

448
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,740
 What starts to show up later in the books

449
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,660
 is this common way that God begins to relate to his people

450
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,940
 in a particular covenant.

451
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,180
 It's the Mosaic Covenant, right?

452
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,580
 And God, hundreds of times in the Torah, by the way,

453
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,580
 says this thing where he basically goes,

454
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,380
 this is essentially me summarizing the Mosaic Covenant.

455
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,820
 If you do X, I will what?

456
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,140
 Starts with a B.

457
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,980
 Bless you.

458
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,220
 And if you don't do X, I will do what?

459
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,500
 Starts with a C.

460
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,420
 Curse you.

461
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,260
 And so hundreds of times, this formula

462
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,380
 almost starts to play out in Torah,

463
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,620
 where God is saying, if you live this way,

464
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
 if you do what I've asked you, if you live in this way,

465
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
 if you treat sexuality this way, money this way, et cetera,

466
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,140
 I will bless you, it'll go well for you.

467
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,500
 By the way, that's a fun phrase I'm saying

468
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,800
 to my kids 100 times a day.

469
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,660
 If you do this, it'll go well for you.

470
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,900
 Please do not do this, okay?

471
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,700
 And if you don't, I will curse you.

472
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,020
 Now, a curse, again, we think of that

473
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,620
 as something really serious.

474
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,500
 It's really serious, but you will live

475
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,260
 with the ramifications of that decision.

476
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,560
 It will erode itself, right?

477
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,980
 It will not go well for you.

478
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,140
 Now, we hear the Mosaic Covenant, and a lot of us,

479
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,500
 especially if we're in kind of a Western

480
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,580
 evangelical context, a lot of us cringe, right?

481
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,940
 'Cause that sounds just like super law, right?

482
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,780
 We're like, oh, that just sounds like no grace,

483
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,620
 it sounds like you gotta earn your way to heaven, et cetera.

484
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,300
 No, we are certainly outside of that covenant,

485
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,020
 and I'm gonna get to that in a minute,

486
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,820
 but can we disagree?

487
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,140
 God would never give something to his people

488
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,500
 that was not for their good, right?

489
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
 So what's going on there?

490
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,060
 I think a lot of us, we fumble with the law.

491
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,500
 We don't know exactly what's going on.

492
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,900
 What I would say is this, is it's actually not God

493
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,940
 arbitrarily not doing grace, but it's actually a way

494
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,820
 in which he's trying to relate to his people

495
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,700
 to lead them to intimacy, okay?

496
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,380
 Now, I know that's hard to think about.

497
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,620
 An illustration I think about is,

498
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,420
 all of us were raised on Torah obedience,

499
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,200
 were we not, early on?

500
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,040
 Early on?

501
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,620
 Like, so I have a couple children.

502
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,780
 I think they're even here, or they were here earlier.

503
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,700
 You never know, they probably cried,

504
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,180
 and they gotta bounce, they only last for five minutes.

505
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,660
 But our youngest right now, like, right?

506
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,060
 So the earliest times I can remember myself,

507
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,140
 or also even administering kind of Torah obedience,

508
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,060
 like, hey, if you go well, I'll bless you.

509
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,180
 You get a Skittle, you get a Snickers,

510
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,820
 you get a little candy, you get a cookie, whatever,

511
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,300
 and if you don't, I'll curse you, you don't get that.

512
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,260
 Right, that's essentially what it is.

513
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,500
 The earliest time I can remember that is, you know,

514
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
 like, right now we're doing it.

515
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
 It's like potty training, coming when we say come,

516
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,340
 and, you know, listening when we say no.

517
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,740
 Now, that is actually meant to, that's normal and fine,

518
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,620
 meaning like that's actually normal at that age,

519
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,980
 but where it becomes weird is if Torah obedience

520
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,740
 is the point the whole time.

521
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,580
 Track with me here.

522
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,740
 So let's say Lucy, our two-year-old,

523
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,820
 that's fine and normal now to say,

524
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,660
 hey, if you go to the bathroom,

525
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,540
 or if you go potty, you get a Skittle.

526
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,700
 Here you go, right?

527
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,300
 That's normal, and maybe if you're not a parent,

528
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,140
 you're like, that's still weird, okay.

529
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,180
 But let's say she's like, I don't know, 16 or something,

530
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,300
 and coming home from a weekend,

531
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,140
 or something with friends, or something like that,

532
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
 and we go, hey, little Lucy, if you go potty,

533
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,300
 I'll give you a Skittle.

534
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,340
 (congregation laughing)

535
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,900
 You'd be like, that's weird, that's weird.

536
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,460
 Now, did anything change that I said to her at two

537
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,740
 that I did at 16?

538
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,740
 No, that's the problem, that's the problem, right?

539
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,380
 At two, Torah obedience is actually

540
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,020
 how you lead someone to what?

541
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,300
 To intimacy, right?

542
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,860
 When someone is older, when they're 16, when they're 18,

543
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,540
 when they're a young adult, and you no longer have them

544
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,900
 under the authority of your home,

545
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,980
 they are maybe obeying, or honoring you,

546
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,220
 as another way to put it,

547
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,780
 out of the love of the relationship,

548
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,700
 and hopefully they're going to the bathroom

549
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,100
 on their own without Skittles as well, right?

550
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,620
 But whether it's just like honoring you,

551
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
 and how they talk to you, or whatever it is,

552
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,180
 Torah obedience is not there anymore.

553
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,620
 It's meant to push, it's like a push to intimacy.

554
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,900
 Are you tracking?

555
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,580
 That's actually why God started to get so upset at Israel,

556
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,380
 because they just wanted to stay there.

557
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,500
 He's like, you're not getting the point.

558
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,540
 You're not getting the point.

559
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,540
 I wanna take you farther, I wanna take you deeper,

560
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,780
 I want to lead you to intimacy.

561
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,300
 And by the way, there's even little breadcrumbs

562
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,900
 in the Torah as well, where it's very obvious,

563
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,700
 even with Moses dying outside the promised land,

564
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,740
 that obviously like this mechanism

565
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,380
 cannot be the entire thing.

566
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,980
 Something greater has to happen.

567
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,500
 It never fully gets to the place

568
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 of what it's trying to go for.

569
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,780
 And as it says later in the New Testament,

570
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,740
 it's not the problem with the law, it's the problem with us.

571
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,300
 We wanna stay in it.

572
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,060
 We actually like it, we wanna be two year olds forever.

573
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,900
 God wants to actually take you into full intimacy.

574
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,660
 So then you go from Torah to the rest of the Tanakh,

575
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,980
 which is another Hebrew word for the rest

576
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,060
 of the scriptures, essentially.

577
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,220
 And then this is where it gets interesting,

578
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,820
 because then you start to see all these books

579
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,660
 and all these writers start to wrestle

580
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,780
 with this dynamic problem we're kind of talking about

581
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,380
 right now, which by the way, can I just say,

582
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,460
 one of the things that really bothers me

583
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,820
 is when we read our Bible, we kind of read it flat.

584
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,260
 Like we read it like an instruction manual.

585
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,100
 Again, it's a story, it has an arc.

586
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,460
 The authors are talking to each other.

587
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,260
 They're wrestling with problems.

588
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,900
 They're wrestling with what's going on.

589
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,620
 They're wrestling with the tradition.

590
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,220
 So you get something like Psalm 51,

591
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,260
 where David just committed adultery

592
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,140
 and then had the guy murdered to cover it up,

593
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,740
 decently sized sin, not like I'm ranking him or anything,

594
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,740
 but pretty large.

595
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,300
 And in Psalm 51, it's his Psalm of repentance.

596
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,300
 And what does he say?

597
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,940
 He gets down to the bottom of that Psalm and he says,

598
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,660
 "God, in his apology, in his repentance to God,

599
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,900
 "if you wanted burnt offerings and sacrifices, Yahweh,

600
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,820
 "I would give them to you.

601
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,940
 "But what you truly want is what?"

602
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,860
 Depending on your translation,

603
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,620
 a broken and contrite heart.

604
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,460
 Now that sounds cute, put it on a coffee cup,

605
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,820
 but why is that actually very weird?

606
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,980
 Why is that weird?

607
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,660
 God, if you wanted burnt offerings and sacrifices,

608
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,500
 I would give them to you.

609
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,540
 Why is that, like, why does that make no sense?

610
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,060
 That's exactly what God commanded.

611
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
 Is it not?

612
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,900
 Where?

613
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,860
 In the Torah.

614
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,460
 But it's as if David is a living human being

615
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,700
 who understands what?

616
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,380
 That the Torah is actually taking us

617
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,740
 and pushing us somewhere.

618
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,140
 And so in this point in the story,

619
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,860
 he's realizing this problem of like,

620
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,900
 God, this is not ultimately what you want.

621
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,420
 This is meant to push to something greater.

622
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,260
 And what you truly want, as he says it,

623
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,460
 a broken and contrite heart.

624
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,300
 It's almost saying like,

625
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,420
 God, if you wanted Torah, I would give it to you.

626
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
 But what you truly want is intimacy.

627
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,140
 If you wanted Torah, I would give it to you,

628
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,100
 but what you want is intimacy.

629
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,140
 This is all over, by the way,

630
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,500
 in the rest of the Hebrew scriptures.

631
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 Job, same thing.

632
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,660
 Job, the book of Job opens with him giving sacrifices

633
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,980
 for sins his children might commit in the future.

634
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,940
 Is anyone that holy?

635
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,020
 Not me.

636
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,980
 Like he's guessing what sins they'll give.

637
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,140
 And he's like, I'm just gonna be so Torah obedient,

638
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,300
 I'm gonna kind of get in the DeLorean,

639
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,820
 go in the future, you know what I mean?

640
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,780
 Back to the future, shout out.

641
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,420
 Okay, favorite movie of all time.

642
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,460
 Don't need to get into it, I nerd out.

643
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,860
 Anyways, the third one was, sucked.

644
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,700
 Okay.

645
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,380
 Where was I at?

646
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,460
 Job, that's right, Job.

647
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,100
 So Job, okay, so he starts giving like,

648
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,540
 he starts sacrificing for sins his kids might commit.

649
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,980
 That's the, what I'm trying to say

650
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,820
 is that's the epitome of Torah obedience.

651
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,500
 The epitome.

652
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,140
 But yet through the trials, through the wrestling,

653
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,980
 through all of the boils and the diseases

654
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,380
 and all the hard stuff and deaths

655
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,860
 and just a brutal suffering life,

656
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,540
 he starts to begin to realize what?

657
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,780
 Oh, God does not relate to me in Torah obedience.

658
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,060
 God is not trying to talk to me

659
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,460
 or commune with me in Torah obedience.

660
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,100
 And so you get to the end of the book

661
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,700
 and it kind of has this Job prayer

662
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,020
 where he's kind of like reflecting again

663
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,780
 on everything that had just happened.

664
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,580
 And he says at the very end,

665
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,180
 he basically said, "My whole life, God, I have what?

666
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,940
 "I have heard you.

667
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,060
 "I have heard of you."

668
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,420
 And then it goes into the next verse.

669
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,940
 "But today for the first time, I what?

670
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,140
 "See you."

671
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,020
 Again, for my whole life, I've heard of you.

672
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,860
 I've heard of the rules.

673
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,740
 I've heard of the things.

674
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,860
 I've heard of all the Christian stuff I have to do.

675
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,700
 But for my first time in my life,

676
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,780
 through all of this, you have met me.

677
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,660
 You have met me.

678
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,140
 I see you.

679
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,180
 That's intimacy.

680
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,540
 God wants that for you.

681
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,500
 He wants that for you.

682
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,540
 He wants to meet you today.

683
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,540
 Whether you love the Lord now

684
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,140
 or you've never even become a Christian,

685
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,900
 today he wants to go deeper with you.

686
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,540
 He wants to go deeper with you.

687
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,820
 Micah 6, 8, I'll read one last one for time's sake.

688
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,020
 Even my Bible, by the way,

689
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,860
 like my subtitle on this text

690
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,500
 is even the question that we just asked in Genesis.

691
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,340
 You probably can't see this,

692
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,900
 but it says, "What does the Lord require?"

693
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,860
 That's not scripture

694
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,100
 because that's the translators putting that there.

695
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,340
 But it's, "What does the Lord require?"

696
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,180
 And then Micah 6, 8,

697
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,460
 "Wrestling with this same problem,"

698
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,620
 'cause it's a dynamic problem

699
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,580
 that they're trying to wrestle with.

700
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,780
 Man, this can't be it.

701
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,140
 Says this, verse six,

702
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,580
 "With what shall I come before the Lord

703
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,460
 "and bow myself before God on high?

704
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,280
 "Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,

705
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,780
 "with calves a year old?"

706
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,840
 Uh-oh.

707
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,140
 "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams

708
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,920
 "or with 10,000s of rivers of oil?

709
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,420
 "Or shall I give my firstborn

710
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,440
 "for the transgression of my sin

711
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,340
 "or the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"

712
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,660
 So he's saying just, man,

713
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,740
 if God wants one calf, why not give a thousand?

714
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
 Then it will be extra holy.

715
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,940
 He's just drawing everything out

716
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,020
 to its logical conclusion, right?

717
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,540
 If God wants this, then make it more pure.

718
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,620
 If God wants this, make it more.

719
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,000
 Verse eight, he pivots.

720
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,360
 "Know, he has told you, oh man,

721
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,080
 "what is truly good,

722
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,840
 "and what does the Lord require of you?

723
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,120
 "But to do justice, love kindness,

724
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,340
 "and walk humbly with your God."

725
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,740
 Again, Torah, Torah, Torah.

726
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,980
 No, no, no, walking, intimacy.

727
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,460
 Walking, by the way, in the whole scripture

728
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,140
 is just a euphemism for connection

729
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,380
 and relationship with God.

730
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,940
 All the people who are giants in the face

731
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,900
 that they walked with God.

732
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,120
 Intimacy.

733
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,420
 God is calling us to this place.

734
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,300
 Now, again, this part in the story,

735
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
 what's fascinating is you start to see

736
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,180
 all these writers wrestle with the problem,

737
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,680
 but they know the solution's not here yet.

738
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,740
 Are you tracking?

739
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,660
 So they're kind of saying like,

740
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,900
 I feel pushed in by this side

741
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
 of this is not all that God wants for us.

742
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,980
 God has to do something greater and deeper,

743
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,300
 but then push in by this side of it's not happening yet.

744
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,380
 It's not here yet.

745
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
 You see Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the prophets

746
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,420
 wrestle with this problem and say,

747
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,100
 a new covenant has to happen.

748
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,940
 A new thing.

749
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,420
 God has to do a new thing.

750
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,300
 And then we get to the very end of the Old Testament

751
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,500
 and we open up what act of the play?

752
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,820
 The New Testament, which who shows up?

753
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
 Again, I gave you the tip.

754
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,660
 Any question?

755
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,480
 Who do you say?

756
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,320
 Jesus.

757
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,980
 Jesus shows up.

758
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,060
 And right from the very first moment,

759
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,740
 it's this explosion of God actually putting on human flesh

760
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,220
 to walk with us.

761
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,540
 Think about the intimacy there.

762
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,380
 John chapter one says,

763
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,580
 "The word became flesh and dwelt among us."

764
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,540
 That word dwelt in Greek is the word tabernacle.

765
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,100
 He tabernacled among us.

766
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,260
 He pitched his tent in your backyard.

767
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,660
 That's my translation, okay?

768
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,920
 He pitched his tent among you.

769
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,540
 Whatever crap you're going through,

770
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,700
 whether it's something done against you,

771
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
 whether it's something you've done,

772
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,700
 whether the shame you're feeling,

773
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,060
 do you believe that God is right next to you in a tent?

774
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,180
 He's camping with you.

775
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,120
 You are not alone.

776
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,160
 The question is, have you reached out to him?

777
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,060
 Are you dwelling with him?

778
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,900
 Are you talking with him?

779
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,300
 Are you communion with him?

780
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,560
 You are not alone.

781
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,320
 I want you to hear that in whatever you are going through.

782
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,060
 And again, Jesus himself as a dynamic living person

783
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,640
 wrestles or at least talks about this problem.

784
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,860
 You get into the Sermon on the Mount

785
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,400
 and he's in direct conversation with this problem.

786
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,620
 Jesus starts to say things in the Sermon on the Mount

787
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,660
 of you have heard it said, you shall not, what?

788
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,600
 Commit adultery.

789
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,460
 But I say, if you even look at a lust,

790
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,940
 if you even look at a woman with lust in your heart,

791
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,260
 you have already committed adultery.

792
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,820
 Jesus is saying, hey, you've heard it said,

793
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,520
 Torah, Torah, Torah, but today, new thing, intimacy.

794
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,020
 That's what I want.

795
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,760
 That's what I want.

796
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,800
 So it's constantly this thread of invitation

797
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,980
 of God keeps coming to us farther and deeper

798
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,260
 to invite us into relationship with him

799
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,700
 and to be known by him and know him

800
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
 is the greatest thing of all.

801
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,600
 That's what he wants for you and with you.

802
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,820
 End with a couple of illustrations

803
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,260
 and then I'll close.

804
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,580
 God does this and shows up in Jesus

805
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,380
 and it's powerful and it's amazing.

806
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,860
 And then I'll go to two stories in a second.

807
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,320
 But one thing I just thought of actually,

808
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,700
 let me take a little tangent on,

809
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,660
 is think of the scriptures almost like a staircase, okay?

810
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,020
 Where if you think about it, every act of the play,

811
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,740
 God is kind of getting deeper

812
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,360
 or more intimate with his people.

813
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,080
 By the way, amidst rebellion

814
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,360
 and us pushing back every single time.

815
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,200
 What do I mean by that?

816
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,460
 So after the curse, you have God saying,

817
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,180
 I want to dwell with my people.

818
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,020
 So then he what?

819
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,100
 He commissions the tabernacle and the temple system

820
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,420
 so that he can dwell with them.

821
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,620
 He didn't have to do that.

822
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,820
 Did he have to do that?

823
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,580
 No, but he wanted to, his presence,

824
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,360
 he wanted to dwell with his people.

825
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,660
 Now, were they awesome or not awesome, essentially?

826
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
 Not awesome, right?

827
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,320
 They rebelled.

828
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,340
 It says they were stiff-necked and wicked people.

829
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,580
 What a, I never want to be called that, okay?

830
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,440
 But the scriptures does call us that,

831
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,700
 so we got to sit in that.

832
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,100
 Stiff-necked and wicked people.

833
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,220
 God wants to be with them,

834
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,900
 and instead of them saying, oh yes, this is so awesome,

835
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,860
 God, the creator of the universe,

836
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,780
 is making a way to dwell with us again.

837
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,660
 Amidst our sin and our rebellion,

838
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,860
 they still just push back, push back.

839
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,660
 They go worship false idols and other nations

840
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,580
 and all these different types of things.

841
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,740
 They don't honor God, his commandments,

842
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,900
 his covenants, et cetera.

843
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,140
 But God keeps pushing.

844
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,700
 It's almost like, think of the scriptures

845
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,540
 as a story of dissent.

846
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,660
 That God is actually,

847
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,980
 and another thing that does to you too

848
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,760
 is he's the momentum, he's the inertia.

849
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,420
 It does not have anything to do with you and what you do.

850
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,080
 It's actually about, you only get to respond.

851
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,940
 You only get to respond.

852
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,980
 God is moving.

853
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,700
 God is not just, he is sitting on a throne,

854
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,900
 but I wasn't gonna say he's just sitting on the couch

855
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,740
 or something like that.

856
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,580
 He's not just sitting there, vegging out.

857
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,380
 He is moving towards us.

858
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,980
 Your job is to respond, not initiate.

859
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,140
 So he's descending, and you have God the father

860
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,500
 in the temple, dwelling with us for hundreds of years,

861
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,380
 and they keep resisting, keep resisting, keep resisting.

862
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,420
 You would think finally at that time,

863
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,820
 you would finally say, okay, nevermind, peace out,

864
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,600
 I'm done, like I'm done.

865
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,440
 But what does he do?

866
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,260
 He doesn't do that.

867
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,160
 Instead, his answer, his answer to that problem of like,

868
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,440
 man, they're just wicked and rebellious

869
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,320
 is to actually always go deeper.

870
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,840
 So then the next act of the play, he shows up what?

871
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,180
 With skin on.

872
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,640
 He shows up with flesh.

873
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,760
 So he's like, I'm no longer gonna just live

874
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,720
 in this temple thing.

875
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,920
 I'm gonna become one of you.

876
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,720
 I'm gonna become one of you.

877
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,000
 And again, do you think at that point,

878
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,080
 you'd be like, yes, thank you, Lord, you're amazing.

879
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,000
 They kill him.

880
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,200
 They kill him.

881
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,940
 They crucify the Messiah, Jesus.

882
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,340
 They kill him.

883
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
 Kind of like, we don't want you here.

884
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,220
 And so you think finally, once you get killed,

885
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,660
 you'd be like, I'm done, I'm out.

886
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,860
 What's he do?

887
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,380
 Next act of the play, the book of Acts.

888
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,860
 I'm going deeper.

889
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,860
 He says, I'm gonna go deeper.

890
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,780
 I'm going to not only dwell with skin on now,

891
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,220
 I'm going to dwell inside of them.

892
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,620
 They can't get rid of me now.

893
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,100
 I'm gonna dwell inside of them.

894
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,940
 Inside of them.

895
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,040
 So it goes God in temple, God in flesh, God inside of them.

896
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,080
 And that's not the end of the story.

897
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,280
 You get all the way down to Revelation 21 and 22.

898
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,160
 And it says that heaven and earth will be put back together

899
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,520
 and God will become our very dwelling place.

900
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
 So then it reversed this, it's like inception style.

901
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,780
 And we now dwell in him.

902
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,000
 That's it.

903
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,760
 Are you tracking that story?

904
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,120
 That story is insane.

905
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,960
 Right?

906
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
 It's amazing.

907
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,340
 Thank you, amen.

908
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,860
 It's incredible.

909
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,040
 And that's what God is inviting you to.

910
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,480
 He's inviting you to his great grand story

911
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,680
 that he is descending towards you.

912
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,440
 He is coming after you.

913
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,400
 He is pursuing you.

914
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,240
 I love that.

915
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,080
 What is it?

916
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,000
 Psalm 23, where it says that goodness and mercy

917
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,140
 will follow me all the days of my life.

918
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,720
 Again, in the Hebrew, that's a little bit more like chase.

919
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,480
 He's not following, he is chasing.

920
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,560
 You're about to get tackled with goodness and mercy.

921
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,440
 I want to get tackled by goodness and mercy.

922
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
 And God's offering that.

923
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,660
 He's offering that to you right now in this place.

924
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,240
 And so I'll end with one story for time's sake.

925
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,320
 I had a couple more, but it just goes on.

926
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,140
 Okay.

927
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,120
 ADHD, anyone?

928
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,940
 Can you tell?

929
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,780
 Anyways.

930
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,680
 So we've got a few of you, shout outs.

931
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,240
 We'll do a support group after.

932
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,740
 (congregation laughing)

933
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,140
 Luke 24.

934
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,200
 God, Jesus dies, resurrects.

935
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,680
 Okay, he resurrects.

936
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
 And then this is like the most fascinating story.

937
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,820
 I don't hear it preached on very often,

938
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,580
 but it's very interesting and fascinating.

939
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,640
 So God resurrects, Jesus resurrects, excuse me.

940
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,480
 And then it says he comes alongside these two guys.

941
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,560
 Now they don't recognize him.

942
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,520
 I don't know if there just wasn't like

943
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,000
 Facebook profile pictures back then or what,

944
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,520
 or he changed it a little.

945
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,360
 I don't know what's going on.

946
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,100
 They don't recognize him, but he sees they're bummed out.

947
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,420
 So he kind of says, "Hey guys, why are you guys bummed out?"

948
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,240
 And they rebuke him, which by the way,

949
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
 never a good idea to rebuke Jesus, amen?

950
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,520
 They kind of go, they're kind of like,

951
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,880
 "Bro, what are you talking about?"

952
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 And they say, "Didn't you just see a couple of days ago

953
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,020
 "how Jesus of Nazareth, like we followed him for three years

954
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,220
 "and then he just got crucified under the Roman empire."

955
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,480
 Which by the way, even though we have all these crosses

956
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,120
 and we worship Jesus on a cross,

957
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,760
 do you realize in the first century,

958
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,840
 a man you followed that was put on a Roman execution device,

959
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,040
 you just lost and wasted three years of your life.

960
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,280
 Sit in that.

961
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,080
 You wasted three years of your life.

962
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,200
 They felt like they lost.

963
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,080
 So three years of that and they just are saying,

964
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,040
 like they don't know it's Jesus,

965
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,200
 but they're saying to Jesus,

966
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,040
 "Like what are you talking about?

967
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,280
 "We just wasted three years of our lives, we lost.

968
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,080
 "This isn't the guy, this isn't the guy."

969
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
 And then it says Jesus rebukes them back,

970
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
 which that's a good idea.

971
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,040
 You know, Jesus can rebuke us.

972
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,740
 And it says he, this is crazy.

973
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,700
 It says he begins from Moses all the way to the prophets,

974
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,440
 beginning to describe how this had to have happened,

975
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,320
 they just weren't paying attention.

976
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,440
 Okay, do you know Moses to the prophets, by the way,

977
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,800
 is pretty much a euphemism for the whole Bible?

978
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,280
 Like they didn't have a New Testament yet.

979
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,040
 The Torah is Moses, first five books of the Bible,

980
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,100
 and outside of the wisdom literature,

981
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,480
 the prophets is pretty much everything else.

982
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,960
 It's basically Jesus.

983
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,600
 Right when they say that, he just basically,

984
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,720
 it says Jesus opens up his Bible

985
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,600
 and goes from page one to the last page.

986
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
 I don't even know how long that would have taken,

987
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,220
 but it doesn't take long 'cause they've only, yeah.

988
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,840
 Anyways, opens up the whole Bible

989
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,200
 describing how this was supposed to happen.

990
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,720
 You missed it.

991
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,660
 You weren't paying attention.

992
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,960
 You weren't reading close enough,

993
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,060
 which by the way, read closely.

994
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,800
 Can we be people that read closely?

995
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,640
 Read closely, be saturated in the word, sit in the word,

996
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,160
 'cause he's communicating to us.

997
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,660
 But here's what's crazy about that story.

998
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,620
 Jesus himself, the uppercase word,

999
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,840
 starts unpacking the entire lowercase word.

1000
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,160
 And guess what?

1001
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,640
 Nothing happens.

1002
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,880
 Nothing happens.

1003
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,920
 Like literally the next sentence is like five hours

1004
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,760
 later that day.

1005
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,720
 It says later that day, they were going to the house.

1006
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,200
 Can we just sit and how ridiculous that is?

1007
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
 Like I would expect if Jesus

1008
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,880
 is my personal Bible study partner

1009
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,000
 that I would have heavens open up

1010
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 and there'd be people singing.

1011
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,840
 Right?

1012
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,680
 So many of us, we wish that.

1013
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,240
 If Jesus could just show up in my room

1014
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,880
 and give me all the answers, give me all the stuff, right?

1015
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,720
 But you know what's crazy?

1016
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,560
 Nothing happens.

1017
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,380
 And then it gets even weirder.

1018
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,880
 Later that day, they go to his house

1019
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,800
 or they go to their house

1020
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,520
 and they ask Jesus to stay for a meal.

1021
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,560
 And then it says, Jesus sits down,

1022
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,680
 breaks bread with them.

1023
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,040
 And in an instant, their eyes were opened.

1024
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,640
 That makes no sense.

1025
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,080
 So over here, Jesus is unpacking

1026
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,800
 the entire scriptures to them.

1027
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,820
 Nothing happens.

1028
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,620
 Over here, he breaks the Chick-fil-A.

1029
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:36,560
 That is a strange story.

1030
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,280
 Can we first admit that?

1031
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,120
 Unless what?

1032
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,720
 Unless Jesus is trying to tell us something.

1033
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
 Again, I think so many of us,

1034
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,620
 what that is, I think it's almost too,

1035
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,480
 it's like the way that we like to operate with God

1036
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,640
 and the way that God wants to operate with us.

1037
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,200
 See, we wanna operate with God.

1038
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,040
 Jesus, just give me all the answers.

1039
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,400
 Give me all the answers.

1040
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
 He says, my translation is shut up, sit with me.

1041
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,100
 Be quiet and sit with me.

1042
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,040
 I wanna eat with you.

1043
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,020
 I wanna dine with you.

1044
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,440
 Notice how they get revelation.

1045
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,240
 Like maybe God's actually blocking revelation

1046
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,920
 and epiphany from you because you just want the answers.

1047
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,760
 You haven't sat with him.

1048
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,240
 So many of us, we want,

1049
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,120
 another way to think about it is we almost want Jesus

1050
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,800
 to give us all the answers so that we can leave him.

1051
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,440
 'Cause when you get all the answers,

1052
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,540
 who do you not need anymore?

1053
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,040
 That sounds a lot like the knowledge of tree

1054
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,880
 of good and evil, doesn't it?

1055
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,560
 Same thing, same point.

1056
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,140
 But God's saying, that's not how I operate.

1057
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,380
 You can keep eating of that fruit.

1058
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,760
 You can keep eating of that tree,

1059
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
 but that's not how I operate.

1060
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,160
 How I operate is I want to feast with you.

1061
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
 I want to sit at a table with you.

1062
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,680
 I want to dine with you.

1063
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,360
 And now notice, they're not pitted against each other.

1064
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,840
 It actually says, they say, when they have the epiphany,

1065
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,040
 it says, "Did our hearts not burn within us

1066
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,880
 "as he unpacked the scriptures to us back on the path?"

1067
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,700
 So they go together.

1068
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,560
 You get the scriptures and you get revelation

1069
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,120
 by sitting at the table with Jesus.

1070
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,000
 That's the invitation today.

1071
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,560
 Have you sat at the table with him?

1072
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,760
 Do you dine with him?

1073
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,360
 Do you feast with him?

1074
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,800
 I don't know what kind of stories are in this room,

1075
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,040
 but whether it can be, you know,

1076
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,320
 you're struggling with shame and guilt and pain

1077
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,560
 from, you know, sleeping with your boyfriend

1078
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,680
 or your girlfriend and just feeling like,

1079
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,920
 ah, this doesn't feel right.

1080
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,880
 It can be maybe an abortion you've had in the past.

1081
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,140
 It can maybe even abortion you've scheduled in the future.

1082
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,120
 It can maybe be even a level of perfection

1083
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,360
 that you struggle with, but it's weighing you down

1084
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,600
 because you're putting your identity in it.

1085
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,440
 Whatever it is in this room,

1086
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
 God is saying, I don't care, just sit with me.

1087
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,480
 Sit with me.

1088
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,640
 The goal from page one is still the same goal.

1089
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,120
 I want to know you and I wanna be known by you.

1090
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,600
 And that's the invitation, that you would taste

1091
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,080
 and see that the Lord is good.

1092
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,640
 And it says in 2 Corinthians, I don't know where,

1093
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
 somewhere three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

1094
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
 somewhere in there.

1095
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,080
 It's in, I'm gonna butcher it too,

1096
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,120
 but it's essentially the summary of God saying,

1097
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,200
 Paul saying, when we sit at the feet of Jesus

1098
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,920
 and we behold him, we actually become more and more like him

1099
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,100
 and we begin to emanate ourselves.

1100
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,320
 Like Moses in the Old Testament,

1101
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,200
 when he sat at the face up on the mountain,

1102
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,440
 he came down glowing.

1103
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,880
 Might we be people who go into our city,

1104
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,520
 who go into our marriages, who go into our lives,

1105
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,400
 glowing because we've sat at the table with Jesus.

1106
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,040
 Our world needs a lot more glowing people, does it not?

1107
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,400
 More glow, more love, more gentleness, more patience,

1108
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,680
 more goodness, more beauty.

1109
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,640
 And so that's the invitation for you tonight, today.

1110
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,360
 Wherever you're at, might we just sit

1111
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,640
 at the table with Jesus?

1112
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,080
 Let me pray for you.

1113
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,080
 Jesus, we thank you for who you are.

1114
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,680
 We thank you for what you're doing right now

1115
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,760
 in this space and in this moment.

1116
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,560
 Lord, I just pray for a room this size,

1117
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,200
 there's a million stories going on right now,

1118
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,480
 a million trajectories, people all over the map.

1119
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,280
 But the best part is you just ask us to sit with you.

1120
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,600
 So Lord, let us hear that invitation today

1121
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,960
 that you want to feast with us.

1122
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,600
 You want to dine with us.

1123
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,080
 And what better invitation than getting an invitation

1124
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,040
 from the King of the universe?

1125
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,480
 Let us be humbled by the fact that we have even said no

1126
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,520
 to that invitation and how we've lived

1127
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
 and how we've acted and how we've spoke.

1128
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,760
 Lord, we thank you for who you are.

1129
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,680
 I thank you for this room.

1130
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
 And Lord, let us just be people that say yes,

1131
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,560
 every day, every moment, every year.
