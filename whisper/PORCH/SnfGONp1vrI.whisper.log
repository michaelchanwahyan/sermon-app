[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   [Music]
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   [Cheering]
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I am so excited.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   I am sincerely so excited
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   to be with you guys tonight.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This message, this scripture,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   has really ministered to me.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Even in preparing it for you
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and preparing it for this evening
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   has really ministered to me.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Let me just start with asking this question.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Have you guys ever had to carry a bunch of chairs?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Have you ever done that?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   If you've been to the launch retreat with us,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   we put out a thousand chairs,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   we've got to collect a thousand chairs.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   You're loading them up, the folding chairs,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and you're carrying them in a cart.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   What that means is people spread out and they're helping.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   You've seen the scene where you're folding up the chairs
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and you're carrying them.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Everyone carries, if you've ever noticed,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   everyone carries different amounts of chairs.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Right?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   My ten-year-old daughter,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   she's got her and David Marvin,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   they each have one in each hand.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Then you've got Blake McJunkin,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   like big Blake.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   He's carrying 27 chairs
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and just kind of walking up effortlessly
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and like setting them down.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Everybody has different stacks.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   They carry them different ways.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   They can carry different amounts of chairs.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Every now and then,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   someone will drop them.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Those aluminum chairs on that concrete floor,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   it's loud.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It makes this loud noise,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   this big commotion.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   The only reason
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   anyone would ever drop the chairs
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   is because they carried more
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   than they were supposed to.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   They thought they could carry this many,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   but they didn't have a grip.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   One slips out
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   and it just makes this big commotion.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Everybody turns around, stops,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   "What's going on over there?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Oh, so-and-so dropped the chairs again."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I start there
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   because it's been an interesting season for me.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I just want to let you in
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   in my world a little bit.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I metaphorically
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   and metaphorically
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   speaking, I think I carried more chairs
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   than I was supposed to
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   this summer.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I had a friend
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   really close to me, someone I love,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   got sick
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and I started
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   stepping into their life
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and helping them and visiting doctors
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   with them and going to appointments
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   with them and
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   really bearing
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   that burden with them.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I didn't realize how much
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   stressful and how difficult it was.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In the midst of speaking
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   engagements, I taught at several
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   different camps and was traveling this summer.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Summers are really busy speaking time.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I was scheduled
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   to teach 25 times
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   in six weeks.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   That was kind of going on.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I signed a book deal.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'm writing a book
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   to you guys, really. It's called "Welcome to Adulting."
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   There were deadlines.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   The deadlines were
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   kind of hanging over me.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I picked up another chair
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and I picked up another chair
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and I picked up another chair.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I didn't realize how many I had.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I went down to Austin
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and I taught at a big church in Austin.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Great opportunities.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I loved to teach the Word of God.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I loved to share the gospel.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I went down there and taught three times,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   back to back to back.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I was on the road. I was driving back to Dallas
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   in a large church on the West Coast called
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   one of the largest churches in the world,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Rick Warren's church, if you know about it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I said, "Hey, can you come and speak here
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   next Sunday, next weekend?"
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I said, "Man, I'd be honored."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I came home and I taught here.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I got on a plane and I flew to California.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I was sitting in my hotel room.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I was laying in the hotel bed.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It was the night before I was teaching.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The next day,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   it was going to be streamed
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   to 13 campuses,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   30,000 people.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I'm laying in bed and I can't sleep.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I'm like, "Man, why can't I sleep?"
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I've got to sleep. I've got to teach.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I've got to teach tomorrow.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I'm going to be in front of 30,000 people.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   They brought in this silly guy from Texas.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I've got to have my act together.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Lord, help me sleep.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   When you try to sleep, you can't sleep.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I'm laying there and I'm like, "Why can't I sleep?"
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I feel my heart just go boom.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Ba-da-ba-boom.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Ba-da-ba-boom.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Something's not right.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Something's not right with my heart, my physical heart.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Something's wrong.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I can't sleep. Something's wrong with my heart.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I get through the night.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I go the next day. I teach three times.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I'm supposed to.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I get on a plane. I come back to
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Dallas.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I'm sitting in my house now.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Ba-da-ba-boom.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Ba-da-ba-boom.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Thunder beats in my chest.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I go to the emergency room.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   "Hey, guys. Something's not right."
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   They hooked me up to an EKG, all these
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   machines and wires.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I said, "Yeah, I see some PVCs."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm like, "What are PVCs?"
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   "Pipes? What are you talking about?"
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   They're like, "No. Premature ventricular contractions."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   "Oh, man. That doesn't sound good."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's just something I've been dealing with.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Asking the Lord, honestly, to take from me.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   But in it, I see
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   His extreme mercy.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I don't believe that
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   all health issues are caused by sin.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Certainly don't believe that.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That's a gross heresy.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   But as I look at my own,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I can see a sin
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   attached to it.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   The sin that is attached to it
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   is the sin of pride.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's the pride of a Savior complex,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   thinking that I'm the only one that can help somebody.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Moving into their situation,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   instead of allowing them to lean on their community,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   it's the sin of
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   finding identity and success
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and book deals.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The sin of wanting
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   people to think much of me
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   and not being able to say no.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Not wanting to say no because every time you say yes,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   you're saying no to something.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I didn't realize that, so I just kept saying yes.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I kept saying yes, and going here,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   and flying here, and doing this.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I'm thinking, "Man, this is all great."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Before you know it, you start leaning on your own gifts,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   which is a sin.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Just leaving God out of it and just going,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "I do this routine."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   The sin of routine, where it's like,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   "I'm going to step up there, I'm going to put a microphone on,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'm going to speak, I'm going to open the Word, I'm going to teach,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'm going to give this illustration."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   You're just going through these things.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   It was the sin of pride.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Pride is the grossest sin.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   The mother of all sins.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   In fact, C.S. Lewis
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   says this about pride.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Pride is the...
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   He says, "According to
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Christian teachers, the essential vice,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   the utmost evil, is pride.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Unchastity, or being
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   unpure,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   anger, greed, drunkenness,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and all that are mere
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   flea bites in comparison.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   It was through pride that the devil
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   became the devil.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Pride leads to every other vice.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   It is the complete anti-God
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   state of mind.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Pride says that, "I want to be
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   like God." Lucifer, in the kingdom of heaven,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   fell from heaven with the fallen angels.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   He says, "God, I don't want to worship you.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I want to be like you." Adam and Eve, in the garden,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   says, "God, we don't trust you. You say
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   that that's not good, but we want to see
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   what it is. We think maybe you're holding goodness
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   from us. That's pride."
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's the biggest
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   struggle in the room
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   today, and it's the biggest struggle
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   of everyone listening
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   this evening.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And I believe pride...
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Pride is the source of your anxiety.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   If you find
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   yourself anxious, I want
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   you to trace it back to pride. I know
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   that's not helpful. I know that's not
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   helpful. I understand that when I
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   say pride is the source of your anxiety, it doesn't
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   help you be less anxious. But if
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   it's true,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I think we can find something helpful
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   in that truth, especially in this
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   verse we're going to be
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   in. And so we're starting a new series
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   tonight. I know it's the end of the year. This is
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   the series that we will kick the year off. It's called
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Vice and Virtue. Vice
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and Virtue, where every week we will look at a
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   vice and a virtue, the menaces and the marks
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   of Christianity.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   And so tonight, the subject is
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   pride and humility, the vice and
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   the virtue, pride and
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   humility as we dive
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   in on this specific topic.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And so there's some questions I can ask you to see if you
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   struggle with pride.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Are you anxious?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Are you critical
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   of others?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Are you defensive when someone
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   points out sin in your life?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Do you justify?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Explain it away. Do you quickly notice
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   pride in others? He's prideful. She's so
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   prideful. Do you constantly
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   seek out others' approval?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Are you
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   insecure?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Do you take advantage of
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   God's grace?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Do you feel
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   shame? Or
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   think your sin or brokenness is bigger
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   than God's grace? Do you believe
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   that you are worthless or unforgiven?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   That's prideful. Does a particular
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   sin define you
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   more than God's claims on your life?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I believe this vice, more than
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   any other sin, is robbing you of God's
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   favor,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   His blessing,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   His joy,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and His abundant
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   grace.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And if you
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   fall into this sin,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I'm warning you tonight,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   the chairs you're carrying, they are
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   going to come crashing down.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It is only a matter of time.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   It's only a matter of time
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   before there's a big
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   noise and a commotion around
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   you. And at the base
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   of it is pride.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I'm going to be in 1 Peter 5.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   If you want to turn there
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and your Bibles are on your phones,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I want to welcome those tuning in from
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   around the world, especially our friends in Fort Worth
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   this evening, our friends in
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Houston, and those that
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   are joining the stream online through
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   the app. In 1 Peter
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   5, I'll read the Scripture to
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   you, and before I do, I want you to know
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   this has been a lifeline for me. I don't know that
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   my heart's ever been more around a Scripture that I've
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   taught, because when that happened to me
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   this summer, what I did is I took a dry erase marker
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and I wrote this on my mirror.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And every morning and every night, I would
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   read it to myself, this specific Scripture.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   This is what it says. "All of you,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   everyone, clothe yourself with humility
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   toward one another, because
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   God opposes the proud," from the Proverbs.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   "God opposes the proud, but shows
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   favor to the humble. Humble yourselves
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   therefore under God's mighty hand,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   that He may lift you up in due time.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Cast all your anxiety on
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Him, because He cares for you.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   the devil, prowls around like a roaring
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   lion, looking for someone to devour.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Resist him, standing
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   firm in the faith, because you
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   know that the family of believers
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   throughout the world is undergoing the same
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   kind of sufferings.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And the God of all grace, who called you to
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   His eternal glory in Christ, after you
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   have suffered a little while, will
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Himself," that God,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Creator God, "will Himself restore
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   you and make you strong,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   firm, and steadfast. To Him
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   be the power forever and ever.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Amen." Now let me just show
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   you something real quick. Consider if you've been in church
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   for a while, how many memory verses are
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   in this little section of Scripture, back to back to back.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   You ever heard this? "Clothe yourself with humility."
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   You ever heard, "God opposes the proud
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   but gives grace to the humble." You ever heard,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   "Cast all your anxieties on Him, because He
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   cares for you." Have you ever heard, "Your enemy, the
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   someone to devour." All
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   those verses are jam-packed right
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   here in this little section of Scripture,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   back to back to back. And they all seem like
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   new ideas. I want to show you, I don't think they are.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I think that they're
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   tied together. And so as we move through
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   this, we're going to look at how pride brings opposition,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   humility brings help.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And before you leave here
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   this evening, Peter,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   who wrote this to
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   the persecuted church,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   is going to tell us to put on humility.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Put it on.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And so,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   it says, "All of you, clothe yourself with humility
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   toward one another, because God
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   opposes the proud but shows favor to the
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   humble." My first point this
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   evening is that pride brings opposition.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   That if you find yourself
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   thinking a lot about yourself,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   or better said,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   thinking about yourself a lot,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   you are going to find yourself
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   marching against opposition.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   The opposition of God,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   the opposition of self, and the opposition
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   of Satan. All of those
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   forces will be coming against you when
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   you begin to think about yourself
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   too much.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Now this is something that we do. When I say
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   the opposition of God, it says God opposes
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   the proud, but shows
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   favor to the humble. It says that we're to put
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   on humility. Here's what I would tell you.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Just like you identify a team by their
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   uniform, like if you're watching a game,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   you know who's playing by the colors
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   that they're wearing.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You can see whether it's the Cowboys
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   or the Mavericks or whoever it is
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   based on the uniform that they have.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   When you wear pride,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   you are wearing the uniform of the
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   other team. When I say the other
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   team, I mean the team that is playing
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   against God.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   That you have the Creator of the heavens and the
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   earth working, actively
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   working against you, the most powerful
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   force in the world.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   So he says, "Humble
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   hand, that He may lift you up in due time.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Cast all your anxiety
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   on Him, because He cares for you."
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And this verse
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   reveals something very interesting
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   and yet extremely unpopular.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   That
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   the source
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   of anxiety is pride.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And the solution
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   is humility.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Now stay with me there, don't let me lose you
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   with just a band-aid statement like
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   "the solution is humility."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   We'll dive deeper into that.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   But consider this for a moment,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   that the source of
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   anxiety is pride.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I know
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that doesn't feel helpful, but if it is true,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   then we can test it
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   and I think it will prove
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   to be helpful. Let's just consider
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   testing it for a second.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   If there's something,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   if there's someone rather,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   and they're cared for
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   by someone who
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   is all-powerful,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   they're in the care and the
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   protection of someone who is all-powerful.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   If that person feels
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   absolutely loved and absolutely
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   protected and absolutely provided
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   for, can they
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   be anxious?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And yet if we take God
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   at His promises, are we not absolutely
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   loved? Absolutely
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   provided for? And
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   absolutely protected by God, the
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   creator of the heavens and the earth?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   That a sparrow doesn't hit the ground apart
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   from His will.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And then the struggle is, "Well then,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I want to believe that, but how do I believe
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   that more? How do I jump
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   over that hurdle where I can take God at
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   His promises, that I can believe upon
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   those things?" We're going to see in the Scripture.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The core
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   of our anxiety is doubt of God's goodness,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   which is to say,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   we know better about God's character than He
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   declares. We begin
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   to question, "Is He good? Does He love us?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Can He actually protect us?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Does He have the power to protect us?"
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Anxiety is not a battle
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   against something else, but
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   it's a battle against ourselves. And so this is the
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   opposition of self. Pride brings
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   opposition.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   If you can rid yourself of pride,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   you will in turn rid yourself of anxiety.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It says, "Be alert and of sober
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   minds. Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Resist him. Resist him.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Standing firm in the faith, because you know
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   that the family of believers throughout the world
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And it seems like such a new thought,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   that he's just jumping, okay? God opposes the
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   kingdom. Cast your anxieties on Him. Hey, your enemy,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion. But they're not.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   They're not new thoughts. I think
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   what Peter is telling us
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   is that the things that we're anxious about
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   are the playpen that Satan plays in.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's the fence.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Like, he knows what we're
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   worried about. He knows what we're anxious about.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And that's where he's going after. You're never going
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   to get married. You're
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   going to stay single. You're like, "They don't like you.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Hey, you're not going to make enough
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   money. You're never going to make six figures.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   You might lose your job."
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   He knows that. He's just there. Boom. Boom.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   He's looking for the chinks in your armor,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   the gaps in your armor, and he's just shooting
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   fiery darts right there.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   He knows where you doubt.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And your pride
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   feeds that lion.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Your pride feeds that
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   lion. He feasts
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   on those things that
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   you trust in other than
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   God. He feasts on the areas
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   of your life where you don't trust
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   God and the ask, the command
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   is that you would starve him.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He's a stray cat.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   He's a stray cat.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   He's a smelly cat. Phoebe from
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Friends would write a song about him.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   That's who he is, and he's just
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   hanging around. And if you feed a stray
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   cat, what's he going to do? "Oh, man.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Give me some more. Give me some
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   more. I like that. Give me some more.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I'm not going anywhere." If you
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   starve a stray cat, what's he do?
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   He leaves.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Satan
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   works like Netflix.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Okay?
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   He does. Netflix and Satan,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   they're one and the same.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Here's
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   what he does, right? You know how Netflix works, right?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   It's like, "Oh, oh, you like
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Friends? Oh, you watch Friends?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   How about Seinfeld? How about this? How about--
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Oh, you like Stranger Things
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Episode 1 or Season 1? How about Season
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   2? Season 2 just came out. Do you like Season 2?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Oh, you like horror films.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Oh, you like violence, huh?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   How about this violence? How about this violence?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   How about this violence? How about this violence? How about this violence?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Oh, you are desperate to get
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   married. Here's some romantic comedies
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   to fill your tank.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Watch this. Watch this. Watch this.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Watch this. Watch this. You see how he works?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   You feed him, and he just
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   starts putting things in front of you. You don't even
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   realize that you're feeding the very
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   struggles that you don't want.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   That those struggles are growing because their
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   appetite's growing because you're feeding them
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   one by one through a song, through a movie,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   through a video, through the things that you like, through
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   magazines, through your Pinterest folder.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   You're just feeding them,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   and they're growing.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   They're growing. Oh.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Oh, you like to
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   look at people naked
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   in the act of sex.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Oh.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Let me put that in front
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   of you here. Let me put that in
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   front of you here. Let me put that in front
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   of you here. Let me put that in front of you
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   here. Let me put that in front of you here. Do you
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   see the lie of one last time? I'm going to look
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   one last time. I'm going to do that one last time.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And that appetite just
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   grows. That's all you did was feed something.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   It's now harder to stop.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   I'm going to do it one last time.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   No, you're not. You're going to do it
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   2,000 more times because you did
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   it one more time.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   See what you did?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   You fed him.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   When I actively looked at pornography,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   speaking of pornography,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   it was interesting. It would pop up
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   everywhere. I couldn't get away from it.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It was on my
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   computers, on my hard drive. Everywhere I
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   go, boom, there it is. Boom, there it is. Every
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   billboard, every magazine,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   I'd sit in the grocery store. Boom,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   it's in my face. Everywhere I turned, it was like
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   pornography, pornography, pornography. And I thought,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I'll never get away from it. I'm going to be
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   stuck here. I'm going to look at this for the
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   rest of my life.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And now, after
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   12 years of sobriety,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I realize
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that's not the case.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   That to see it today, it
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   takes considerable work.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   It's something that I would have to seek
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   out. It doesn't keep tripping me up.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   It doesn't keep popping up in front of me.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And you say, "Well, how did you get to
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   a place of recovery?" I asked for
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   help. I got to the end of
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   myself, and I thought, "You know what? I can't
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   defeat this thing by myself.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I need help. I need someone
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   to come in and help me. I need
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   someone to save me from this
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   thing that I'm feeding. I've grown
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   an appetite that is overwhelming.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I need help.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   I need help." And I
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   started asking for help. It's a position of humility.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Recovery starts with
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   humility.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But your pride,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   it will keep you sick.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   You say, "Man, you can't tell somebody that. You can't
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   ask for help." Oh, you asked for help once. You know,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   move on. You said something about it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You brought it up to community. They didn't do anything. Keep going.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   My second point from the Scripture is
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   that God helps the humble.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   He shows favor to the humble.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   He extends grace to the humble, your Scripture
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   may say, your Bible may say. My second point is
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   that God helps the humble. See,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I thought I'd be addicted to porn my entire
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   life, but when I started
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   asking for help, and not just asking
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   for help, but finding a greater satisfaction
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   in Jesus,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I found recovery. Let me
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   make that tangible.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Finding a greater satisfaction in Jesus.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I started being discipled. I started
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   learning the Bible. I started doing
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   all the things that you keep saying you're going to do.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. 2018,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   man, that's your year. You're going to join
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   a church. You're going to get in community. You're going to
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   memorize some Scripture. You're going to get
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   a new Bible and read it every
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   single morning. I know.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I know.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I started doing those things.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I started feeding on
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   sermons.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I started educating myself
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   to God's Word and His commands.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I started praying like my life
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   depended on it, crying out to God,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   "Please, help me, God.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I want to stop picturing
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   women naked, God.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   God, I'm perverted. Help me, Lord."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And He did.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Here's
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   what that looked like practically. I can
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   remember driving home from work every day. There's
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   a billboard on the side of
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   635. That's a highway here in
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Dallas.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And every day
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   as I'd leave work, I'd drive by that billboard
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and on that billboard was a woman in a bikini.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   It was like
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   an advertisement for some adult store
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   underneath it. And every day I'd
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   look at that. I'd lust for that every
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   day.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   On this particular day, I'm in the car
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and I'm worshiping. I had left a
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Bible study and I had community that night
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   and I had read the Scriptures over lunch
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   and I was surrounded by men who
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   loved me and knew God and who knew me and
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   loved God. And so I'm there
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   in the car and it's me and Jesus and I'm talking
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   to Jesus and I'm praying and I sense
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   that that billboard's coming up because I'm driving
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   down the highway and it's getting closer and it's
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   getting closer. But it seems like
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   it feels like Jesus is in the car
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   with me because we're talking, we're commuting.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   He feels close to me.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And as I get closer to that billboard,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   these words come out of my mouth all by myself
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   in the car. It's not worth it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   It's not worth this.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Glancing up at that
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   two-dimensional
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   woman who I don't know
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   is not worth sacrificing
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   closeness to Jesus.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   So you gotta ask every time, is a romantic
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   comedy worth it? Is watching that
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   one more time worth it? Is listening to that worth it?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Is going there with your friends worth it?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   One more drink, a shot, is it worth it?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Is it worth this?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Because the enemy's right there saying,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "Feed me. I'm hungry.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Feed me.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Feed me.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Feed me."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   But when your humble God comes to your aid,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   we have one that
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   protects us. We are protected under
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   the hand of God.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   We know our place, that we're
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   the ones that need protection and
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   we have a protector. It says, verse 6,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   "Humble yourselves therefore under God's
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   mighty hand."
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   David's, King David's
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   go-to illustration, David and Goliath,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   David and Bathsheba, David the shepherd boy,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   David, his go-to illustration,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   his go-to metaphor
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   for God was, "The Lord is
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   my," what?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   The Lord is
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   my shepherd." Now David was a shepherd.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   He knew what this meant. And what he's
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   doing is he's putting himself in the story.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   God is his shepherd. He is
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   a sheep. Now here's what's interesting about
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   being a sheep. Sheep is the most defenseless
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   animal in the animal kingdom.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   They've got no claws.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   They've got no sharp teeth. They've got no
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   thumbs. They've got nothing.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   They've got no nunchucks or nothing to protect themselves.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Right? They're sheep.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   They are sheep. They've got no
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   crazy laughs, nothing. And so,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   you know what
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   happens when a sheep is scared?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   You know what happens when a sheep is scared?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   It falls over.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   True story.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's a sponge with sticks
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   for legs. That's a sheep.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Right? And so, here's
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   the deal. You're a
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   sheep.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And if you think you're immune to pride,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   you're going to be lunch.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Because there's an enemy. There's a lion.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   A sheep without a shepherd is
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   lunch.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   But a sheep with a shepherd is loved,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   protected,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and provided for.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And we have a shepherd. We come under
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   his mighty hand. We humble
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   ourselves with a constant renewal
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   of our mind that there's a God,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   creator of the heavens and the earth, and we
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   sit under him.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   We sit under his
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   feet. We sit at his feet. We're under his
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   hands. He's our protector
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and our provider.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And as we come under his power, he lifts
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   us up, it says. That he's the force
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   behind us, pushing us forward.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And it says, "Cast all your anxieties on him
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   because he cares for you."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   It says, "Throw your anxieties
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   on him." Why? Why do I
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   throw my anxieties on him? It's like, "Throw your
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   anxieties." Like he's a coat rack. And you're,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   "Throw your anxieties on him." How do I throw
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   my anxieties? Throw my anxieties on who?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And why? And what? Because
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   God loves
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   you.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Right now. Like,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   not later. Not when you're not anxious.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Like, when you're anxious,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   he loves you.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   He loves you.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Everything you've done,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   he knows and he chose you.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   You're like, "How do I know he chose me?"
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Look around where you're at right now.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   You're at church.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   On a Tuesday
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   night. You're not at, you know,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   $2 margarita bar,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   whatever, right? No, you're here.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And it's not by chance.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And I'm not saying because you're here, you're saved.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I'm saying because you're here, he's pursuing
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   you.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And you need to come to the end of yourself
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   and look up and say, "God, I'm ready.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   I'm ready.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I need your help."
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   He loves you.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   And we're about to go on a break.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Not gonna meet for
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   a few weeks.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And I want you to change
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   some things about your life.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I want you to stop playing
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   games. I want you
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   to get serious about this
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   relationship with Jesus.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   I want you to start talking to him.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I want you to carve out
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   some time every single day and prioritize
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   him. And even when you're doing
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   the other things that you do, you're
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   prioritizing him in your mind. You're thinking
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   that he's sending you to places, the places
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   that you're going, to work and the conversations
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and the meetings and the classrooms, that
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   God's sending you there.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And what he wants
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   from you most is he wants a relationship.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   He cares for you.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And he wants you to
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   cast your anxieties on him. What does that mean?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   You talk to him about what you're concerned
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   about. I'll give you a picture of mine.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I've got a son,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   five-year-old, Weston.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He's a good boy.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   We're sitting in the living room. He's sitting
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   by the fire. It was cold the other day in Dallas
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   and we've got
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   a fire going and he's sitting by it on the
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   hearth, you know, the stone hearth there.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And I'm sitting on the couch and I'm thinking,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   you know, the stone hearth there. And I'm sitting
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   on the couch and
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   he says, and he's five-year-old way, he says,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   "Daddy," I'm like, "Yes, yeah, buddy."
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   "I'd like to talk
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   with you."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I was like, "Okay, man."
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   But I get the sense like this is
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   something serious, like not just
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   monster trucks and remote-controlled cars.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Like he wants to chat. And so he's
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   sitting there and so I come and sit on the
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   other side of the fireplace just like him.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And so we're both kind of sitting there toes-to-toes,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   just like this. I'm like, "What's up, buddy?" I'm looking at him.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I'm like, "What's up, buddy?" And I'm like, "Talk to me."
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And he's like, "Daddy, I just don't know
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   why I do what I do."
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   I'm like, "What did you do?"
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   You know? And
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   he's like, "Daddy, it's like my mind,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   like these things come to my mind and
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   the things that I want to do I don't
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   do, but the things that I don't want to do,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   these things I keep on doing."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   for those of you
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   that know the Bible, that's
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Romans 7. He's preaching.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And he's just preaching
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   at me and I'm like, "Buddy," and this is what
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I say. And he's just struggling. I'm, dude, tears
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   in his eyes. I'm tormented right now.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I said, "Well, buddy, that's why you have me."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   He said, "Man, I'll help you to know what to do
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and you can ask me and when you've done something
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   that you shouldn't have done, you can come to me.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And as much as I'm able, I'll
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   make it right. And if I'm not able to make it right,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   then you'll come with me and we'll go
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   in it together and we'll say, 'Man, look what we did.'
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And I'll help you.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And I'll do that for the rest of your life. That's really my commitment
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   to you.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   If you don't know what is
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   right and what is wrong, I'll tell you
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and if you've done wrong,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   if you've done the wrong thing,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   you can come to me and I'll do everything I can
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   to help you out of that wrong thing
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and to point you back to the right way.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   That's my commitment to you."
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And he says,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   "Daddy,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I'm really glad we had this talk."
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   [laughter]
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I said, "Me too, buddy." I mean, it melted my heart, right?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I said, "Hey,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   you're a good boy."
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He said, "You're a good daddy."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   I know, that's what I said. I'm like, "I'm done.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I'm done."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And, um,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   and it was just the sweetest thing
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and here's what I thought after that.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   I'm like, "That's what God wants from me."
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Do you see just
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   the humility there?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Like, "God, can we talk?"
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   "Daddy,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   the things
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   that I want to do,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   I don't do and
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   the things that you tell me not to do,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   those things I keep doing, I keep going
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   back to her, I keep looking at that,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I keep clicking on that, I call him again.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I want that.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   That list of Ten Commandments,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I've broken all of them.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I need your help.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   From this moment forward,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   can you
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   convict me ever so severely
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   in the situation that I would always choose right?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And when I've chosen wrong,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   will you help me?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Will you remind me to come to you
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   that you can make it right
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   even when I've chosen wrong?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   That you can show me a way out of that?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Will you help me?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Will you remind me to come to you
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   that you can make it right
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   even when I've chosen wrong?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   May that mark your break.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Lots of
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   conversations like that.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It's a huge act of faith.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's probably the most
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   productive, no, it is the most
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   productive thing that you can do.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It allows God to remind you that He
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   can handle your problems and how can He remind you
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   if He doesn't have the opportunity to remind you
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   if you're not going to Him with your
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   problems, if you're not going to Him with
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   your anxiety. See, anxiety,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   when it drives you to prayer, is a gift.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Anxiety
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   that pushes you to God,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   that is a gift.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   But anxiety that distracts you from
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   God, it is a curse.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   It is the enemy's playpen.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   It's where he's jacking
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   with you and he'll keep jacking
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   with you because he loves to distract
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   you from God. It's his goal.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And so we'll summarize,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   or we'll wrap up rather,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   with the
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   exhortation, the admonishment to
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   wear humility. He says, "Clothe
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   yourself in humility."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   It's how he starts. "Clothe yourself
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   in humility that we're His,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   that we belong to God, therefore we have
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   a new uniform. We've got new team
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   colors. We've got something else to
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   wear." Salvation actually starts with humility,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   right? Because salvation starts with
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   you coming to a place saying, "Hey God, I
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   can't. I need help."
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   We're looking at the Ten Commandments and the
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Thou Shalt series and it's like, "I've broken that one, I've
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   broken that one." The law, the only thing,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   listen closely, the only thing the law can
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   do is show you that you can't keep the
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   law. That's Romans 8.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And if you see that you can't
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   keep the law, then you realize you need someone
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   to save you from yourself.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   That's Jesus. That's the power of the
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   gospel. God doesn't expect you to
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   keep the law. He expects you to realize that
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   you can't keep the law so that you come to
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   a place so that you realize that you need a
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Savior. And do you know that
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   a Savior's job description is saving?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Jesus is really,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   really, really good at moving
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   toward people in their time of need.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   He's the best at it.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And so you come to a place
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   where you say, "God, I need help." That's
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   a place of humility. And that's where
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   salvation starts. And in that moment,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   you have new clothes to wear. Those are the
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   clothes of humility. That you would
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   clothe yourself in humility. What does that mean?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   That means that when somebody looks at you,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   they don't see somebody peacocking,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   they don't see someone rolling around saying, "Hey,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   look at me. I'm the big man on
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   campus. I'm Mr. Dallas,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Mr. Fort Worth, I'm Mr. H-Town."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   No, they see somebody
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   and say, "I'm a servant of the king.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   I don't need you to
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   like me. I don't need you to think more of me.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   I don't need more trinkets and treasures.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   I serve the king. All the trinkets
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   and treasures are his.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   I just carry his chair.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I'll sit at
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   his throne. I'm a servant."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   So you clothe yourself
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   in humility.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   What that tells me, guys,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   and consider this,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   that tells me that humility is something
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   you actively put on. That it
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   doesn't naturally happen. That pride naturally
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   happens. In the flesh, pride
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   will consume you, but you have to work.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   You have to do something to
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   put on humility. And so consider
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   when it's cold outside. Remember when you were
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   little, it's cold outside, and your mom's like, "Hey,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   you need to put on a coat." "Why do I need to put on
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   a coat?" "Because it's cold outside. And if you
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   don't put on a coat, you're going to be cold."
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Now, picture yourself at the
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   beach. There's no clouds in the sky.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   The sun's at high noon. It's coming down
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   hot. It's 127
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   degrees in Texas, and there you are.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   And somebody says, "Hey, you better
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   put on some sunscreen.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Because if you don't put on sunscreen,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   you're going to get burned."
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And what
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Peter's telling us, what the Holy Spirit is
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   telling us through His servant Peter
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   is that we've got to put on
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   humility or else we are standing in
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   opposition to the most powerful
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   force in the universe.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And that ain't going to go well
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   for us.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And so we put on
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   humility.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   What does this look like
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   practically?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Every day you've got things to do.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   You've got meetings every day. Some of
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   you have got a Microsoft Outlook calendar.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   It kind of tells you where you need to go
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   and when. And so I've got a friend,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   one of the most godly men I know,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   and every day he wakes up.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And the same way that I wake up and I think about, "Okay, what do
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I have today? I'm teaching at the porch.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   What am I going to wear?"
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I don't have any meetings.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   "Hey, it's casual Friday. I'm going to
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   wear athletic shorts." You think about
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   what you're going to wear based on what
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   you have to do. And so every day my friend,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   he wakes up, he looks at
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   his appointments, and he looks at the meetings
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   and he's like, "Man, I'm going to have to really wear some humility
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   to that one."
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   She annoys me.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   I'm not pointing at you. I'm pointing
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   at imaginary
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   "She annoys me."
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And so for that
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   one I'm going to have to really put on some humility.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   "Oh man, when I go home for Christmas
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   that one,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I'm going to have to really wear
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   some humility. When I go to that meeting,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   oh I've got my funnel review,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   oh I've got that appointment with the boss, appointment with the
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   principal, oh when I meet with those
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   parents,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I'm going to have to really wear humility
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   to that one." And you
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   consciously think about it.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And you humble yourself
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   under God's mighty hand. And you
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   clothe yourself in humility.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Because what it says, think about what it says,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   it says, "And God will exalt you.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   God will lift you up. God will take
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   care of you." Now I want to say something
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   important here.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Those are not expectations.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They're explanations.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Because if you say, "Well I'm going to leave here and
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   I'm going to be humble so that God can exalt me,"
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   that's being prideful. It doesn't
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   work that way. You say, "Hey,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I'm going to leave here and I'm going to be humble because
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   God is God.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And I'm a servant."
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And then what he does
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   as an explanation for that person
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   who's truly humble, he lifts
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   up, he exalts.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   So you don't be humble to be exalted.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   You be humble because
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   you understand who God is.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And so,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   we're dressing up in humility. Like I
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   said, my friend literally plans out his
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   day based on where he needs to wear
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   humility. And to say something
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   in a different way, it's Peter saying,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   "Hey, humility looks good on everyone."
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Okay? It's that little black dress you
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   can wear to the funeral and the wedding
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   and on the date. You know, humility is that
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   button-down shirt that you told
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   your friends is illegal in 48 states because you
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   look so good in it. Like that is
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   humility, right?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   So you wear that.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   You put it on just like
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   that shirt.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   And I want you to know, and we'll
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   wrap up with this idea,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   is that you're not the only one
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   wearing this uniform.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   You're not the only
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   one wearing this uniform. See, it says, "Resist
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   him standing firm in the faith
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   because you know that the family of believers throughout
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   the world
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   is undergoing the same kind of suffering."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And this is an important
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   aspect of humility.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   The humble, humble people
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   know that they are tempted
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   just like
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   everyone else.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   All the other people who
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   are wearing the same kind
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   of uniform. And so, maybe
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   you're sitting there and moments ago, you're like,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   "Man, how does he talk about
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   pornography so freely? I can't even say the word."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And like he just talks about,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   like, "Really? Gosh, that prayer was
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   graphic. Wow."
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And here's how.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Because I know you struggle just like I do.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Guys and girls alike
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   all over the planet Earth,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   we struggle in the same
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   ways. And when you
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   start saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   get it, man. You haven't been where I'm at.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   You haven't struggled with this kind of depression
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   that I have or this anxiety
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   it's unique to me." Or, "Hey, bro, what
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   do you know about same-sex attraction?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   You haven't walked in my shoes. You don't know what it's like.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   What do you want to be? To be celibate my entire
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   life?" You've taken a position of pride.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Can I tell you something?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   See, what happens is when I get done preaching up here,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   as I stand up here, and then what happens is you guys
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   come up and you want to chat. And then what happens
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   is the same thing every
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   single week is somebody comes
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   up, they look over. And I don't mean, I'm not trying to
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   be disrespectful in this. I'm just
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   saying what happens. They look over their shoulders,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   "Hey, man, can I talk to you? Hey, you mind
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   if we come over here?" I'm like, "No,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   you can talk to me right here. What's up? What's going on?"
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "Oh, man, I just like,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   you know, I struggle
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   with same-sex attraction, bro. And just like
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   there's no other Christians who
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   do that. And I'm just by myself and I'm the only
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   one." And then we pray and we talk
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   and we pray and hopefully say something
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   helpful. And then he leaves or she
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   leaves and somebody else comes up. "Hey, man,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   mind if I talk to you over here?"
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   "What's up? Talk to me right here."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   "Man, I just struggle with same-sex attraction.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I'm the only one here." I'm like, "No, you're
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   not. See that guy over there?"
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I don't do that.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   I don't do that. But it's
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   every week. And listen, I
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   picked on one thing. Let me go with another,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   okay? I picked on one story. Let me go with another.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   "Hey, my struggle
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   is the same as yours."
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   "What do you mean?"
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   "Oh, pornography."
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   "Yeah, do you mind? Can I talk
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   to you?" "No, it's good. You're good.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Talk to me right here. What's up?" "I want to help."
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   "Man, I'm just really struggling with
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   porn. How do you access pornography?"
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "I'm on my phone, bro.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   My phone." "Where's your
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   phone right now?"
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   "It's in my pocket."
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   "You're not struggling.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   You're carrying the lion around with you
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   in your pocket.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   You hadn't started
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   struggling. You're just feeding.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   You're not fighting.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   What do you
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   want me to do? Get rid of my phone?" "Sure."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   "Yes."
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   End of word.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   "What am I supposed to have? A flip phone?"
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   "Yeah, why not?
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Get you a flip phone.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Get you a razor. Remember those things? They were cool.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   You know?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Everybody had a razor.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Get you a razor.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   You won't have to look at porn.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Can't look at porn on a razor.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   It's all grainy.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   You know? That's not cool."
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Here's what I mean, okay?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   I think I ruffled some feathers
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   on that last one, so let me just hear me out
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   on this, okay? I know that Peter's
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   writing to the persecuted church.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   He's writing at a time when Christians are
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   literally fed to lions. I get that.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   And I think the way that
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   the verse applies to
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   the church today in a time of
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   abundance where we can worship freely and
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   raise our hands and bring our Bibles in public,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   it can apply to
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   temptation in the same way that 1 Corinthians
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   10:13 does. 1 Corinthians 10:13
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   says this, "No temptation
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   has seized you except what is
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   common to mankind."
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   And God is faithful.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   He will not allow you to be tempted
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   beyond what you can bear.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   And when you are tempted, He will provide
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   a way out so that you can stand up under it.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Here's what He's saying. God will never
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   put you in a cage with a lion and lock
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   the door. If He ever puts you in a
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   cage with a lion, He's going to give you a key.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   He's going to show you a way out.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   He's going to put a bright red exit
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   sign up saying, "Hey, come this way.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Don't jack with that lion. Don't feed
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   that lion. You come with Me.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   I've got something
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   better for you."
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And so your situation is not
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   unique. You are tempted
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   just like millions of other people are
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   tempted. And you
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   can stand firm in the same
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   way that Jesus in the garden stood
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   firm. Peter stood firm.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   The Apostle Paul stood firm.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   The saints that have gone before you
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   for centuries and centuries
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   and centuries have stood firm.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   You too can stand firm. You
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   do not ever for the rest
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   of your life have to sin.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Ever. It will never happen.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   That you
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   will always have a choice to make.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I can feed my
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   flesh. I can feed the
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   lion. I can come in the
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   opposition of God or I can
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   humble myself and walk out the door.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Get out of the
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   cage.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   I can move on.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I can choose something better.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And you say,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   "Man,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   you don't understand.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Life of celibacy,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   man, that's terrifying."
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   It is for a little
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   while. And then
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   you go to heaven.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And then it's not.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And so
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   you say, "What do I do?" Let me ask you this. Is there
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   anything you could do today to pursue God more?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Do that.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Do that. And the God of all grace,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   verse 10, who called you to His eternal
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   glory in Christ, "After you
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   have suffered a little while, will Himself restore
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   you and make you strong, firm
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   and steadfast." You see, He says
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   He'll make you strong, firm and steadfast. He will
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   help you carry the chairs.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   He will help you carry the weight of life.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   You don't have to do it on your own.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   That when you humble yourself,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   God, the strongest
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   being in the history of history, will
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   come beside you and help
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   you and make you strong, firm
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   and steadfast. And then He ends in worship
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   to Him be the power forever
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   and ever. Amen. And I love
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   that idea that earthly humility
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   leads to eternal worship.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   See, you don't need to be king here.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You need to know the king here.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   You can stop going through
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   this life saying, "Hey, look at
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   me and how many followers do I have?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   And how many likes did I get? And I want
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   people to love me and to know me and to like me."
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   You just go through life saying, "Hey, I know
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   the king and I'm loved by him."
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   And you're a road
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   sign.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   You're a road sign pointing to King
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Jesus. That's your
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   role. You know those guys
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   that whenever
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   there's a king, like in those movies where there's a bunch
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   of guys carrying the throne, walking
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   down the street, holding them up.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   You've seen that in a... That's your role.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   You carry the king's chair
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   for the rest of your days.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   That's your role.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Embrace that. Sometimes
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   humility starts with just embracing
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   obscurity. "I'm okay if I'm not
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   known. I'll preach
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   the gospel, die and be forgotten.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   I'm okay
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   if you don't like me.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   I want to tell you the truth with grace.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I want to point you to
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Jesus. I want
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   to show you the way.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   You need to be okay if they don't like you.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   You need to be
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   okay if you're alone like Noah
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   building an ark like a crazy
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   man. You just embrace obscurity.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   It's
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   alright.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   You're going to die like everybody else has died.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   If you've trusted in Christ, you're going to go be with
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Him forever. Your
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   obscurity down here won't matter
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   there."
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Moving toward Christmas.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   When my son
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   prays, the same little boy prays.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   He
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   always says the
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   same thing. He says, "God,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   thank you that we get presence
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   on your birthday."
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   I love the observation
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   that he made himself.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   That God's a generous God and that
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   on His birthday we get presence.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   It's the
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   paradox of faith.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   That on His death we get life.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   That when
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   He loses His life, we get eternal
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   security. We get
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   eternal life.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   That when He
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   dies, our sins are
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   forgiven. That when He
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   endures the wrath of God, we get
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   freedom from that.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   That at His funeral,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   we receive salvation.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   I think that
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   God loves a humble heart because
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   God has a humble heart.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   We see that
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   humble heart just in the way that when He came
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   here, He came here to serve us.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Even with His life and even
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   in His death, He came here
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   to serve us.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   In summary, pride
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   brings opposition.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   God helps the humble.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   I encourage you to wear
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   humility.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I don't know if you guys
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   saw that Prince
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Harry is engaged. You guys see this?
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   If you've
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   been on a computer, you've seen that.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   Then
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   there's the other
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   guy. What's his name? Oh, yeah.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   William and
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Kate.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   They're pregnant.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Do you see this? Having a royal baby,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   their third child.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Just think about this for a minute. We'll wrap
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   up here.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Think about the care that that little
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   baby's going to get. Royal child.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Best
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   doctors in the whole world. In the most
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   amazing delivery room that your
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   mind can possibly fathom.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   The softest sheets.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   The
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   most incredible pajamas. Their
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   pajamas cost more than my car.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   That little baby's pajamas.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   Everybody's going to be fighting.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   The media's going to be fighting over who can
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   cover the
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   birth of that child.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Contrast
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   that with the humility of God.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   That when
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   God came here 2017
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   years ago in an event that reset the calendar,
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   He
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   came to
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   a town that you would have never heard of.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   It's like a
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   suburb of Van.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Like Lindale. That's where
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   He came. Bethlehem. You would have
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   never heard of Bethlehem except Jesus
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   was born there.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   When He came,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   the God who created
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   the entire world couldn't
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   find a room to be
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   born in. There was no
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   room.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   He went in a cave. It was a cave.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   I've been in the cave.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Supposedly the cave He was born in,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   I've been in it. It's where they kept
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   animals.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   That when the King of kings and the
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Lord of lords was born here,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   the shouts of "It's a boy!" were
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   covered with the sounds of animals.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   The delivery room was
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   filled with the stench of animal
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   feces. That was Him.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Where they put Him, they didn't know where to put Him.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   So they set Him in a feeding trough.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   A place where literally donkeys
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   and cows just had their noses to eat.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   They set Him down in there. The King
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   of kings, the one who formed you in your
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   mother's womb, the one who all
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   things were created by Him and for Him.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   The supremacy belongs to
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   Him. The fullness of the deity
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   dwelled in Him. That God, here.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   Crying.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   And as soon as He was born,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   kings wanted to kill Him.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   This little baby caused such
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   a commotion. And He would die.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   He would die. But only after
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   He lived a perfect life. A life
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   you can't live.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   And He died because you can't live it.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   He endured the wrath of God.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   The most innocent person that
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   has ever been died for your
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   pornography and for your materialism
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   and for your identity struggles
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   and for your identity and singleness
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   or marriage or wanting
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   things. Your covetousness.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Your adultery. Your fornication.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Your drunkenness.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   Went on Him.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   And so this Christmas,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   I want you
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   to spend this season
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   the way Peter ends in worship.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   I want you to worship Him.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   With your all. That's what we're
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   going to do tonight. We're just going to end the year
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   in worship. And I
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   don't want prideful
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   worship. I want you to
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   get lost in worship. A humble
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   worship. It's you and God. Just you and God.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   You sing to Him.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Like you would as if you saw
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   the Savior of the world
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   in the manger.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   I want you to sing like that.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Watch this with me.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   (music)
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   (music)
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   (music)
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.420]   (soft music)
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.840]   (soft music)
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.260]   (soft music)
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.680]   (soft music)
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:13.060]   (soft music)
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:20.280]   (soft music)
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:27.740]   (soft music)
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.160]   (soft music)
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:42.580]   (soft music)
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:49.000]   (soft music)
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:57.340]   (soft music)
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:00.760]   (soft music)
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   (soft music)
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   (soft music)
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:18.760]   (soft music)
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   (soft music)
