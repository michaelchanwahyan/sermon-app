[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.980]   - What's up, Porch?
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.140]   How we doing tonight?
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.440]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.620]   Hey, it's great to see you.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620]   My name is Timothy Atik,
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.820]   and I am one of the teaching pastors here
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.080]   at Watermark on Sundays,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.400]   as well as right here at the porch.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.200]   I'm so glad you made it tonight.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.840]   Hello to everyone in the room,
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.800]   as well as to everyone watching online
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.440]   at our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.800]   I'm thinking about you, Porch Live Des Moines,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.280]   Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Fort Worth.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.400]   I am glad that you are tuning in tonight.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.280]   I also know that there are many individuals
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.320]   just around the globe who are sitting in their apartment
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.600]   or their condo or their house tonight,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.640]   watching by yourselves.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.440]   If that's you, I'm so glad you're here as well.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.200]   We are starting a new series,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.160]   and it has the sexiest title
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   that we have had in a long time.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.040]   Here's the name of the series.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.680]   It is called Prayer.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.880]   That's not all.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.520]   It's called Prayer, How to Talk to and Hear from God.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.120]   That's the name of the series.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.040]   So we are going to be in for the next four weeks.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.120]   Here's the reason that we are calling it that.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.360]   We did not want to get creative with this one.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.840]   This is like, we want you to know
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.640]   this is what we're talking about.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.720]   We are talking about prayer unapologetically.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   Like if there's anything that my hope,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.640]   if there's anything I hope for you
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   is that you would take a step in your prayer life.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.840]   So if you don't pray,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.160]   my hope is that you would start praying.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.960]   If you pray sporadically,
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   my hope is that you would start praying regularly.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   And if you pray regularly,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.440]   my hope is that you would start praying constantly.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.840]   Like my goal is that you would grow in prayer.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.720]   I'll put it this way.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.400]   When I was in college, I had a major and a minor
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.680]   at Texas A&M University.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.040]   I majored in psychology,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000]   majored in psychology and minored in business.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.440]   And the reality is, is in the spiritual life,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.240]   our tendency will be to major in certain things
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.480]   and minor in other things.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.640]   In my own life, what I've realized
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.360]   as I look back on the decades
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.120]   that I've been walking with Jesus
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.560]   is that without thinking about it,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.720]   I majored in the word of God and minored in prayer.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.160]   And the Lord changed that in my life.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.960]   And I'm so glad that he did.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.040]   But I don't want you to go another day
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.800]   majoring in something other than prayer.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.680]   I want us to be a people who pray.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.560]   Martin Luther, the leader of the Protestant Reformation,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.920]   he said this, "To be a Christian without prayer
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.800]   is no more possible than to be alive without breathing."
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.040]   That is how important prayer is.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.680]   So tonight, we're gonna start this series
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.320]   by having a conversation about prayer.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.120]   And I figured that there was no one better
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.120]   to have a conversation about prayer with
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.080]   than my good friend, Jenny Allen.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.640]   So if you will, welcome Jenny Allen
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.520]   to the stage tonight.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.320]   - Thanks.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.160]   - Welcome to the porch.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   - I think there are probably better prayer warriors
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.040]   in the world, but I appreciate that compliment.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.360]   I am really excited to be here.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   - I'm so glad you're here.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.200]   So one of the reasons that I thought of Jenny
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.440]   is that her husband, Zach, and Jenny,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.360]   and then my wife and I,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   we're actually in a prayer group together.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.280]   So I know she prays.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.880]   Because I'm in a group with her where we pray.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.640]   If you don't know Jenny, Jenny and her husband, Zach,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.880]   I don't know how long y'all been married.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.720]   - A long time.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.680]   - Great, you don't know how long you've been married either.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   So Jenny is the leader of really a movement,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.760]   If Gathering, where really for almost 10 years now,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.280]   she has led a generation of women.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.720]   Truly millions of people around the world
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.040]   have sat under Jenny's leadership
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.280]   as she has provided resources and conferences
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   that have helped disciple a generation of women.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.600]   And I know that many of you have been impacted
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.960]   by her leadership.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.640]   I am one of those people.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.000]   I am not a woman, but I've still been impacted.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.040]   - Thank you for that clarity.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.880]   - Yes.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.480]   More than that, I'm so thankful for Jenny's friendship.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.640]   Her husband and her have just been a lifeline
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.480]   for my wife and I as we've moved to Dallas.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.560]   And she is the real deal.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.360]   Like what you see on the stage,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.960]   that is who she is in a living room.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.720]   And so thanks so much for jumping in tonight.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.560]   I'm glad you're here. - Great to be here.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.440]   - Jenny, I know that you have a huge heart
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   for the young adults that are sitting in this room.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.000]   And honestly, the young adults around the world.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.160]   So I want them to hear your heart for them
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.600]   before we even jump in.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.200]   What do you wanna share?
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   - Yeah, I feel uniquely drawn to you guys.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.360]   And I think one of the reasons
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.840]   is you have been incredibly zealous for God.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   There hasn't really been a lot of medium people
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.080]   I have met under the age of 28, 29.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.640]   And I know some of you are above it.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.480]   You can be medium.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.960]   But most of the people I've met under 28, 29
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   have just either not wanted God or they want God.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.480]   And so just the fact that on a Tuesday night
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.440]   there are this many of you here as young adults.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.480]   I know some of you are here to meet cute boys or girls
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.320]   and that's great.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.200]   I highly recommend that pursuit.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.400]   But I more highly know that there's a part of you
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.640]   that has a desire for God.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.120]   Even those of you that maybe stumbled in the door
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.040]   and don't know God, there's a desire.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.200]   And I think that desire comes from desperation.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.360]   And that's the other reason my heart goes out to you
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.600]   is I see, just like you talked about last week, TA,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.120]   I mean, it was so important and relevant
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.400]   for you to talk about that.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   That is tragic that that is relevant.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.120]   That is tragic that the percentage that I saw
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.960]   that you shared.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.600]   You're desperate.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.040]   And yes, that's scary.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.080]   And yes, there's some challenges that come with that.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.720]   But when you're desperate,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.880]   God starts looking really dear and really good.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.560]   And I believe when you're desperate,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.920]   God starts getting very real.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.120]   And you crave Him and you want Him in a different way.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.080]   So that's what I've seen as I've worked with
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.920]   a lot of y'all in the past.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.760]   - That's great.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   Well, so we're talking about prayer tonight.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.000]   And I know that you are a woman who prays.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.840]   You're a praying woman.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.800]   So I would just love to know, talk us through,
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.920]   what is your journey with prayer look like over the years?
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.160]   Like what have been the shaping forces in your life?
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.760]   Who and what has cultivated your prayer life?
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.200]   - So how many of y'all keep a journal?
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.120]   A lot of you, good.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.440]   Then you probably are praying in that journal.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.280]   And I did that a lot of my life.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.900]   I currently don't do that any longer.
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.780]   They are called books in my life now.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.520]   They're my journals that are published
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.120]   for a lot of people to read.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.880]   And for years I kept journals.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.180]   And at the beginning of, I would look back at my journals
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.120]   and at the beginning of all my journals as a young adult,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.920]   it would always start with, I'm so sorry.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.980]   Like that was the first line of every page
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.160]   when I would go back and look at it.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.400]   And it would be because days would have gone by
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.120]   or possibly even weeks would have gone by
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.280]   and I hadn't quote met with God.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.640]   And so I would say for a long time, I hated this subject
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.560]   because I always felt like I was failing in this subject.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.080]   I felt like there was a mark and I wasn't hitting it.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.680]   And therefore every time I came into God's presence,
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.140]   apparently in my journal, I felt guilty and I felt ashamed.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.800]   And that's how I started every minute
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   that I would begin to pray with God.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.960]   - I totally resonate with that.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.480]   Like I just said, I minored in prayers.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.080]   So that guilt that you felt, like I can totally,
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.880]   I can look back and I'm like, I feel that.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.560]   So if you and I have felt it, I would imagine that,
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.600]   I don't know if you've, anyone honest enough to say,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.960]   yeah, I've felt that guilt before.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah, a lot of people.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   - Which let's go into that for a minute.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.720]   Because I'm really good at hijacking interviews.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.920]   I'm gonna warranty it.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   Is this the first time you've interviewed me?
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.060]   - It is. - Watch out, let's go.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.600]   - Might be the last.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.000]   I don't know, I don't know, we'll see, we'll see.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.720]   - See where we're gonna go.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.280]   So what I, here's what I wanna say about that,
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.480]   is how miserable to get in anybody's presence
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.200]   you feel guilty with.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.680]   Like you don't want, you don't desire to go in.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.880]   If you have a difficult relationship with your dad,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.800]   if you think about that relationship,
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.720]   and you feel like whenever you're around him,
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.040]   he's being critical or you feel like he's,
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.760]   he's disappointed in you,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.720]   you probably don't see your dad a lot.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.540]   You probably don't pick up the phone and call him a lot.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.240]   You probably don't wanna be with him.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.360]   That's just human nature.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:37.160]   So let me just give you kind of a little compassion for,
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   that that many of you raised your hands
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.440]   and said that you feel guilty about your prayer life,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.400]   that you feel guilty with God.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.320]   That's really hard,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.700]   because that then is not the person that you wanna go to.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.480]   And I would say, looking back,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.080]   at that time in my life,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.600]   I didn't go to God a lot.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.240]   The reason I was usually apologizing
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.080]   is because a week or weeks had gone by
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.000]   and I hadn't even talked to him.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.400]   My prayer life, I'll fast forward,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.000]   and then we'll fill in more.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.080]   My prayer life now,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.680]   and this is what I'm gonna advocate for you,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.440]   it is completely different than journaling.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.800]   And I'm not saying you shouldn't journal,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.440]   and I'm not saying you shouldn't spend
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.340]   concentrated time in prayer,
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.440]   but my prayer life is constant.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.080]   It is very rarely me on my knees for an hour.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.600]   It is most often as I am going
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.320]   every minute throughout the day.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.160]   Why?
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.920]   Because I really like God.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.560]   I really like him.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.720]   And I feel like he's with me all the time.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.760]   And I also feel like I am missing
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.920]   99% of what is happening around me,
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.880]   if I am not asking him what is happening around me.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.520]   And so there is just a constant,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.660]   Lord, what do you want me to do here?
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.840]   What do you want me to say here?
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.640]   God, what do you want me to know
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.300]   about what was just said to me?
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.440]   How do you want me to react here?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.720]   There is a constant conversation with God
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.440]   going through my mind all the time.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.760]   Now, here's the thing about living that way,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.240]   is it's just a little crazy.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.760]   Like, it really is.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.840]   If you really pray without ceasing,
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.560]   if you really are just God constantly,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.240]   I'm with you, I know you're here,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.720]   what do you want me to know?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.400]   You are going through life a little bit,
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.360]   either talking to yourself
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.000]   or talking to somebody invisible.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.440]   Now, I say that it should be obvious,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   but some of y'all just went like, yeah,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   I hadn't thought about that.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.320]   I say that because I think as Christians,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.380]   we don't talk enough about how absolutely crazy we are.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.760]   Like how odd all of this is.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.920]   Like, I hate talking about prayer and I rarely do it.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.520]   One of the reasons I don't do it
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.200]   is because of the verse that says,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   don't be like the hypocrites that stand up and pray,
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.000]   but also I think talk about prayer.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.660]   Like, just don't be someone that goes boasting about it
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.260]   or talking about it, like just do it.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.280]   That's kind of what his point was.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.400]   So I don't know that I've ever even talked about prayer
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.080]   really in this deep of a way.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:07.900]   That's one reason.
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   The other reason is because there is nothing worse to me
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.760]   than thinking that prayer is boring
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.360]   or that prayer has to be done a certain way
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.440]   or that there is a script for prayer or that this,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.320]   now granted, Jesus said, this is how you pray.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.440]   There is just a short little script,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.080]   but I think the point of the script that he gave
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.440]   was to give direction and to show the things
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.320]   that we are to bring to him, which is everything.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.800]   It's to wrestle out life with him.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.560]   It is the sin that we're carrying
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.600]   and the sin of other people.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.000]   He built a model of just bring it all, bring it all.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.720]   Bring what you need, bring what you want,
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.280]   bring what you're struggling with, bring it all.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.000]   That's the Lord's prayer.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.120]   We can put it up in a minute.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.120]   But outside of that, it's supposed to be a relationship.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.520]   And for so long, I believe we've set prayer
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.440]   as this thing that we're all supposed to do.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.520]   And I remember I was with a girl once
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.300]   and she was going through so much.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.120]   And honestly, she was a girl that I was discipling.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.180]   And so we met a lot.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.440]   We met every week or so.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.760]   And it was just kind of the same story every week,
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.800]   like the same struggles every single week.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.360]   And so I would ask her every week,
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   are you praying about this?
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.760]   And she would say, yes, I'm praying about it.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.120]   And finally, I said this instead.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   I said, are you forming words to God about this?
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.080]   She stopped.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.520]   She was like, no.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.520]   So whatever her definition of prayer was,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.000]   probably was more like worry.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.660]   It probably was more like stewing and thinking,
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.920]   but it probably wasn't prayer.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.760]   And so my hope tonight is,
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.320]   and we're gonna go into this a little deeper,
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.200]   but my hope tonight is you leave tonight
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.520]   and you are running to your car to talk to him
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.800]   because you're free again,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.940]   'cause you're not so burdened and bogged down
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.280]   by the way your relationship has been.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.320]   See, prayer is just talking to God.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.360]   That's all it is.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.080]   And so it's not about prayer.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.100]   It's about your relationship with God.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.600]   It's how safe are you with him?
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.800]   How much do you want to share what just happened with him?
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.000]   How much do you wanna talk to him?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.200]   That's, how much do you need him?
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.380]   In fact, that's probably the most common time I pray,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.880]   is when I experienced that.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.800]   - Yeah.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   So one of the things that you said,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.440]   and I can't remember exactly how you said it,
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.960]   but it's hard to be in the presence of someone
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.480]   you feel guilty being with.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.680]   But now I hear you saying you really like God.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.160]   - I do. - So if you're gonna spend,
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.840]   if you're gonna talk to him constantly,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.860]   like you're gonna have to really like him.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.900]   So one of the things a common friend of ours,
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.520]   Doug Sherman, said to me once,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.680]   and I've shared it here before,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.840]   but he said, "Your view of God
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.480]   "determines your response to God."
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   So you cannot, if you don't have the right view of God,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.120]   it's gonna be really hard to talk to him constantly.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.360]   And so I think that's why Jesus tells us
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.840]   in the Lord's Prayer, how do we start our Father?
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.840]   You have to have a view of God as Father
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.920]   that is someone that you wanna draw near to regularly.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   So I'd love to just hear, what is your view of God?
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.000]   Just unpack that.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.100]   When you think about, when you say, "I really like him."
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.820]   - Okay.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.000]   - This question is not on here.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.960]   - Let's go.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.480]   I'm gonna pull up a verse.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.400]   I think the problem with us in prayer
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.840]   is that we don't believe God.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.640]   And we're missing the fact
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.280]   that this is supposed to be a supernatural exchange
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.320]   about supernatural things that are happening all around us.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.080]   And because we look at the natural
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   and we look at each other
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.640]   and we look at the problems that we're facing
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.240]   and we look at the lack of our lives
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.960]   and we look at what we don't have that we wish we had,
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.120]   because we're looking at the natural,
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.680]   we miss the whole purpose of prayer,
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   that it is supposed to be about things that are wholly other
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.700]   that we can't even imagine
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.600]   that are happening all around us all the time.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.800]   And this makes me think of Luke.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.760]   In Luke 10, Jesus has sent out the disciples
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.660]   for the first time and he's said,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.680]   "Hey, I want you to go and I want you to heal
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.540]   "and I want you to preach
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.540]   "and I want you to do this in pairs
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.400]   "around everywhere and here's how I want you to do it."
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.080]   And it's a fascinating passage
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.040]   because he goes into basically discipleship,
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.000]   this is how you're gonna go out and do the mission of God.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.480]   This is how you're gonna go out and do my work.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.160]   He's preparing them and they come back
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.560]   and this is what they say.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.600]   There were 72 of them and they returned with joy saying,
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.800]   "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name."
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.200]   And he said to them,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.140]   "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.840]   "Behold, I have given you authority
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.100]   "to tread on serpents and scorpions
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.500]   "and over all the power of the enemy
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.480]   "and nothing shall hurt you."
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.820]   That is the power that you have with God.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.000]   The reason you don't pray is you don't believe
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.260]   that powerful things can happen through you and around you.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.540]   You're bored, you're bored with God.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.460]   We get bored with what he thinks he has for us
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.980]   and what he wants from us.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.440]   And so we miss the super,
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.080]   we miss all of the exciting stuff
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.680]   that actually could be happening
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.120]   if we would just say, "Hey God,
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.820]   "what do you want me to make of this?
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.780]   "What are you doing here?
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.780]   "How do I enter this situation?"
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.640]   And let me tell you how it works, the exchange.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.700]   It is not what you think.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.560]   It's things like turning the other cheek
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.720]   instead of having the last word.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.400]   It's these ways that are so mysterious
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.800]   but yet through those ways, God changes the world.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.760]   But because we don't believe that prayer changes anything,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.880]   doesn't change us, it doesn't change the world,
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.220]   all of it's hopeless,
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.840]   then we don't ask for anything to change.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.560]   And so we live bored and stuck and apathetic
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.680]   and we don't know why.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.380]   And I guess I wanna get to the heart of why we don't pray
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:31.380]   because I think that if you did pray, you'd love praying
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.160]   and it wouldn't be a problem
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.000]   because you'd watch God move around you.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.080]   I mean, that's me.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.160]   When I was thinking on the way here,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.200]   I was like, how do I even put into words
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.080]   how I view God and why I love prayer?
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.560]   Because it's the most exciting thing in the world
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.440]   to work with God.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.320]   It changes every conversation.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.480]   It changes every room.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.520]   It changes every assignment that God has put in your life.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.400]   It changes absolutely everything.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.000]   And so all of a sudden, what was completely mundane
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.560]   is the most exciting thing in the world
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.680]   because now you are working with God for eternal purposes
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.360]   in the midst of the Monday.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.200]   - That's great.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.680]   - And so when you start asking Him to show up,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.360]   to asking Him to move, asking Him to help your friend,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.680]   He starts moving, helping, showing up.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.840]   Amazing.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.880]   Now it doesn't always feel like you thought it would
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.440]   because He, hey, I've got another verse for this.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.000]   It's real simple and it's horrible.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.680]   Isaiah 55, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.400]   "neither are your ways my ways," declares the Lord.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.240]   Dang it.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.440]   It just doesn't fit in our box.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.200]   It doesn't go how we want it to go.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.280]   And so when you let go of how you want it to go,
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.120]   which is called surrender,
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.040]   when you let go of that and you start to pray,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.360]   those two things together,
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.000]   you will start to see what I'm talking about.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.160]   You will start to watch the Holy Spirit move and lead
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.640]   and do things that you never saw coming.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.200]   And life goes from very apathetic and boring
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.480]   to mind-blowingly crazy awesome.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.000]   And no, not every minute of every day, but kind of.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.520]   And even suffering, like I think about suffering
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.280]   because that's another reason I think people don't pray.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.440]   I feel like y'all should tell me why you don't pray.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.760]   Will y'all tell me?
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.600]   Just yell it out.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.720]   What's the barrier?
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.600]   We all have one.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.520]   What's the barrier?
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.840]   Good, shame, pride, busy, doubt, doing it wrong.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.680]   Doing it wrong, apathy, sin.
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.800]   What sin?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.640]   Just kidding.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.480]   Different talk.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.720]   Frustration, why frustration?
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   Where are you, buddy?
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.200]   Let's give this guy a mic.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.040]   Yeah, come here.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.120]   Yep.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.600]   Where's our microphone over here?
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.200]   Let's make this thing real.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.080]   Here you go.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:20:59.920]   What's your name?
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.720]   I didn't think this was.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.560]   Is this on?
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.520]   Bro, you have so much power right now, it's crazy.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.720]   I feel like I have the infinity goblet on me.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.400]   So I'm kind of in a season currently
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.800]   where God's literally stripping down all the idols
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.840]   in my life, wow, my heart's palpitating right now,
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.920]   where he took my job, my car, everything that I found
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.040]   my value in and my identity in, and he literally said,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.800]   "I have all you have left."
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.440]   And I'm actually going into a mission trip
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.000]   in this upcoming week, and I'm literally saying,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.200]   "God, use me as you wish, I have nothing else but you.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.800]   "Here's my heart, use it as an undivided vessel."
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.320]   And so it's frustrating because some days are mundane,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.960]   and not every day is a rollercoaster of emotions,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.840]   there's ups and downs, and I kind of always wish
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.320]   that I was just on the top of a mountain,
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.440]   like with Moses in Mount Sinai, just in the presence of God,
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.920]   just captivated in his presence.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.800]   But it's not always like that, so it's frustrating
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.960]   because you're kind of going through this, again,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.240]   this rollercoaster, and it's, I mean,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.480]   now I'm just repeating myself, but it's frustrating.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.720]   All right, what's your name?
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.560]   Josh.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.760]   Josh.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.640]   Thanks for being so honest, that was amazing.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.480]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.640]   (audience applauding)
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:33.200]   But we're not done.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.680]   So you just said something profound
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.360]   that I think all of us here feel.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.240]   Didn't a lot of people relate to what he was saying?
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.280]   It just feels frustrating, it feels like
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.520]   you've taken things from me, I would pray,
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.480]   but I may not get it back, and how do I do
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.600]   in a relationship where I'm asking you for things
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.200]   I need, that I want, that it's not going at all
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.840]   how I want it to go, right?
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.080]   Yeah, I'm also praying for relationships,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.920]   so God, hold on.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.520]   It's been a long time, it's been a long time.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   I like, some girl is going bee-lying.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.880]   Yeah, it all starts tonight.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.960]   God knows why he led me here, so.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.440]   So, that prayer's gonna get answered.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.280]   Just kidding.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.440]   So, here's what I would say, is there's a part of you,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:34.080]   there's a part of you that trusts God and loves him.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.360]   That's why you're going on a mission trip,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.640]   that's why you're here, that's why you're still in.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.160]   And then there's another part of you that what?
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.160]   Feels?
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.000]   Just full of hope, I mean.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.880]   No, the bad part.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.720]   Oh, the bad part.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.880]   Frustrated, yeah.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.760]   I want you to even, are you mad?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.320]   I'd be mad.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:04.120]   Yeah, oftentimes, yeah, I mean, I literally shake my head,
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.720]   like my fist at God and say, like, why?
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.960]   This is so unjust, I'm not a perfect person,
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.440]   but like, why are you taking everything from me?
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.920]   And then, the more I just came to the presence of God,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.160]   I realized, like, I have no room to say anything.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.000]   Wait, wait, no, no.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.840]   Why do I have the audacity?
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040]   See, you're moving to the other part really fast.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.560]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.880]   I was loving the first part.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.600]   I want you to keep going on the anger,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.920]   because that's real.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:32.240]   And I think we are afraid to say that to God.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.320]   And the reason we're ashamed is because we feel it,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.600]   but we don't think we can say it.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.440]   You don't think I can shake my hand at God
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.640]   and still trust Him and still be a godly person.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.280]   Like, how quick were you to go,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.800]   but I know I don't deserve anything.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.200]   I mean, we all have the but, da, da, da, da, da.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.360]   Y'all, the but's true, right?
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.440]   The but is, it's not that the but's wrong.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.800]   It's that we are comfortable sitting in the anger,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.360]   and God is perfectly comfortable
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.000]   sitting with you and your anger.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.840]   That's good.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.920]   He's perfectly comfortable.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.760]   Yep.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.000]   He's not mad back.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.440]   He's not sad.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.880]   You know what He loves?
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.120]   The same thing I love when my kid opens up to me
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.480]   and gets in the car and is raging mad
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.240]   because I'm not gonna let him do the thing he wants me to do,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.320]   and he's mad at me about it, and he's telling me why.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.520]   And he's saying, "You know what I wanted today, Mom?
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.640]   "I just wanted to see my girlfriend at the YMCA.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.640]   "That's what I wanted.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.480]   "You're in my way."
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.400]   Buddy, you know what?
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.720]   That is, of course you do.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.400]   Of course you do.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.120]   But you really might go kiss her somewhere in that YMCA,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:46.960]   so you're not going.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.800]   But--
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.120]   But of course you wanna go,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.360]   and of course you're mad at me
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.600]   who's in between the thing that you want.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.120]   And I get it.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.440]   And I think as parents, so often we have had parents
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.600]   that have made us feel bad for the things that we feel,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.080]   rather than say, "You know what?
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.040]   "This is really hard.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.400]   "This is not how it should be, and I'm sorry,
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.800]   "and I love you."
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.960]   And we can sit here, and you can shake your fist,
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.840]   'cause you're right, I have all the power, and you don't.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.880]   And it just is the safest place we could be,
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.720]   because he can handle it.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:40.480]   And I'm not just saying that because I've experienced that.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.120]   The Bible is clear.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.600]   David was a man after God's own heart,
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.440]   and he brought it all.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.600]   Okay, you can, you were amazing.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.120]   I'm so glad for you.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:50.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.800]   - Thank you.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.840]   - You're crazy if y'all don't just go up and say hey
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.800]   tonight, you girls, just say hey.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.160]   So yeah, I just think it's complicated.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.600]   I think we are more complicated than we want to admit,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.240]   and we think being godly is saying all the right things
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.880]   and doing all the right things, but being godly,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.320]   a man after God's own heart, is being near and with God.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.400]   And that is a very different kind of relationship
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   than thank you God for everything, even though it all sucks.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.720]   Sorry if that's a cuss word to you.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   Sometimes, let's just be real,
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.360]   I could've used a way worse one.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.520]   Hey, that was me today.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.360]   - Yeah.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.960]   - Like I was, we had a really tough day in our household.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.440]   Like there was something my wife and I,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.120]   we were praying for for one of our kids,
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.720]   and it didn't happen, and the words out of my mouth
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.120]   to my wife today, standing in the kitchen,
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.720]   where I do not know why God did not answer it,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   it would've been so easy for him to just do it.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.840]   And I was frustrated.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.840]   And then, in the same day, I'm thinking,
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:16.040]   Psalm 34, I will exalt the Lord at all times.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.760]   His praise will continually be in my mouth.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.320]   Like I can hold that tension, that I'm frustrated,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.260]   and he is still good, and he's worthy of praise.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.720]   And it feels real, like it would be inauthentic
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   for me to get up here and not battle that frustration.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.960]   I don't know where we picked up
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.460]   that we have to be one thing.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.160]   We can be a lot of things.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.000]   We can be sad and grateful at the same time.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.080]   We can be disappointed and happy
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.880]   about a lot of parts of our life at the same time.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.480]   And God knows that, he built us that way.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.640]   But we do tend to think, we are working so hard.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.640]   There's a part of our minds that is working so hard
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.440]   to not feel the things we shouldn't feel.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.400]   It's judging all of the anger, all of the frustration,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.080]   all of the pride, all of the things.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.280]   That part of your brain, it's an overdrive.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.200]   It's just, you shouldn't think that.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.560]   You shouldn't feel that.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.080]   Should my son want to go kiss the girl at the YMCA?
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.700]   I don't know, but you know what?
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.880]   It's not the worst thing in the world.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.360]   And I'm sure not gonna shame him about it.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.360]   Yeah, he's got desires that a little middle school boy has.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.440]   God help him and all of you.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.160]   But as a mom, and I'm using this as an example
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.520]   for everything, as a mom, I can either go,
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.160]   you shouldn't do that.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.400]   You shouldn't want that.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.040]   You shouldn't feel that.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.340]   Or I can go, of course you feel that way.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.600]   Of course you feel that way.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.640]   We're still gonna do what's right.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.680]   But not kiss the girl.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.440]   But, he's 14, y'all can kiss.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.760]   Don't even get me started.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.600]   If you--
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.680]   - So we're talking about prayer tonight.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.040]   That's a whole 'nother series, Jenny.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.160]   Come back for it.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.480]   - Yes.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.780]   New question.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:24.880]   I just disqualified myself from that series.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.180]   - No, you're coming, well.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.080]   Anyway, so.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.640]   - I have a verse.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.000]   - That's good, let's roll the verse.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.240]   - Yeah, I mean, y'all hear what I'm saying.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.040]   I just think we're playing games.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.520]   And that's what I think is exhausting for you.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.400]   God's okay.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.240]   You know what?
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   God is even compassionate with your games you're playing
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.360]   about prayer.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.240]   You know what he does?
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.920]   This is so cute.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   You're sitting there ashamed so you don't go to him.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.960]   And you know what he does?
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.120]   Dang it.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.640]   Not 'cause he's mad or disappointed, 'cause he likes you.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.680]   And he has plans for you.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.440]   And he wants to walk with you in your day.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.440]   And he wants to help you with what you're dealing with.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.200]   And he wants to be in it with you.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.380]   It's a dang it, like, I would feel
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.860]   if my kids never told me anything, right?
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.400]   It's, I wanna be in the mess with you.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.080]   Am I ever, sometimes as a human, I might judge it.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.240]   And your dad might have,
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.200]   and that is how you are viewing God.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.080]   But our God says, I want to be in it with you.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.920]   Because we think we have to make ourselves right before God
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.800]   and we don't understand the doctrine of sanctification.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   And some of you are going,
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   I don't even know if I believe in God.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.320]   Let's more or less, let's talk about big words like that.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.280]   But it's an important thing to believe
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.500]   because the doctrine of sanctification is believing
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.880]   that not only does God draw you to himself to know him,
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.540]   but he also changes your life as you go.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.980]   And if you believe that,
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.560]   then walking with him is the way it happens.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.360]   So when it's broken, you go to him.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.880]   When you're sad, you go to him.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.440]   When you're mad, you go to him.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.440]   When you're mad at him, you go to him.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.760]   Like that's how it's supposed to go.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.440]   And as you go with him, the more he gives you insight,
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.520]   he gives you vision, he gives you perspective,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.800]   he gives you hope, he gives you self-control,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.000]   he gives you joy, he gives you friends,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.240]   he gives you community,
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.720]   he gives you people to make you better.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.920]   He gives you more of his word and reminds you of it.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.860]   That is how it goes, but it doesn't go that way
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.700]   if you don't go to him.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.720]   - Yeah, that's good.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.800]   - If you don't form words to him.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.840]   - So Jenny, you were talking about your own prayer life
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.000]   and you just said, "I'm praying constantly."
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.560]   - Yeah. - Okay, that's biblical.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.920]   That's 1 Thessalonians 5, which says,
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.100]   "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing,
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.600]   "in everything give thanks."
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.440]   Why?
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.980]   "For this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.620]   So to pray without ceasing,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.240]   the verse would say, "Is God's will for you."
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.880]   So help us get there.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.880]   Like, how do we take steps with that?
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:59.080]   - I kinda wanna do another analogy with someone
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.640]   because I think this is, it's so much more easily worked out
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.800]   if, so somebody just volunteer.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.680]   Okay, you.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.120]   We have a microphone for you.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.640]   Okay, what's your name?
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.480]   Paige.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.680]   Let's work this out together because I think sometimes
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.640]   me just telling you the answer is,
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.040]   you'll forget it, but I bet everyone will remember you, Paige.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.440]   Okay, so Paige, stand up.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.280]   - Okay.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.360]   - When's the last time you talked to God
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.200]   and you gotta be honest.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.560]   I'm trusting like you have a sweet face,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.400]   you're gonna be honest.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.000]   - Okay, probably like this morning.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.720]   - Okay, what'd you say?
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.760]   - I would just say, I always say
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.560]   I'm how grateful I am every morning
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.880]   and I list like what exactly I'm grateful for.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.360]   - Good, awesome.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.880]   So since then, today, what's happened in your life?
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.840]   - Work, just at home, gym.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.520]   - Was there anything bad that happened today?
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.240]   - My dogs annoyed me.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.000]   - Your dogs annoyed you, that's a good day.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.840]   - Yeah, but it's a good day.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.400]   - I'm gonna call that, it's probably--
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.360]   - Everything was good, yeah.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.640]   - Great day, okay.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.720]   So you weren't frustrated with anybody?
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.200]   Bored?
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.960]   - No.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.560]   - You are really happy and grateful.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.640]   Sit down, you're out.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.360]   Okay, I see the hat right there.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.120]   Yes, you're up.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.040]   I'm trusting you see where this is going
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.840]   and you are gonna be a troubled soul.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.400]   Hey, do not miss what just happened with Paige.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   What does Paige do every morning?
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.960]   And how does she pray?
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.840]   With gratitude.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:39.040]   And the biggest frustration of her day was her dog.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.800]   And I'm not saying that's every day, Paige,
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.520]   'cause I'm quite sure you have had bigger problems
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.840]   in the last few months.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.320]   But life sure does feel a lot more manageable and doable,
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.040]   whatever frustrations probably were in your life today,
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.400]   if we are grateful.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.440]   Okay, what's your name?
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.640]   - My name's Elvis.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.480]   - Elvis?
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.320]   - Like Presley, yes ma'am.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.160]   - Nice.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.000]   Okay, Elvis.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.560]   So when's the last time you talked to God?
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.040]   You're wearing a cross, it was probably recently.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.720]   - It was this morning.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.840]   I actually drove from college this morning to be here.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.680]   - Awesome.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.520]   (audience cheering)
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.360]   What college?
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.920]   - Texas A&M International University.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.280]   It's about seven hours south in Laredo.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.120]   - Awesome.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:17.960]   (audience cheering)
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.800]   - So yeah, I pray I got up at 5.45 this morning.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.280]   I'm like, God, just give me a safe journey, make it smooth.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.600]   Hopefully I don't get mad at traffic
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.840]   and hopefully we can make it on time, and I did.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   - And you did it.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.480]   Okay, so I want you to describe just in general
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.040]   how your prayer life goes.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.280]   - A lot of times I tend to get frustrated and lost.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.320]   There have been a lot of instances in my life
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.880]   where I've been scared, dealt with a lot of illness,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.580]   not with just me, with my family.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.120]   And a lot of times I also feel frustrated
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.440]   I don't find a solution for things like that,
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.040]   that it leads me on a weird journey
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.560]   and it never ends up how I want.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.960]   And that tends to frustrate me because, I mean,
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.440]   obviously, a lot of times I wanna be in control,
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.480]   and when it's out of my control,
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:04.600]   it scares me and freaks me out.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.880]   - Play along with me here.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   - Okay.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.720]   - Why?
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.680]   - I like to be in control of my life and my situations.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.480]   - Why are you scared?
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.440]   - 'Cause I don't want it to end up bad.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.600]   - You don't want it to end up bad?
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.440]   - Right.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.280]   - Why?
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.640]   - Deep questions.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.120]   That's a hard one to answer, 'cause I want it to go my way.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.200]   I don't want it to end up bad
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.760]   because I want the best for myself.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.600]   And if I don't feel that--
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.320]   - So what happens if it all goes bad?
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.840]   It's gone bad for you already.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.920]   - You said it, not me.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.760]   - Nope, nope.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.560]   You are very right, you are very right.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.200]   So, dang, that's a good question.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.880]   It's just, I feel like whenever it goes bad,
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.600]   I get pulled away from God.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.680]   - It pulls you away from God?
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.520]   - Right.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   - Why?
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.920]   - 'Cause I feel like whenever I'm not at my best,
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.840]   I feel like I'm not closest with God.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.880]   Like, I've had a situation with ex-girlfriends
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.200]   where I feel like I've made some poor decisions
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.700]   and it's pulled me away from God.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.760]   And I pray, like, God, please let this not go bad.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.840]   Never does.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.880]   And so I'm like, God, let this go smooth.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.240]   Let us both be happy.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   And a lot of times it doesn't end up that way
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.480]   and I don't like that.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.840]   - Okay, so to your question, I'm gonna let you sit down.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.320]   That was actually super helpful.
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.640]   Because I think hearing how other people pray
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.480]   and what they struggle with is so interesting
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.320]   because we all are struggling with this.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.440]   Why?
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.680]   What I said about the devil,
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.340]   if we have all the authority and power
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.060]   and all of that authority and power
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.580]   is accessed through a relationship with God,
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.120]   which means through prayer,
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.600]   then the enemy hates prayer.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.440]   The enemy hates it.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.720]   He wants us to not be in relationship with God.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.480]   He wants to destroy, kill our relationship with God.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.800]   And so if that is what you feel
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.340]   every time that you go through suffering,
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.600]   is that you get further from God,
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.800]   that you fall away from God,
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.140]   then you're going to dread it.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.480]   You're gonna feel like I will be alone,
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.960]   I will be isolated, I will be abandoned,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.480]   and I'm gonna have to deal with this myself
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.680]   and I'm gonna have to fix this.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.720]   But that's not a true narrative.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.080]   You know that.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:17.900]   You know the narrative.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:18.740]   The narrative is Romans.
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.160]   The narrative is that blessed are those who suffer.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.200]   Blessed are those who mourn.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   The narrative is that when we suffer,
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.340]   we actually are building hope
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.240]   and hope is building all of these other
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.320]   beautiful things in our life.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.880]   And so we want, in a weird way, to suffer.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.060]   So we're not really so afraid of it.
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.000]   It's just, we're afraid of being abandoned and left in it.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.400]   And God says, "I'll draw nearer to you in it.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.680]   I will walk closer in the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.640]   And so don't fear anything because I will do it with you."
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.640]   But the way we access Him is to talk to Him
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:54.480]   and to not miss it.
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.720]   And so to your question, how do you do this right now?
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.400]   How do y'all go out of here and just talk to Him?
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.480]   It is as messy as it sounds.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.320]   It is as messy as it sounds.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.560]   I think you say on the way out,
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.800]   "God, I don't know how to do this.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.940]   Will you help me know how to do this?"
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.120]   And then when you get in the car, you go,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.040]   "Okay, God, I'm going home and I'm gonna be tempted
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.380]   by blank, help me with it."
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.140]   Or God, you get in the car and say,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.280]   "God, I am so disappointed in you
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.040]   and that is why I'm not talking to you.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.640]   And I need you to change the way I feel about you."
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:29.360]   Or, "God, my parent that is so horrible to me,
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.080]   I'm supposed to love them and I can't
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.420]   and I need you to help me.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.820]   It is Mother's Day and I don't know what to do."
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:42.480]   Instead of just and only, "Thank you, God, keep me safe."
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:50.440]   All the messy parts, all the hard parts, He is waiting.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.680]   He is waiting like I am in my car when I pick up my kid.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.200]   I am waiting for the messy parts.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.040]   Why?
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   Because I can help with the messy parts.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.460]   I may not give Him the answer that He wants,
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.360]   but I will be in it with Him.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.660]   And we will go get Chick-fil-A instead of go to the Y.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.660]   'Cause I like it.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:13.320]   - That's great.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.440]   Do you hear from God?
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.080]   - Yeah.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.960]   Gonna get in trouble.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.940]   Yes, I hear from God, but it's not like you think.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:25.780]   It's not a voice.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:28.480]   I just know, I ask Him, "What do you want me to do here?"
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.320]   And I know what to do.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.560]   And back to your fear,
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.080]   if you give up control of your life, this is the key, guys.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.160]   If you say, "You know what?
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.060]   "If I never get married,
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:45.060]   "if I never ever get to do something important that matters,
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.920]   "if I never get to be in right relationship
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.760]   "with my parents again,
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.580]   "if I never get to that job that I am aspiring to,
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:56.020]   "if I never get in that school that I want, I'm okay.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.080]   "I want you and I want what you have for me
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.200]   "and when you live that,
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   "when that is a sincere desire of your heart
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.700]   "and it takes prayer to get there,
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.800]   "it takes God helping us move to that,
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   "then what happens next is, yes, God starts speaking,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   "but He doesn't compete.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.480]   "He doesn't compete.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.060]   "When you don't know what to do, start with God.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.360]   "Is there anything that I love more than you?"
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:28.240]   And if there is, you confess it and let go of it
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.600]   and say, "God, here it is.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.300]   "I'll probably have to give it to you again next hour,
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.800]   "but here it is."
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.680]   And then He gets loud.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.160]   And I don't mean His voice, I just mean His direction.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.440]   You know what to do, you know what to say,
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.960]   you know how to fight your sin, you know who to tell,
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.060]   you know, you know, you know.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.480]   And you don't know perfectly,
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.920]   it's always kind of just a,
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.880]   I think this is what God wants,
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.400]   but there's a lot of confidence that comes
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.160]   as you surrender and He knows that you're gonna obey.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.660]   God loves to speak to people that are gonna obey.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.200]   - Jenny, I'm putting you on the spot,
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.280]   but before I ever knew you,
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.480]   I don't know if I was reading your book, "Nothing to Prove,"
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.960]   or it was something that I heard you say at some point,
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:18.480]   but you were talking about a prayer that you and Zach prayed
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.360]   that really led to where you are now.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.920]   And I just feel like that prayer needs to be shared.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.280]   - Yeah.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.960]   So we were, we had young kids
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.600]   and he was a pastor at the time,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.240]   and we were reading the blog of a girl named Katie Davis
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   who lived in Africa and she was a little younger than me
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.600]   and had adopted multiple kids off the streets of Uganda
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.640]   and left her kind of suburban Nashville life
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.740]   and surrendered to God
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.800]   and was living in a really radical way.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.720]   And I read her words and I read her blog
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.680]   and I just wanted what she had.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.640]   I wanted to follow God like that.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.240]   I wanted to surrender to God like that.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.360]   And so I remember that night,
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:08.000]   I stayed up till like one AM reading her blog
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.840]   on my bathroom floor
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.720]   'cause I didn't wanna keep Zach up.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   And I just remember turning over on my cold bathroom floor
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.840]   and saying, "Lord, I will do anything you want.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.440]   We will do anything you want."
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.160]   And immediately clear idols came to mind
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.160]   of I had largely held back from the things
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.000]   that I knew God wanted me to do,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.240]   the gifts that I knew he wanted me to use
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.040]   because I cared a lot what people thought.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.680]   That was the first thing that was really clear to me.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.120]   That I believe God made clear to me that night.
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.040]   And there were several others.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.880]   I loved comfort.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:42.700]   I loved approval.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.960]   I love all the things we all love, right?
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.880]   I loved it all and I wanted it more
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.160]   and I had been living for it.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.320]   And when God brought to mind things I should do
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.680]   or things that he wanted for me,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.080]   I would push it away out of approval or comfort or control.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.560]   And so we just begin to pray,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.560]   "God, we want you more than comfort
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.000]   and control and approval."
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.800]   And what's awful and wonderful
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:10.000]   is we lost a lot of those things when we prayed that prayer.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.660]   We've lost all of those things almost every day of our lives
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.760]   because we pray that prayer consistently
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.920]   and we still pray that prayer
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.600]   and we keep losing those things.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.780]   And it's the best life you could possibly imagine.
[00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.900]   You don't really want those things.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.200]   They don't build incredible lives.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.900]   They don't build lives that will matter for eternity.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   They build comfortable, approved of, in control lives.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.800]   And do you want that?
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.040]   You just have to choose.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.240]   Like that's your choice.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.120]   Every one of us gets to choose.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:49.080]   Do you want a comfortable, in control life full of approval?
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.760]   Or do you want to follow God?
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.880]   And when you want to follow God and you say,
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   "I will let go of those things,"
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.640]   you will lose those things.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.740]   You'll lose them all.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.160]   And it's, I highly recommend it.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.400]   The hardest parts of my life that have come from that prayer
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.680]   are the best parts of my life.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.880]   It's that little 14 year old boy from Rwanda
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.680]   that I'm trying to help not kiss too many girls
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.460]   and he's going to kill me that I put this all out
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.300]   on the internet.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.920]   But--
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.760]   - Hi Cooper.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.960]   - He's actually going to be like,
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.200]   "Yeah, a girl wants to kiss me.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.600]   That's my story."
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:33.920]   So yeah, I mean, the hardest parts are the best parts,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.160]   but the way we get there is surrender.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.680]   And so, yeah, we prayed that prayer
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.280]   and there have been days just really candidly
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.180]   because of the things God has brought into our life
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.420]   because of that surrender that I have,
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.520]   I've wanted a different way.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.560]   I've wanted the control back.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.560]   I've wanted the approval back, but I would not trade it.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.680]   I wouldn't trade it.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.360]   - Jenny, will you finish just by sharing the gospel
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.840]   with our friends tonight?
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.680]   - Yeah, I mean, I feel especially tender
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.040]   to any of you that are watching or listening
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.400]   that don't know Jesus.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.240]   We're talking about a really intimate relationship
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.680]   with an invisible God.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.960]   And I just wanna say, yeah,
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.040]   that's hard to get your head around.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.760]   And I think that the fact that that is hard for you
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.160]   to get your head around is okay.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.120]   I have loved Him a long time
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.640]   and it still kind of blows my mind.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.040]   The scripture says that we enter
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.660]   into the throne room of God when we pray.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.560]   And yet it's true.
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.640]   He's real.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.480]   He's not a myth.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.520]   And He loves you.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.320]   And He likes you.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:46.200]   And He wants a relationship with you.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.480]   This wasn't an obligatory relationship that He stepped into.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   He chose to create you and He chose to rescue you.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:00.560]   And He chose to begin a relationship with you
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.560]   if you want it.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.200]   So yeah, I mean, I'm talking to some of you
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.360]   that maybe don't have that relationship yet
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.480]   and you've never had that relationship.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.020]   But I also am thinking of all of you
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.880]   that haven't prayed in a really long time, if you're honest.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.180]   And that relationship has really gotten boring
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.200]   and cold and distant.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:22.760]   And all of us, He says, "Come back, kid, come back.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.720]   "I love you.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.320]   "I'm so happy that you're popping in my car,
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.940]   "telling me all your drama from school.
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.600]   "I wanna hear it all.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.420]   "I wanna know you.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.740]   "I want to be with you.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.160]   "I want to hear it all.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.360]   "And I wanna walk with you in it
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.400]   "'cause I made you."
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:43.040]   And the story of the gospel, if you've never heard it,
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:47.560]   is really extra crazy.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:52.560]   It's that God, Father, Son, Spirit decided before time
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:58.520]   to create us and that we would mess it up,
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.200]   but He would get us back.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:04.840]   And it would be costly.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.760]   It would be so costly.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.820]   And so Jesus came as a baby and He grew up
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.280]   and He showed us how much God likes us and loves us,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.780]   how much He wants a relationship with us.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.300]   He loved people.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.260]   He loved 'em and He liked 'em and He healed 'em
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.300]   and He cared for 'em.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.900]   And then He died for 'em.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.460]   He died for us.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.420]   He died for you.
[00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:29.320]   He died for me.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:32.140]   Because all of us have sinned.
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.500]   Not one of us have been righteous.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.540]   Not one of us have done what we need to do
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.700]   to be with God forever.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.740]   And so Jesus was the perfect one
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.660]   and He died on a cross for you.
[00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.140]   And all those sins and all those mistakes.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.060]   And the cool thing is He rose from the grave
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.840]   to show He has power over death,
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.100]   that death would not hold Him
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.580]   and death will not hold you.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.460]   For those who believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.560]   they will spend eternity with God.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.300]   It's the greatest story that has ever been told.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.860]   And it was true and real and happened.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.900]   And so we get God.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.460]   We get God.
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:09.660]   All of us that are sinners,
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:12.420]   all of us that don't deserve God, we get God.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:19.260]   If you want Him, if you choose Him, you get Him.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.780]   And the way you do that is you tell Him, you pray.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.420]   Say, God, I want a relationship with you.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.940]   I believe you did that for me.
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.540]   And so we're gonna do that.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.180]   We are gonna pray.
[00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.020]   We're gonna pray.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.300]   If this is the first time that you have ever trusted Him,
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.940]   that you're coming into a relationship with Him
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.100]   for the first time,
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.240]   all you have to do is pray with me.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.800]   Jesus, I believe you are God.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:52.180]   I believe that you died on a cross for my sins.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.480]   I put my faith, my hope in you as my Lord and Savior.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.380]   And I wanna follow you.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.200]   I wanna talk to you.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.660]   I wanna walk with you.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.800]   And when I don't, help me, keep me, and He will.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.980]   And for the rest of us that have known Jesus,
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.560]   maybe for a long time, maybe for years and years,
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.480]   maybe so long that we've forgotten how good it is,
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:22.820]   we get to also say, Jesus, you're my God.
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.980]   I love you, and I want to be close to you.
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.700]   I don't wanna talk to you again.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.260]   I'm sorry I've been far away,
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.540]   but I'm not gonna let shame and guilt keep me away
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.900]   'cause I need you.
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.540]   I need you, and I wanna be right with you.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.500]   I want to be close to you.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.980]   So help me.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.020]   Show me.
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:51.660]   And I think it's even fair, guys,
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:53.180]   I mean, just to even model this for you,
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.780]   like the thing I wanna say to you, God, right now
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.140]   is show up for them.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.500]   Like show up for them, show up for them
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.740]   in their desperation, show up for them in their anxiety,
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.580]   show up for them in their broken struggles with sin,
[00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:11.300]   show up for them as their desires are unmet.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.780]   God, show up for them.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.980]   Show up for them in a way that astounds them,
[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.540]   that blows their mind,
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.740]   that is bigger and better than they thought.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:25.700]   And we know you show up for us every day
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:27.100]   in a million ways, your word,
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.060]   and you show up for us.
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.900]   I know all the right answers, God,
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.580]   but I'm asking you in your spirit to just tonight,
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.860]   as they go to bed, every person listening to my voice,
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.620]   would they encounter you in a fresh way?
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:42.900]   'Cause you're real.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.660]   You're not pretend.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.220]   We don't speak to the air.
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.900]   We speak to the living God with the power and authority
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.460]   over the darkness, so God, help us believe again.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.180]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.380]   - Would you guys thank Jenny Allen?
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:07.700]   Jenny, thank you.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.060]   Please come back.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.100]   So grateful for you.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.060]   Let's stand together.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.860]   Let's respond by singing tonight.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
