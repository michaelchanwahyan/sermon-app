[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.620]   - Ports, how we doing?
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.880]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.360]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.080]   Man, I love worshiping with a band.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.200]   I don't know where you're at, Fort Worth or Houston
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.720]   or wherever you're gathering.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.200]   I hope, hopefully you just were able to worship the Lord
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.560]   through some gifted musicians.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.400]   Can we just thank the band who point us to Jesus?
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.560]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.440]   It's awesome, man.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.960]   It is awesome to be pointed to our creator with those guys.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.760]   Anybody here in a band?
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.920]   Like those guys are so cool.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.520]   I mean, they're in band.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.980]   I was in band like when it wasn't so cool to be in band.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.820]   Anybody else?
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.640]   Anybody else in band?
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.960]   Like that you're proud of it?
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.800]   Like, yeah, yeah.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.680]   No, you don't have to do this, do this.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.020]   It's like, yeah, I was in band.
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.760]   What'd you play?
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.200]   - Percussion.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.420]   - Trumpet, percussion.
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.880]   I played percussion.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.880]   That's just a fancy way to say drums.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.040]   I wanted to be like those guys who played the quads.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.080]   You know, anybody who, you know, those guys.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.920]   I went and I got my snare drum and go and you get it.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.820]   And there I was in sixth grade.
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840]   I had my snare drum and I was so excited about it.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.760]   And I don't wanna brag,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.920]   but for the first couple of weeks,
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.880]   I was first chair every week.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.720]   No big deal.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.960]   Don't treat me different, okay?
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.880]   Just a normal guy, first chair.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.360]   And I remember my sister loved Metallica.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   And she was my older sister.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.120]   She loved Metallica.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.920]   Metallica's drummer was so amazing.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.740]   His name was Lars.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.880]   He would just go off on the kit.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.800]   And that's what I thought I was gonna be like.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.720]   So I signed up for band in the sixth grade.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.320]   Well, then we go to competition and they put me,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.920]   I heard one of you, you shout it like the triangle, okay?
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.000]   Like that was my role in the competition.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.820]   All these guys were doing all this crazy stuff
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.620]   on the drums and I was like, ding, you know?
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.280]   Hit some blocks or something.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.440]   And so it was, you know, as the next two years,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320]   I was in band, the next two years progressed.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.200]   Here's what happened.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720]   I started out first chair.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.360]   First chair, if you weren't in band,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.000]   that's just a really good thing.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.040]   And then as the weeks went on, the next 24 months went on,
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.440]   I moved to middle chair.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.520]   And then that kind of next year, I sat in last chair
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880]   and I stayed there and I never moved on.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.720]   Here's why.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.240]   I learned I'm not real passionate about the drums.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.600]   And because I wasn't super passionate about the drums,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.400]   I didn't practice like some of my peers did.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.500]   Like they were passionate.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.440]   They went home, they practiced every night.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.100]   They disciplined themselves.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.640]   They moved on to other percussion instruments.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.960]   I sat there with the triangle in my last chair
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.500]   because my passion for the drums was waning.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.360]   You know, I don't know if you know
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.680]   what they're saying about us.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.560]   The reason I start with that story
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.400]   is because what they're saying
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   is that if we're not passionate about something,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   then we don't apply ourselves to it.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.200]   That's what they're saying about our generation.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.520]   I don't know what you think about that.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.280]   You can take that and be insulted
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.480]   or you can inspect your life and ask, is it true?
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.520]   Is that something that marks me?
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.440]   Is that something that's true for me?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.400]   I can remember thinking when I was playing the drums
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.040]   is man, this is hard.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.160]   It doesn't feel natural.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.760]   And if it doesn't come natural and it seems difficult,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.160]   it must not be right.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.480]   Maybe you start questioning yourself.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.460]   Maybe I wasn't made to do this.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.840]   If I'm not great at it, it must not be my thing.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.280]   Did you know that only 1% of people
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.760]   are naturally, extraordinarily gifted at something?
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.280]   Less than 1% actually.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.160]   Think genius, think savant.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.560]   Think like be able to step up to a piano
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.240]   for the first time and play it by ear.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.960]   Less than 1% of people.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.400]   Do you know what that means for us,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.040]   the other 99 plus percent of people?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.580]   If we're going to do anything great in this life,
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.840]   it is going to require discipline.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.080]   That's the truth.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.320]   If you are going to accomplish anything extraordinary
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.240]   with the days the Lord has trusted to you on this planet,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.600]   it is going to require you pushing through the discomfort
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   and embracing the grind and disciplining yourself.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.420]   And so we're in this series, Vice and Virtue.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   And tonight we're talking about laziness and discipline.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.320]   Laziness and discipline.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.280]   Laziness is simply the lack of discipline.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.340]   I'd ask you right now, do you think you're lazy?
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.320]   Most of us don't think we're lazy.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.840]   How many of you hope to wake up this morning
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.280]   to look out the window and see a blanket of white snow?
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   Yeah, me too, me too.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.520]   I was excited about that.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.920]   Now I'm glad I'm not the only one.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   And why?
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.560]   Because you wanted to stay home.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   You went to bed last night hoping
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.640]   that work would be canceled today.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.480]   Are you lazy?
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.960]   How many of you made New Year's resolutions?
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.280]   They say 40%.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.680]   40% of us made New Year's resolutions.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.440]   Just for comparison, 33% of us watched the Super Bowl.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.280]   40% of us made New Year's resolutions.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.120]   What were they?
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.200]   They were around disciplines.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.800]   I'll give you some of the five most popular ones.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.640]   Be disciplined to lose weight.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.000]   Be disciplined to exercise more.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200]   Be disciplined to eat healthier.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.360]   Get a better job.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.280]   Get closer to God actually made the list.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   And did you know that January 12th is National Quitters Day?
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.840]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.560]   That is where statistically most people
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   stop their New Year's resolutions.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.920]   We make it into the year 12 days.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.960]   Now I don't know where you're at in that journey,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.720]   but they say 8% of people keep their resolutions.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.720]   92% of Americans stop.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.960]   Why?
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.920]   Because we're lazy.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.720]   Because we're lazy.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   And some of us have even a work to be lazy mentality.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.440]   I know you don't think you're lazy because you're busy.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.560]   And what I want you to know is just because you're busy
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.480]   doesn't mean you're not lazy.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.640]   The Proverbs actually speak to this idea
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.920]   that we can be doing a lot of things but not progressing,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.480]   not doing something productive.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.600]   Our life not producing anything great.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.440]   We're just busy.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.880]   You've heard of crazy busy.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.720]   I'm talking about lazy busy.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.240]   That we would sit in a bunch of motion.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   That we would create a lot of energy,
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.800]   but there would be no productivity.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.240]   See, some of us have a work to be lazy mentality.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.640]   We go to work on Monday, waiting for Friday,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.400]   drudging through the week,
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.520]   hoping to get to that finish line
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.720]   so we can kick up our feet and take it easy.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.400]   And if you don't believe me on that week to week basis,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.120]   just think about retirement.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.240]   Like some of us just think,
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.440]   hey, we're gonna work hard when we're young,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.720]   hope to make a lot of money, store it up in a 401k,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.080]   and then kick up our feet and take it easy.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.360]   Our goal, our literal goal in life is to be lazy.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.920]   That's what we hope to accomplish with our life
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.940]   is to one day be able to afford to be lazy.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.240]   Are we lazy?
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.420]   Are we lazy?
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:56.760]   If you're not convinced, I want to turn to the Proverbs.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.280]   It's in the Old Testament.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.600]   It's a book written by kings,
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.960]   most of mostly the King Solomon,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.840]   the wisest man who ever lived.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.840]   It's the book of wisdom.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.720]   It's principles for us to live our life by.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.600]   And in the book of Proverbs, there's lots of characters.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.400]   You have a lady wisdom, the wise.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.760]   You have the fool.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.040]   You have the characters of the scoffers.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.640]   You have the isolated man.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.560]   You have the noble woman of Proverbs 31.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.960]   You have those who are wise in their eyes.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.040]   And then you get to the one that we're gonna look at
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.680]   this evening called the sluggard.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.720]   When you hear me say sluggard, think lazy person.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.880]   The Proverbs talks about this character
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.960]   about a dozen times.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.380]   We'll address most of them.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.440]   I'm gonna jump around, but let me start here in Proverbs 26
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.540]   so I can continue to ask the questions.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.000]   As we move through the Proverbs,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.220]   we're gonna look at the topic of laziness, three things.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.100]   The cause of laziness, the cost of laziness,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.040]   what it costs you, 'cause the cost is high.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.560]   And then before you leave here this evening,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.920]   the cure for laziness from the Proverbs.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.800]   So we'll start in here in Proverbs 26.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.320]   It says this in verse 13.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.440]   A sluggard says, "There's a lion in the road,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.280]   "a fierce lion roaming the streets."
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.560]   Now what does that mean?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.920]   The lazy person says there's a lion in the road.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.960]   It's a riddle.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.160]   Sometimes these proverbial sayings or riddles
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   is saying that a lazy person will make any excuse
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.720]   not to go to work.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.800]   There's a lion in the road.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.200]   There's ice in the road.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.600]   There's ice in the streets.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.800]   I can't go.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.320]   What is your excuse?
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.140]   I'm just not passionate about my work, man.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.680]   I don't believe in the product.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.400]   My boss is a jerk.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.560]   They don't give me enough vacation.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.240]   They don't pay me enough.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.360]   I think I was made for something different.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.280]   And then verse 14, it says,
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.280]   "As the door turns on its hinges,
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.360]   "so a slugger turns on his bed."
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.680]   What does this mean?
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.640]   Again, it's a riddle.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.840]   What does a door hinge do?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   It moves a lot but goes nowhere.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.460]   Lots of movement but it doesn't do anything.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.380]   The slugger turns on his bed.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.380]   You can picture the person laying on their bed,
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.900]   rolling over and hitting the snooze button
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.300]   again and again and again.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.140]   Did you know that if you hit,
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.580]   anybody snooze button?
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.740]   Who snooze this morning?
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.100]   Okay, you're proud of that.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.380]   Did you know that if you hit the snooze button
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.820]   for 15 minutes, just 15 minutes a day,
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.700]   if you snooze for just 15 minutes a day,
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.900]   that's 92 hours a year.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.440]   That's four whole days of sleep
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.400]   at the end of a year.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.880]   That's you not getting out of bed
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.420]   for four whole 24-hour days.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.820]   Just hitting the snooze button once, 15 minutes.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.460]   Like a door hinge, not going anywhere.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.160]   "A slugger buries his hand in the dish.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.380]   "He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth."
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.240]   What does that mean?
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.080]   It's a riddle.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.620]   It means they don't finish what they start.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.140]   They don't finish what they start.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.540]   I tell my kids they can play any sport they wanna play,
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.740]   but if we start it, they're gonna finish it.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.860]   My daughter this year started playing basketball,
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.440]   and before her first game,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.820]   she broke her finger in two places.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.680]   Doctor said she couldn't play basketball.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.140]   She's thinking, "Oh, season's over.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.340]   "I'm just not gonna be on the team."
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.060]   No, no, no, we're gonna go to every game
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.340]   because you signed up to play.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.540]   We're gonna finish.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.520]   You're gonna sit on the sidelines.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.420]   You're gonna cheer on your team.
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.260]   You're gonna sit with your team.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.100]   You're gonna cheer them on.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.340]   "A slugger is wiser in his own eyes
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.860]   "than seven people who answer discreetly."
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.340]   A slugger says, "I work hard, not smart.
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.860]   "I mean, I work smart, not hard."
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.640]   Like a pro will show you they're a pro by what they do.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.580]   A slugger, a lazy person says,
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.220]   "Hey, they're always a coach, never a player.
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.460]   "Hey, I know everything about everything.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.300]   "I've done these things.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.120]   "Hey, sit back.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.960]   "Let me tell you how to do it.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.100]   "Let me tell you how good I am.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.120]   "Don't make me show you, though.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.060]   "Don't make me get up from the couch."
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.620]   And so let's just ask some questions
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.340]   before we dive in further.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.660]   Let's ask some questions from these texts.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.180]   Verse 13, "Do we make excuses to get out of discipline?
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.460]   "I can't go to work today because,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.920]   "I'm hitting snooze because,
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.720]   "I can't spend time with God this morning.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.560]   "I'll do it later.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.380]   "I'll do it this evening.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.960]   "I'll do it before I go to bed."
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.540]   Verse 14, "Are we busy but lack something
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.780]   "to show for the busyness?"
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.620]   Not getting better, not getting greater,
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.020]   not producing something great.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.940]   Do we start things but not finish them?
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.900]   In verse 15, "Job to job, ambition to ambition,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.640]   "diet to diet, I'm gonna work out this time,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.420]   "gym membership to gym membership,
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.700]   "hobby to hobby, no, I found the thing.
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.140]   "No, it's not the thing."
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.120]   You ever, you meet somebody, they're like,
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.300]   "Dude, I love my job.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.500]   "I got the best job in the world.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.740]   "I got a new job, it's awesome."
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.620]   And you talk to 'em like two months later,
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:45.580]   you're like, "Dude, how's it going?"
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.780]   "Oh, I quit, man, it sucked.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.940]   "My job was awful."
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.700]   And then you see 'em again, "Oh, but I got a new job!
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.940]   "It's awesome!"
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.740]   "So great, my boss!"
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.220]   And then you see 'em later, "How's it going?"
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.420]   "Oh, got laid off."
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.940]   It's always something, you know?
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.940]   Thing to thing to thing.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.020]   And why?
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.600]   Why would anybody be lazy?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.820]   I think it's different than you think.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.340]   Let's talk about the cause of laziness.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.540]   My first point, the cause of laziness.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.580]   You might be tempted to think that laziness
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.460]   is the lack of a desire or the lack of drive.
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.100]   It is not that.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.140]   Laziness is an intense drive, it's an intense desire.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.100]   The reason that you hoped that it would,
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.300]   that the roads would freeze last night
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.660]   is not because you don't have a desire,
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.860]   it's because you had a desire to what?
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.660]   Stay in your PJs all day, sit by a fire,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.620]   and binge on Netflix.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.700]   You have a desire to be comfortable.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.820]   Laziness is driven by a deep desire for comfort.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.300]   Let me show you from the Proverbs.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.620]   Proverbs 13, verse four.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.980]   "A sluggard's appetite is never filled,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.740]   "but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied."
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.980]   In the ESV it says,
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.900]   "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing."
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.580]   Proverbs 21, verse 25, it says,
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.260]   "The craving of a sluggard will be death to them."
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.680]   They have a craving.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.400]   "But his hands refuse to work.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.240]   "All day long he craves for more but the righteousness,
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.020]   "but the righteous give without sparing."
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.460]   What does a sluggard or lazy person crave?
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.580]   They crave comfort.
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.220]   The cause of laziness is a craving for comfort.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.060]   Write that down.
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.060]   The cause of laziness is a craving for comfort.
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.260]   It's wanting comfort ultimately.
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.340]   Your problem is not laziness.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.220]   It's the idolatry or the worship of comfort
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.000]   which produces laziness.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.660]   It's that I don't want to do anything
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.260]   that I don't want to do.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.700]   It's believing this lie,
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.340]   and this is so popular among us and our peers,
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.980]   believing this lie
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.220]   that if it doesn't come completely natural to me,
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.740]   if it's not easy,
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.940]   then I shouldn't have to do it,
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.020]   or maybe I'm doing the wrong thing.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.220]   And the enemy, he'll convince you of that,
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.820]   and he'll keep you in apathy
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.500]   so that you never produce anything great with your life.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.900]   There's a lot of examples of this.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.980]   I think that the ultimate goal of the enemy
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.900]   is that he would just keep you in a place
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.940]   of doing nothing great for the kingdom,
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.500]   nothing great with your life,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   not living your purpose.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.780]   There was an anti-drug commercial in the '90s.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.820]   It was called Pete's Couch.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.700]   You can look it up on YouTube later.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.040]   Maybe you saw it as I did.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.940]   This was a season of my life where I was doing drugs.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.780]   I was smoking a lot of weed at this time in my life,
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.580]   and so I was interested in this commercial
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.580]   because there were so many crazy commercials out there.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.860]   This is your brain on drugs, scrambled eggs and whatnot,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.980]   and that just didn't appeal to me,
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.380]   but this particular commercial, I was like,
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.140]   okay, there's some truth in that,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.260]   and essentially, they were sitting on Pete's couch,
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.100]   and he's like, you know, and the guy starts talking.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.860]   He's like, hey, I smoked weed, and nothing happened.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.940]   I didn't die.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.340]   I didn't do heroin.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.640]   I didn't get in a wreck.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.940]   Nothing happened.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.900]   I smoked weed, and you know what happened?
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.740]   Nothing.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.120]   We just sat on Pete's couch,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.360]   and then it talked about how we didn't go mountain biking.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   We didn't go on a date at the ice skating rink.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.900]   We didn't do anything great.
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.180]   We did nothing.
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.700]   We sat on Pete's couch.
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.200]   This is a great picture of laziness.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.900]   What's at risk with laziness?
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.860]   That you would get to the end of this race,
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.260]   and a lot of people would stand up at your funeral,
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.420]   and they would talk about all the great things
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.320]   that you did, except there aren't any.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.900]   There's nothing to say.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:44.800]   Man, they were really good at relaxing.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:48.620]   Taking it easy.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.460]   Man, you know, I remember when they caught
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.360]   the whole season on Netflix, and it was awesome.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:59.340]   And there's nothing.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.100]   Don't be this person, man.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.000]   You were made for so much greater than that.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.220]   God made you for incredible purposes
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.220]   that the enemy wants you to miss out on.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.180]   If you're here, he has a plan for you,
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.580]   and so let's look at the cost of laziness, right?
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.640]   The cost of laziness.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.620]   I'm gonna give you four P words from the Proverbs.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.980]   Proverbs 6, verse 11.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.740]   "Poverty will come on the sluggard like a thief,
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.760]   "and scarcity like an armed man."
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.860]   One of the things that laziness will certainly cost you
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.420]   is prosperity.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.940]   Remember when you were little, and maybe you played M*A*S*H
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.420]   in the third grade or something, and you thought,
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.240]   "Hey, when I get older, I'm gonna be rich.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.540]   "We all think we're gonna be rich.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.180]   "We all think we're gonna be millionaires."
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.780]   And you get here, and you realize the only way
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.460]   you're really going to be rich
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.340]   is if you work really, really hard.
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.860]   Maybe you were born into it.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.340]   Probably you're like the rest of us,
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.180]   and you're going to have to work really, really hard.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.980]   You're gonna have to discipline yourself.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.780]   Laziness will cost you prosperity.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.020]   It says, "Lazy people do not plow in season,
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.220]   "so at harvest time, they look but find nothing."
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.020]   It's Proverbs 20, verse four.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.140]   "Laziness costs you progress."
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.620]   You won't go anywhere.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.260]   You won't have anything to show for your work.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.900]   It's like a door hinge.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.580]   You're lazy, busy, lots of motion, nothing to show for it.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.900]   You cannot have any tremendous output
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.760]   without the input of hard work and discipline.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.620]   That's just a fact of life.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.740]   That's what's called the law of the harvest.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.220]   Proverbs 10, verse 26, "As vinegar to the teeth
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.140]   "and smoke to the eyes, so are sluggards
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.260]   "to those who send them."
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.200]   It's saying, "Hey, these sluggards, these lazy people,
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.980]   "they cause frustration to those they work for.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.260]   "They're bitter like vinegar."
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.460]   Or you don't wanna be around 'em,
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.420]   you don't wanna look at 'em like smoke to the eyes.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.420]   Laziness costs you people's trust or reputation.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.460]   But I think the greatest risk, friends,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.640]   is laziness costs you your purpose.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.420]   Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are God's workmanship.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.220]   "We are his masterpiece."
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.580]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.860]   Just stop for a second to think about that.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.500]   That there's a God, he's an artist, he's a creator.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.860]   He created you.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.700]   He made your ears the way they are,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.820]   your nose the way it is.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.700]   He gave your eyes the color they are.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.360]   He gave you some talents, some skills.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.220]   Some of you are fast, he made you that way.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.740]   "For we are God's workmanship,
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.220]   "created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.860]   "which he prepared in advance for us to do."
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:33.020]   We were created for what?
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.380]   To do good works.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.300]   That God, the creator, prepared in advance
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.780]   for you to walk in, that that's your purpose.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.740]   But if you waste your days here pursuing comforts,
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.980]   then you miss out on your purpose.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.960]   And you don't walk through the good works
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.180]   which God prepared for you to walk through.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.260]   You stay on Pete's couch.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.000]   And your life passes you by.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.180]   See, laziness is feeding your comfort.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.740]   It's not doing anything unless you feel like it.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.320]   But Christ, he calls us to a different message.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.780]   He calls us to embrace discomfort.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.300]   He says in Luke 9 and also Matthew 16,
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.940]   Jesus says to them, "Whoever wants to be my disciple,"
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.780]   anybody wanna be his disciple?
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.780]   "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves."
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.820]   What that means is must deny themselves comfort,
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.500]   must not just feed their appetites,
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.740]   must not just do what they wanna do.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.020]   They must deny themselves and take up their cross daily
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.300]   and follow me.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.340]   For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:39.020]   but whoever loses their life for me will save it.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.140]   The cost of laziness is not carrying your cross.
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.280]   The cost of laziness is a wasted life.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.300]   The cost of laziness is a wasted life.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.780]   That's what's at risk, a wasted life.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:55.340]   You won't grow.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.220]   You won't get better.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.860]   You won't be great at anything.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.660]   My wife and I, we have three kids.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.300]   Our son is five.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.620]   His name is Weston.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.780]   He's been coming in our room at night,
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.140]   like in the middle of the night,
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.680]   like last night at three in the morning,
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.660]   which is a terrifying thing to wake up
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.700]   and have a five-year-old staring at you.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.620]   And he's moaning and crying.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.540]   And he's not sensitive.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.220]   When he's crying, something's wrong.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.340]   And so for the past few weeks, he's been doing this.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.220]   I'm like, "Buddy, what's wrong?"
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.420]   He's like, "Daddy, my legs hurt.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.380]   "My legs hurt."
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.780]   And so we take him to the doctor.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.240]   And we're like, "Hey, he says his legs hurt.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.700]   "Like, what is it?"
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.580]   As a parent, you don't wanna see your kids
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.100]   in pain like that.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.280]   And my son is probably gonna be tall.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.980]   And the doctor just says, "Hey, this is growing pain."
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.660]   As his body is producing cells
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.060]   and the bones are growing
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.940]   and the muscles stretching,
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.640]   as his body is growing, those growth plates are shifting,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.260]   and he's experiencing some pain.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.980]   And I was reminded of a boss that I had
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.060]   when I was in the corporate world.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.900]   He would tell me this.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.320]   He'd say, "JP, you only grow when you're uncomfortable.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.640]   "The only time you grow is when you're uncomfortable.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.560]   "And you think that's true physically,
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.640]   "that's true spiritually, that's true personally.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.900]   "You only grow when you're uncomfortable.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.240]   "If you wanna grow, you have to press in to discomfort.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.020]   "You have to carry your cross.
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.140]   "If you never deny yourself,
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.380]   "you are denying yourself growth.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:43.180]   "If you never deny yourself in the pursuit of comfort,
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.420]   "you are actually denying yourself growth.
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.100]   "You will not grow personally."
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.960]   Just think about it.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.820]   I mean, if anybody's New Year's resolution
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.560]   is to get in the gym more, mine was, right?
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.820]   You get in there and you have to press
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.140]   through the discomfort of lifting weights,
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.480]   the discomfort of the class,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.700]   the discomfort of what you're going through,
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.340]   and as a result, you will grow.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:13.280]   You will not grow spiritually.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.340]   Like, some of us have the illusion
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.440]   that one day something's gonna happen,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.500]   we're gonna wake up, we're just, we're gonna like,
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.820]   it's like God is gonna send His Holy Spirit
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.340]   to pull back the covers and to lift us out of the bed
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.980]   and move us to the table
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.020]   and set a cup of coffee in front of us,
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.300]   and it's just gonna be like coffee with Jesus.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.180]   It's gonna be so rich, you know,
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.340]   and we're just sitting there, you and Jesus,
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.500]   and y'all are just catching up, having a great time,
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.740]   and He's teaching you, you know,
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.340]   this word here in the Greek, it means,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.900]   and you're walking around, you know,
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.180]   like walking away from the Bible,
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.620]   and you just learned it, taught by the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.500]   and you look back at that, and you're like,
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.020]   man, that was so rich, I can't wait to do it tomorrow.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.340]   Some of you have that illusion,
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.860]   and maybe that happens,
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.220]   or maybe you enjoyed your quiet time this morning,
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.380]   but can I tell you something?
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.880]   Sometimes it's a grind.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.900]   It's called a spiritual discipline,
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.780]   that you wake up tomorrow even when you don't feel like it,
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.280]   and you study the Scripture
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.180]   even when you don't feel like it,
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:23.100]   and you pray regardless of if you feel like it or not.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.300]   Like, that's what I'm trying to tell you,
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.860]   and I hope you find relief in this.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.540]   You don't have to like it for it to be right.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.540]   You might just do it out of discipline.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.980]   Some days you might enjoy it.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:39.760]   Some days it might be grind,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.420]   and that doesn't mean it's wrong.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.380]   You will not grow professionally.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.780]   Like, you might not like your job.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.540]   You know what a great opportunity is for growth?
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.360]   A job you hate.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.420]   You might not enjoy your job.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.220]   Do you know that's why they pay you?
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.900]   See, if you enjoyed it,
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.180]   you might be tempted to do it for free,
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.800]   and they might be like, "Hey, we're gonna keep our money,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.880]   "and you just keep showing up
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.420]   "and doing that thing you enjoy,"
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.000]   and it's called a hobby,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.620]   but they pay you to be there
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.380]   because they know you don't like it.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.780]   That's the exchange.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.660]   That's what's going on there, right?
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.100]   And it doesn't matter if you don't like it.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.200]   Be awesome at it.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.960]   There's an application for you.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.380]   Whatever you do,
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.820]   work at it as though you're working for the Lord.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.900]   Titus 2:10 says that you make the teachings
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.280]   of Jesus our Savior attractive.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.660]   So you be awesome at it.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.280]   You work to get great at it.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.260]   I've had a lot of jobs, man, a lot of jobs.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.700]   I worked at Courtesy Car Wash, wiping down cars.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.420]   I was a lifeguard.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.260]   I worked at Gadzooks in the mall.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.660]   It was in my raving days.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.860]   We don't wanna go back there.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.580]   And then I worked at Champ Sports,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.900]   slinging them Js, sold tennis shoes
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.100]   for like five years, Champ Sports.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.860]   Got into college, waited tables, did that thing,
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.820]   and then I was a graphic designer
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.700]   out of college for a short time.
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.980]   I was in business development in corporate America.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.940]   That's a fancy term for sales.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.820]   Had a lot of jobs.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.780]   I had one particular job that I hated.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.220]   This is the job I hated the most.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.340]   It was working for my dad.
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.880]   He owned a surveying business.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.780]   You guys know what surveying is?
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.940]   It's like where you measure land, essentially.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.620]   So don't think like surveying in Dallas.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.180]   We lived in the country,
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.180]   and so surveying was like measuring
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.540]   hundreds or thousands of acres.
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.020]   And so if I showed you this, that yellow line there,
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.540]   we'd have to draw that line
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.300]   by putting those two points together.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.220]   But here was the problem.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.220]   If you go to the next picture,
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.820]   here's what the landscape looked like.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.740]   The other one.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.340]   The brush, it was just like thick brush, right?
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.860]   And so they put little JP 100 yards away,
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.980]   and then they would hold this sign that you couldn't see,
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.020]   and then they would give me a machete,
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.820]   and they'd say, "Hey, you'd have to cut that brush
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.460]   "for 100 yards so that it would look like this,"
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.420]   the next picture.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.540]   And you'd have to cut a line.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.540]   My job for a summer was literally chopping down brush
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.420]   every single day of my life,
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.260]   and I hated it with all of my heart.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.100]   I hated it.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.260]   But I look back on that with fond memories,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.940]   because it taught me to do something I didn't love.
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.920]   It produced in my life work ethic,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.980]   that when I didn't feel like going to work,
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.360]   and I still had to,
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.340]   it taught me that I won't always just wanna wake up
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.380]   the next day and do whatever the task is before me.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.840]   I never wanted to do that,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.020]   but I had to,
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.460]   'cause it was my responsibility,
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.500]   'cause it was my job.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:05.460]   And so I know you were asked a lot when you were younger,
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.020]   "What do you wanna be when you grow up?"
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.340]   The problem happens when you grow up
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.980]   and you're not what you wanna be,
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.740]   or you realize you don't really wanna be
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.940]   what you thought you wanted to be when you grow up.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.820]   The key word there is want.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.420]   What happens when the want's not there?
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.740]   What happens when the desire's not there?
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.500]   See, what happened in Genesis 3,
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.660]   if you're new to church or the Bible,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.380]   Genesis 3 is God created the world,
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.620]   and he created man, and he put man in the world,
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.120]   and it was a perfect world, and all was right.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.940]   In Genesis 3, man chose a way
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.900]   that was different than what God had for him.
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.240]   Sin entered the world,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.780]   and then it talks about the result of that sin,
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.740]   and one of the specified results is,
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.660]   now you will work and it will be hard.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.240]   Now you're gonna work the ground,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.460]   and it's gonna fight against you.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.020]   A result of sin, here's the truth about work.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.380]   Work is supposed to be hard.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.700]   Today, in the fallen world that we live in,
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.580]   work is hard.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.500]   That's the truth.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.780]   You know what's interesting about Genesis and work?
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.220]   Work shows up in Genesis 1 when God created man,
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.860]   and he says, hey, I want you to work the ground
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.620]   and subdue it.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.540]   That's hard work.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.980]   That's shovel in hand, digging holes,
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.620]   digging ditches kind of work.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.620]   It's difficult work, but the reality of that being
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.180]   in Genesis 1 is it's before Genesis 3.
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.380]   When God created a perfect world, there was work.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.260]   Work is not the result of the fall.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.460]   In fact, you and I will work in heaven.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.300]   That's the truth.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.180]   We will have jobs in heaven.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.940]   And so work is good.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.280]   Work is hard because of sin.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.220]   Not because you have the wrong job.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.580]   Not because you're doing the wrong thing.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.980]   It's hard because of sin.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.380]   So what's the cure?
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.340]   Let's talk about the cure for laziness.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.940]   As you consider Jesus' example,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.980]   think about when he was in the garden.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.020]   As Jesus was a human, he had to do things
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.980]   he didn't wanna do.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.020]   One of the things that he didn't wanna do
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.660]   or didn't feel like doing was going to a cross
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.800]   to be publicly humiliated and tortured to death.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.760]   The reason he did that was because he loved you and me.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.900]   But in the garden, when he's talking to the Father,
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.460]   he says, Lord, Father, would you let this cup pass from me?
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.400]   This thing that you're asking me to do,
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.420]   it's so big and it's so hard.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.620]   I don't know that I want to, but not my will.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.100]   Your will be done.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.980]   And we can learn from Christ's example
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.540]   that as we go to work tomorrow,
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.320]   he said, God, this is really hard,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.900]   but what is your will in it?
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.620]   What would you like to produce in and through my life
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.740]   through this?
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.880]   And by Jesus' example, what we learn is simply this.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.060]   Just because something is hard doesn't mean it's wrong.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.680]   You've gotta leave here with that truth,
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.220]   that just because something is hard doesn't mean it's wrong.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.500]   And when something is difficult but necessary,
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.820]   it requires discipline.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.220]   And that's really the application of this message.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.820]   The cure for laziness is discipline despite difficulty.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.820]   You can write that down.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.940]   The cure for laziness is discipline despite difficulty.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.300]   Proverbs 6 says this.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.820]   Go to the ant, you sluggard, lazy person.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.020]   Look at the ant.
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.780]   Consider its ways and be wise.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.340]   It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.620]   yet it stores its provision in summer
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.460]   and gathers its food at harvest.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.460]   It doesn't know,
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:46.540]   it doesn't know or care or think about,
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.620]   hey, is this hard?
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:52.380]   It says, hey, this has to be done, so I'll do it.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.220]   Because I need to do it to live.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.680]   And so it does it.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.860]   And so it requires discipline.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:03.300]   Professional laziness requires professional discipline.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.380]   It's learning a skill, developing it, growing in it.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.500]   Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book called Outliers,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.020]   and he came up with this idea that
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.940]   to master something, to be great at anything,
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.420]   requires 10,000 hours.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.940]   Macklemore later wrote a song about this called 10,000 Hours.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.860]   He actually references Malcolm Gladwell in the song.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.580]   He's saying, hey, to do anything great
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.860]   requires 10,000 hours of grind.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.300]   Not 10,000 hours of pleasure, 10,000 hours of enjoyment,
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.780]   but 10,000 hours of discipline
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.500]   that you're going to continue to press into the grind,
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.580]   that you're going to honor God in the grind.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.740]   And so the cure for spiritual laziness
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.060]   is spiritual discipline.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.860]   That's why they're called spiritual disciplines,
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.380]   reading the word or praying or getting in community,
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.620]   going to church, fasting.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.180]   These are spiritual disciplines.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.660]   They mark your life, whether you feel like it or not.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.380]   So did you wake up this morning,
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.020]   listen, did you wake up this morning
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.080]   and spend the first part of your day in God's Word?
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.600]   And if you didn't, if you didn't,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.160]   then I just would challenge you tomorrow to do so.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.840]   If you're like, man, that's hard, how do I do it?
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.960]   Let me tell you how to do it.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.600]   Let me break it down for you, okay?
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.180]   Listen, how long do you want to spend in God's Word?
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.320]   Let's just say 30 minutes.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.220]   Okay, spend a half an hour reading a scripture and praying,
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.840]   asking God to protect you in the day,
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.040]   that you would be faithful in the day,
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.360]   you would do his will in that day.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.240]   You say, well, how are we going to do that?
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.400]   So here, whatever time you woke up this morning,
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.520]   just back up your alarm 30 minutes.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.220]   Okay, back it up 30 minutes.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.560]   You cool?
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.380]   Some of you are like shaking your hand,
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.220]   like no, I can't do that.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.040]   Yes, you can.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.440]   I promise you can do that.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.560]   Back it up 30 minutes.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.960]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.520]   You're like, yeah, but I'm just going to hit snooze.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   No, you're not.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.240]   We're going to move the alarm across the room.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.080]   Okay, move it, yeah.
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.800]   Oh, some gas, you know.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.760]   You're going to be okay.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.000]   I'm walking you through this.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.120]   Write it down, it's going to be okay.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   Call me, actually call David, and we'll help you, okay?
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.760]   So back it up, back up the alarm 30 minutes.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.840]   Now, here's the tricky part.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.280]   Put the alarm across the room.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.120]   If it's your phone, if it's an alarm clock, whatever,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.480]   put it on the other side of the room.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.720]   You got to get up to turn it off.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.160]   Okay, your roommates are going to hate you.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.440]   And then here's what I want you to do.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.040]   I want you to put your Bible on top of your alarm, okay?
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.320]   So that before you turn it off,
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.200]   you got to pick up your Bible.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.840]   You're already holding it in your hand, okay?
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.120]   That's half the battle right there, right?
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.080]   So you get up, you curse me.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.480]   You walk across the room, okay?
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.100]   You pick up your Bible, you turn off your alarm,
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.080]   and then just keep walking to the kitchen, okay?
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.280]   And sit down, make yourself a cup of coffee,
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.080]   and just spend 30 minutes.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.920]   You're like, I don't know what to do.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.400]   Go to jointhejourney.com, we'll help you.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.000]   You can read the same thing I will tomorrow.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.480]   You can think, man, this is the same thing.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.120]   JP's reading, DeMar's reading, Todd Wagner's reading.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.520]   We're all reading the same thing.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.640]   Be a short little scripture.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.600]   You can read it, you can read a Devo,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.480]   you can pray about it.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.520]   I want you to do it tomorrow.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.360]   You know what?
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.280]   I'll do it in the next 30 days.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.400]   Let me tell you what's gonna happen in the next 30 days.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.320]   30 days, yeah, 30 days, you're gonna be okay.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.000]   30 days, here's what I want you to do.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.880]   Here's what's gonna happen.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.280]   You're gonna wake up and you're gonna think,
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.880]   you know what, I'll do that at lunch.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   No, you won't.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.080]   Do it in the morning, tomorrow morning.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.400]   You think, you know, I'll do it before I go to bed.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.720]   Stop it.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.520]   Stop making excuses.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.160]   There's a lion in the road, there's a lion.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.800]   No, stop, there's no lion.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.600]   It's Dallas, okay?
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.520]   It's Texas, there's no lion.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.800]   Pick up your Bible, walk to the kitchen,
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.640]   and get in that 30 minutes.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.280]   And do it for 30 days, it'll be a habit after that.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.680]   It will become easier and easier, I think so.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.960]   You tell me if I'm wrong, come back and say,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   I did it, it wasn't easier.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.040]   But let's just do that, just commit to doing that.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.240]   Discipline yourself.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.220]   The cure for personal laziness is to grow in discipline.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.520]   You know, working out, eating right.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.640]   Listen, this is something I struggle with.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.560]   You've heard me say a bunch of times,
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.240]   we've been here long, I hate working out.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.120]   'Cause it's hard, it's not fun.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.920]   Nothing fun about it.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.120]   Not for me, anyways.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.800]   And you know what, when it comes to food,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.880]   I like to eat whatever I want to eat.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.560]   So I had my own resolutions.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.200]   I started 2018 with a juice cleanse.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.160]   Pray for me.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.240]   Not eating anything solid, just drinking juice.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.480]   My son, my five-year-old's like,
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480]   Daddy, why would you do that?
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.280]   I'm like, that's a good question, I don't know.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.840]   [congregation laughing]
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.760]   But here's why.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.660]   Because I don't want to be a slave to my cravings.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.200]   I don't want to be a slave to my body.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.060]   I want my body to be a slave to me.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.120]   I don't want to do what it feels.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.560]   I want it to do as I feel, as I believe.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.620]   Surrender to the Spirit, right?
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.640]   And so I'm not just following those cravings.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.460]   Think about, hey, how do I kill comfort in my life
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.800]   so that I would replace the desire for comfort
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.480]   with the desire for discipline,
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.960]   that I would honor God in the grind?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.320]   Because the cause of laziness is a craving for comfort.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.160]   The cost of laziness is a wasted life.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.820]   And the cure for laziness is discipline.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.040]   First Timothy four, verse seven says
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.960]   that we're to discipline ourself
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.080]   for the purpose of godliness.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.100]   And so if you're here and you're like,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.560]   I want to be godly, what that scripture is saying
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.800]   is that you literally, that you can become godly
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.680]   through discipline.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.800]   It says it right there in the scripture
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.920]   that godliness comes by way of discipline.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.200]   Not easy, not just because you feel like it,
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.720]   that sometimes you have to honor God in the grind.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.520]   And you want to know the truth about me
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.040]   when it comes to drums?
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.160]   I ain't great.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.760]   I'm not a great drummer, percussionist, if you will.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.240]   Like I could come up here and do my very best
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.200]   and try to fake it.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.820]   I'd love to invite my friend Justin up here.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.040]   (drumming)
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.200]   (cymbal crashing)
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.240]   That just happened.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.560]   That's as good as I got.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.380]   Why?
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.840]   I never practiced, I never disciplined myself.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.360]   Justin, you've been playing the drum for what, 23 years?
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.640]   I just stepped on your tambourine, bro, I'm sorry.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.200]   23, Justin and I have been at the porch
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.120]   since the very beginning.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.240]   He's been a part of the porch band.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.160]   And the dude could play the drum.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.320]   Can you play the drums?
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.360]   Play the drums for him.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.620]   (drumming)
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.480]   (cymbal crashing)
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.400]   Yeah, that's like,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.600]   (audience cheering)
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.440]   it's like,
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.800]   just like I did.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:55.240]   'Cause I can hit those things with sticks.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.740]   But I can't make it beautiful.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.480]   I can't make it in beat.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.000]   To do that takes control, it takes discipline.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.760]   If you know anybody that's going to do something great
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.720]   with their life,
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.760]   they're either part of the less than 1%,
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.560]   or they discipline themselves.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.820]   And when it got hard, they pressed in.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.800]   And they said, "Lord, I don't want to do this,
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.600]   "but not my will, thy will.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.780]   "What would you have me do?
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.120]   "How would you use my life?"
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.280]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.480]   God, thank you for our friends that are here.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.120]   And just the truth in the scriptures
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.360]   is these practical life lessons
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.520]   that can feel a little bit like tips and tricks
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.640]   to living life.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.200]   But the truth is you've called us
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.320]   to discipline ourself for godliness.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.080]   And God, some of us, and I'll start with me,
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.280]   I need to confess the sin of laziness.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.760]   I don't like it when my wife leaves a list for me to do.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.500]   I've got a bunch of tasks, and I love to sleep in, God.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.680]   I really, I love to do what I want to do.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.180]   I love to feed my flesh.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:17.100]   And God, I acknowledge that's not gonna produce greatness,
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.660]   an act of worship for you.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.780]   And so, Lord, I want to present,
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.020]   we want to present our bodies as living sacrifices.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.020]   Would you see them as holy and pleasing?
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:32.140]   That this would be our spiritual act of worship.
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.060]   Father, help us not to conform any longer
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.740]   to the patterns of this world.
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.180]   We got to help us to be transformed
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.780]   by the renewing of our mind,
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.300]   that we might be able to test and approve what your will is,
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   your good, pleasing, and perfect will.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:49.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
