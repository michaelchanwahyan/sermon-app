00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:22,780
 All right.

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,560
 Well, hey, welcome everybody in the room

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,000
 and everybody tuning in from wherever you are.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,360
 Get excited.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,400
 We've got two new locations launching tonight.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,000
 Lafayette, Louisiana is launching

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,800
 in the second Indianapolis location,

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
 because Indianapolis is growing so fast.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,760
 And so to those welcome in every other PortsLive location

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
 and everybody in the room, we are

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,160
 kicking off a dating series.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,440
 It is about to get real, people.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,040
 And my hope-- I'll just be up front--

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,440
 I hope as many of you as possible

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,120
 start dating and get married because of this series.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,280
 And so I'm like, I am this close to making a Ports dating app.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:19,240
 And that's not true, and the liability would be terrible.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,920
 So let me start by giving us some tracks for where

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
 we're going to go as we walk through this series

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,880
 on Datable.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,120
 And that really is our heart.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,680
 And our heart also is to not see anybody date and get married

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,000
 that is not doing so in a way that would honor God

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,800
 or with someone that is not the type of person

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,040
 that God wants them to be with.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,160
 But let me start like this.

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
 A few months ago, I was out--

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,280
 and I shared before--

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,760
 I was out longboarding with my son, which clearly I'm

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,600
 too old to do.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
 Fell down, broke my hand, fractured it, went to the doctor,

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,960
 said they got to get surgery.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,720
 And this was--

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
 I hadn't had a surgery like this in a while.

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,680
 And because COVID, there was all kinds of new restrictions

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
 and checklist stuff that I had to do in order

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
 to get the surgery.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,920
 So she said, we need to have the surgery this week.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
 So over the next four days, I'm going

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
 to give you a checklist of things that you need to do.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,400
 And that includes every single day,

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
 you've got to take your temperature two different

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,360
 times.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
 You've got to go to this specific location

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,000
 and get tested to make sure that we get the results back

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 from the PCR test beforehand.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,760
 And then the day before, there's a whole checklist

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,080
 of certain things that you can eat and you can't eat,

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,840
 and time that you have to have before or from your last meal

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,600
 into the surgery.

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,080
 And so she said, you can't have anything after 8 PM.

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
 And make sure that you don't have anything that morning.

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,720
 Surgery was around early afternoon the next day.

55
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,600
 And I'm walking through this, and she's going,

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,920
 follow each of these checklists.

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,520
 And I'm like, you can't drink anything.

58
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,440
 And immediately, you know when you don't really

59
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,160
 care about having water in the morning,

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,800
 and then somebody tells you you can't have water for 12 hours,

61
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,840
 and you begin to get thirsty right there.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,000
 You're like, how am I going to go for that long without water?

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,680
 Like, I can't take a sip of water?

64
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,720
 What's going to happen if I take a sip of water?

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
 And she begins to explain the anesthesia,

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,320
 if you have anything in your system, it can come back.

67
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,720
 And I'm like, what's the worst that could possibly happen?

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,800
 She says, we won't do the surgery, sir.

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,840
 And explains that if you were to do that,

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,720
 and you had something in your system,

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,920
 because all of your organs are put to sleep,

72
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,720
 it can have real complications that lead to death,

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,760
 which feels extreme for a glass of water.

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,640
 But it's what I was told.

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,120
 And so she said, make sure you follow this checklist.

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
 If not, you will not be having surgery,

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,200
 because you will not be ready to have surgery,

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,760
 and we will have to reschedule your surgery.

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,800
 Now, what does that have to do with dating?

80
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,080
 Well, when it comes to the topic of dating,

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,240
 the Bible, surprise, doesn't talk about it,

82
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,360
 because dating has not been around for very long.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,440
 It's a relatively new invention, around 100 years.

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,000
 But the Bible has a lot to say about the topics of romance,

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 marriage, sex, evaluation, decision-making.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,560
 And so when we do a series like this,

87
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,320
 our heart really is to take God's word and equip you

88
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,780
 and prepare you to be dateable,

89
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,560
 to be someone who is ready not just to date

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,920
 like the world and culture around us says,

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,160
 but to date in line with God's word,

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,680
 who he says and as he says.

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,800
 And so tonight, I wanna walk through a checklist

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
 of not to prepare you for surgery,

95
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
 but to prepare you for dating.

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,200
 And the subject of this evening is, are you dateable?

97
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,960
 Now, that's a question you probably have never asked yourself

98
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,640
 but it's a really important question,

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,600
 'cause the world around you is just gonna say,

100
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,420
 are you dateable?

101
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,460
 If you're available, you're dateable.

102
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,800
 But the Bible would say,

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,700
 because you're dealing with the subject of your heart,

104
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,680
 of another person's heart,

105
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,480
 of the person who's gonna be a spouse,

106
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,300
 a relationship that is meant to be till death do you part,

107
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,800
 you need to make sure you go into that

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,360
 prepared and ready to date.

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
 Aside from deciding to follow Jesus,

110
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
 the most important decision you're gonna make

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,920
 is who your spouse is.

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,360
 There's a lot of decisions you're gonna make,

113
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
 you may put pressure on yourself,

114
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,320
 should I go to grad school,

115
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,580
 should I not move to this town,

116
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,680
 should I move over here,

117
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,440
 should I move out of this apartment?

118
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
 Those are important decisions,

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,920
 but there really is not many things in life

120
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,680
 that you can't undo,

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,680
 or that are decisions that you could change jobs

122
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,040
 and change careers, change industries,

123
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,560
 and then change back, you can undo it.

124
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,500
 There's some things that are very, very costly to undo.

125
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,440
 One of them is marriage.

126
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,480
 80% of you will get married statistically by age 35,

127
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,600
 which means when you combine that

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,520
 with the average age of getting married

129
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,800
 is around 29 and 30,

130
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
 the vast majority of you in the room will be married

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360
 and making the single most important decision

132
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,640
 next following Jesus that you will make in your life

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,160
 in the next seven years, five to seven years.

134
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,120
 I mean, think about the impact that your parents

135
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,120
 and them deciding to get married had on your life.

136
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
 I mean, you are picking your family.

137
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,800
 People say you pick your friends, can't pick your family.

138
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,640
 That's not true.

139
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
 You will pick your family

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,900
 because you are picking who will be the mother

141
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,740
 of your children.

142
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,360
 You are picking who will be the father of your children.

143
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,040
 You're picking the person

144
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,120
 who you're gonna spend more time with

145
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,160
 than any other person on the planet.

146
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,620
 And so when we come into this thing called dating,

147
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,160
 we need to make sure that we are ready to date

148
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,520
 to put ourself in the best scenario possible

149
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,320
 to find the right person, to date in the right way.

150
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,940
 So tonight I wanna walk through a checklist

151
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,140
 of how you can know, am I dateable?

152
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,560
 And be equipped and prepared.

153
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,320
 And to also know, if I discover I'm not,

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,880
 practical things that God would say,

155
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
 here are steps that are gonna set you up

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
 to experience the best marriage someday

157
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,280
 in dating pursuit today or someday.

158
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
 So we're gonna walk through and look at five different things.

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
 We're gonna jump through scripture

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,640
 and look at five different marks of the checklist,

161
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
 the things that if you are interested in dating,

162
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,180
 you need to make sure you have checked off the list.

163
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,640
 Five different aspects of the checklist of am I dateable?

164
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,580
 Am I ready to date?

165
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,800
 Not will somebody ask me on a date?

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,280
 Not could I go on a date?

167
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,240
 Not am I dating anyone?

168
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,960
 But am I dateable and in a spot

169
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,360
 where it would be wise for me to continue going?

170
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,680
 So first idea I wanna walk through

171
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,920
 as we look through these five is number one.

172
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,900
 First thing to check is check your preparation.

173
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,520
 In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul lays out

174
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,040
 that this is a season, singleness.

175
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,760
 If you're single, which most of us are in the room,

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,480
 this is a season that is given by God uniquely

177
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,080
 to do a couple things.

178
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,440
 And it's a season that is preparing you to become

179
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,520
 the husband, the father, the mother, the wife

180
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,820
 that you are going to be someday.

181
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,800
 You are becoming that right now.

182
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,080
 And it's a season where you can use it to prepare.

183
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,520
 1 Corinthians 7, verse seven says this, Paul speaking,

184
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
 "I wish everyone was single as I am.

185
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,260
 "Yet each person has a special gift from God

186
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,200
 "of one kind or another."

187
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,720
 Paul says, he's talking about singleness.

188
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,040
 Hey, I wish everybody was single like I am.

189
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,420
 In the context, he's saying so that they could,

190
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,080
 with all of their life, devote to sharing

191
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
 the gospel around them.

192
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,820
 And he says, hey, I've got my gift.

193
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,660
 I know everybody.

194
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,800
 I'm not saying everyone has to be single.

195
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,200
 I wish everybody was because then the gospel

196
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,920
 could move further and faster.

197
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,080
 But he says, everybody has different gifts.

198
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,920
 And this is my gift.

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,800
 And Paul describes singleness as a gift,

200
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
 which most of us in the room, or a lot of us,

201
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,040
 would be like, if this is a gift,

202
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,560
 I would like to explore a return policy.

203
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
 But Paul is saying it's a gift.

204
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,440
 And later in the chapter, he explains,

205
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,720
 here's why it's a gift.

206
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,080
 It's a unique season that you have.

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,860
 And he explains that in verse 35.

208
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,520
 "This I say for your own benefit,

209
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,940
 "not to put a restraint on you,

210
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,680
 "but to promote in singleness what is appropriate,

211
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,340
 "or appropriate behavior,

212
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,680
 "and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord."

213
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,640
 Paul says, hey, you have a season of singleness

214
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,200
 that for most of you, like I already said,

215
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,440
 80% of you will get married.

216
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,660
 Which means it is a season.

217
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,540
 And Paul said, this is a season

218
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,800
 that provides you the opportunity to produce,

219
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,660
 or have God produce in you appropriate behavior,

220
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,840
 and secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.

221
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,720
 In other words, to use to prepare you

222
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,200
 for whatever God has ahead in your story,

223
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,280
 and to prepare you for marriage,

224
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,880
 to prepare you for what someday,

225
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,360
 that relationship with husband, wife,

226
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
 that you are going to be.

227
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
 So what does it look like to prepare?

228
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,360
 Well, it involves promoting appropriate behavior,

229
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,560
 would be one of the things that Paul says.

230
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,600
 What does that look like?

231
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,840
 Here's three different things that it looks like.

232
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,320
 The first one, it means in this season,

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,880
 I'm gonna prioritize if I'm single.

234
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,200
 I'm prioritizing my relationship with Jesus.

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,020
 He just said, you have a unique season

236
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,200
 that will allow you to secure undistracted

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,320
 devotion to the Lord.

238
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,060
 It will allow you to deepen in your relationship with God.

239
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,660
 The season you're in is a unique one

240
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,240
 that you will never have again,

241
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,200
 or hopefully will never have again,

242
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,520
 because you have a chance to spend more time

243
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,200
 prioritizing your relationship with God,

244
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,680
 studying God's word in the morning,

245
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,880
 and kids are not crying, coming to you saying,

246
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,720
 I need some milk, or breakfast, or Capri Sun,

247
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,800
 or just screaming their heads off

248
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,940
 'cause their pacifier is out.

249
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,720
 You can wake up, you can have a quiet time.

250
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,940
 You can go on mission trips.

251
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,600
 You can spend weekends serving and knowing God,

252
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,020
 and deepening in your faith, and building a foundation

253
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,960
 that you're gonna build a marriage and a life on

254
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,120
 for the rest of the rest.

255
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,380
 How do you promote what is wise?

256
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,520
 What is the best way to prepare in this season?

257
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,480
 It is to prioritize my relationship with Jesus.

258
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,200
 I'm gonna sow seeds that for the rest of my life,

259
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,360
 they're gonna be growing

260
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,960
 because of the way that I invested this time of singleness.

261
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,880
 You may not believe it.

262
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
 You may think you're busy.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,640
 You may think, man, I have so much going on.

264
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,320
 Wait until you are married and you have children.

265
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,840
 Whatever you think is busy, I look back and I'm like,

266
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,920
 what did I do with my life?

267
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,240
 (congregation laughing)

268
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,000
 And it sounds crazy, and I sat in a room like this,

269
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,520
 and I would hear people say things like that,

270
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,320
 of this is a unique time where you're gonna have

271
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,960
 more disposable time than any other,

272
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
 and I would go, man, you don't know me, bro.

273
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,200
 I'm so busy.

274
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
 And now I look back and I'm like,

275
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,020
 I should've, I was such an idiot.

276
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,920
 You have more time and availability to serve the Lord

277
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,280
 and to use it growing and prioritizing your relationship,

278
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,960
 which is a part of preparing you

279
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,780
 for a relationship with a spouse.

280
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,040
 In other words, you're not gonna get a relationship

281
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
 with a guy or girl right until you get

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,200
 the relationship with God right.

283
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,800
 Side note, on the question of, hey, am I dateable?

284
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,520
 If you are not a Christian, no,

285
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,320
 because you haven't gotten the relationship with God right,

286
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,420
 which should be the first priority.

287
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,320
 What does it mean to be a Christian?

288
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,280
 Quickly, it means accepting the gospel,

289
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,400
 which means good news, that Jesus came into the world

290
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
 2,000 years ago.

291
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
 He was God in human form.

292
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,360
 He died on a cross for your sin

293
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
 and a payment for your sin

294
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
 and every wrong that you've ever done.

295
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,960
 And by accepting God, I'm not good enough,

296
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,720
 but you paid for me on the cross.

297
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,200
 Through that, we're told, just like Jesus rose from the dead

298
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,600
 you will rise from the dead and have eternal life,

299
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,640
 a relationship with God.

300
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,160
 Those of us who are, this is the season

301
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,880
 where we prioritize getting to know him.

302
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,020
 What's the second part of preparing well in this season?

303
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,080
 Dealing with hurts.

304
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,640
 This is huge.

305
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,920
 Dealing with hurts.

306
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,440
 Is there anyone in your life who you haven't forgiven?

307
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,960
 Now, I'm sure if I heard your story, it would make sense

308
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,320
 and I would feel such empathy and compassion and hate it

309
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,160
 and you didn't deserve it and whatever happened.

310
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,400
 But if you carry bitterness, you are not ready to date

311
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,920
 because you're not ready to get married,

312
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,420
 which is what dating leads to.

313
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,040
 When I meet with couples and I do premarital counseling,

314
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,320
 for anybody whose wedding I'm gonna do,

315
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,640
 I ask a question every single time.

316
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
 Is there any, I ask this question,

317
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,600
 is there anyone in your life that you haven't forgiven?

318
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,400
 And oftentimes, they'll say, you know, my father,

319
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,820
 parent, somebody distant.

320
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,360
 And I'll look at them and as lovingly as I can,

321
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,260
 I say, I can't do your wedding unless you forgive them.

322
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,400
 Why would you be so mean, David?

323
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,380
 Well, the Bible says over and over

324
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,280
 that you and I as Christians, we are called to forgive

325
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,280
 as Christ forgives us over and over and over.

326
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,840
 I mean, one example is Colossians 3, 13.

327
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,220
 You can find it in Ephesians 4, Matthew 18,

328
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,700
 over the Lord's Prayer.

329
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,940
 But here it says, "Bear with each other

330
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,000
 "and forgive one another

331
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
 "if any of you has a grievance against someone.

332
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,160
 "Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

333
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,300
 You and I are called to forgive people.

334
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,140
 Why would it be bad to go into marriage

335
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,700
 and hold bitterness against somebody that's not my husband?

336
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,540
 I mean, I'm not marrying a family member that hurt me,

337
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,980
 I'm marrying him, I'm marrying her.

338
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,660
 Why is that bad?

339
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,340
 If you develop the habit of picking up hurts

340
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,140
 and holding onto them, hey, when I get hurt, I hold on.

341
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,500
 When I get hurt, I hold this bitterness,

342
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,260
 hold it against that person.

343
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,820
 Creates a wedge for me and that person.

344
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,340
 You are flexing the muscle of holding bitterness.

345
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,060
 In marriage, you are stepping into a relationship

346
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,220
 that is the most intimate relationship you're gonna have.

347
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,660
 And the deeper the intimacy in any relationship,

348
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,300
 the deeper the pain is when they hurt you.

349
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,420
 You're stepping into a relationship

350
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,660
 with another sinner just like you.

351
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,580
 And marriage, healthy marriages,

352
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
 are the process of choosing to forgive

353
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,060
 someone who deeply hurts you over and over and over,

354
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,580
 like Christ forgave us.

355
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,020
 Not to stay in an abusive environment,

356
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,780
 but to choose, I'm going to forgive this person.

357
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,400
 Billy Graham famously said when he was asked

358
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,460
 what makes a great marriage, he said, "Two great forgivers."

359
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,300
 And so if you have not dealt with hurts,

360
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,860
 the best way you can prepare in this season

361
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,740
 is to say, man, I'm gonna work through,

362
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,620
 I'm gonna choose to forgive people.

363
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,180
 I'm gonna work through that with my community,

364
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,100
 maybe through region.

365
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,780
 I'm gonna choose, I'm gonna sit down,

366
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,100
 I'm gonna forgive this person who really hurt me.

367
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,820
 A third way this season is one

368
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,620
 to uniquely prepare for marriage

369
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,020
 is to deal with toxic habits.

370
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,420
 Is there something in your life that you're thinking,

371
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,020
 man, when I get married, I'm sure this won't be a part of me,

372
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,900
 whether it's an eating disorder, maybe you're just a liar.

373
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,580
 Like you just, you lie about little things.

374
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,060
 You have never opened up.

375
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,160
 You lie to your community.

376
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,960
 You lie to the person you're dating.

377
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,100
 Is there something in your life that you need to confess

378
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,020
 and get rid of and say, man, I need to bring this

379
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,540
 into light, I just want to work on this.

380
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,100
 I don't want to be this person.

381
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,660
 Because marriage is not gonna make that change.

382
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,900
 It's not gonna make a porn addiction go away.

383
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,420
 It's not gonna make the eating disorder that you turn to

384
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,540
 when you're stressed go away.

385
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
 It'll just make it worse.

386
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,220
 What's gonna make it go away is when you decide,

387
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,980
 I'm going to confess and repent and work through this.

388
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,180
 I'm gonna decide to work through this.

389
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,440
 Maybe it's a gambling problem

390
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,580
 that you wouldn't even admit

391
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,060
 or you wouldn't even describe it that way,

392
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,260
 but you kind of just turn to it

393
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,160
 and it's your outlet and your release.

394
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,580
 What is the toxic habits that today

395
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,060
 you could decide I'm gonna give the gift to my spouse

396
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,820
 that I'm not carrying this into marriage.

397
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,420
 I'm not bringing this in and making it,

398
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,080
 it goes from my problem to our problem.

399
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,060
 I am dealing with this today

400
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,620
 because I'm choosing to prepare for marriage.

401
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,580
 You know, it's crazy when it comes to marriage,

402
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,880
 we believe it's like, it will magically change us.

403
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,100
 Man, I struggled with lust.

404
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,140
 That's just 'cause I was single.

405
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,280
 Then I got married, lust problem went away.

406
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,340
 Marriage doesn't change anything,

407
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,180
 but the fact that now you're married.

408
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,060
 In other words, it doesn't make your problems go away.

409
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,340
 It makes you have not single,

410
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,900
 being a single person in problems,

411
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,060
 now you're a married person with problems

412
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,220
 and somebody else is invited into those problems.

413
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,100
 It doesn't change.

414
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,500
 In other words, you put on a ring,

415
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,060
 stand in front, wear a white dress,

416
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,940
 the next day, nothing is different other than you're married.

417
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,480
 It'll change your last name.

418
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,780
 It won't change your toxic habits.

419
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,680
 But you can decide today, I'm gonna work on those.

420
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,280
 And you are deciding,

421
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,040
 am I gonna choose to prepare for marriage?

422
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
 I'm gonna work through hurts.

423
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,360
 I'm gonna work through toxic habits.

424
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,480
 I'm gonna prioritize my relationship with God

425
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,040
 and choose to prepare well.

426
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,700
 Or you can choose to not prepare.

427
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,360
 And you know what will happen when you get married?

428
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
 You won't be prepared.

429
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
 It's pretty profound.

430
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,820
 I'll say it again.

431
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,840
 If you choose not to prepare, you will get married

432
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,480
 and you won't be prepared for marriage.

433
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,280
 I don't know why anybody would think differently

434
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,480
 as though like, man, marriage,

435
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,200
 then I'll get serious about God and that's gonna change.

436
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,160
 It doesn't change anything except for your last name,

437
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,140
 potentially, and your relationship status.

438
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,040
 Like what other arena in life do we focus on,

439
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,040
 hey, I'll be able to have victory or accomplish this,

440
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,080
 not because I prepared or I practiced,

441
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,940
 just 'cause I promise I'll be able to.

442
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,000
 None.

443
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
 We know that it doesn't work that way in school or education

444
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,760
 if I promise like, oh, I'm gonna get great grades.

445
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,820
 You know what allows you to get great grades?

446
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,300
 Preparing.

447
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,760
 In business or sports, no one would say,

448
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,000
 hey, our team, we're gonna win

449
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
 a national championship this year

450
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,000
 because we're just gonna promise that we're gonna do it.

451
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,020
 No more practices, guys, just go to the locker room

452
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,840
 and promise national championship, national championship.

453
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,120
 It's a very fast way to lose your job if you're a head coach

454
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,840
 because we understand you could promise things all day,

455
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,240
 which is what saying I do is, a promise.

456
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,560
 Promises don't matter

457
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,680
 if they don't have preparation behind them.

458
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,460
 You are choosing today, am I gonna prepare

459
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,240
 to keep the promise, then I'm gonna make.

460
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,720
 Everybody intends and wants to keep their promise.

461
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,840
 I do, to the death's duest part.

462
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,080
 They just don't prepare.

463
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 And you can decide, I am going to choose to prepare.

464
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,400
 There's a passage related to this,

465
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
 and we'll go to the second one,

466
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,640
 on this idea of, I don't know where we buy the myth

467
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,880
 of like, man, marriage, I'll just wake up one day

468
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,980
 and I'll be different.

469
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,560
 There's a passage on love that you've probably heard

470
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,600
 if you've gone to a wedding before

471
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
 and heard somebody read before,

472
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
 or maybe you've read yourself before,

473
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
 and in the passage, he takes a very interesting term

474
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,420
 towards the end of it, it's the love chapter.

475
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,600
 You've heard people wonder, hey, is love a verb?

476
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,920
 Is it a noun?

477
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,320
 In this chapter, this is the love is a verb chapter.

478
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,560
 First Corinthians 13, Apostle Paul, he defines love.

479
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,620
 Look at the description that he says.

480
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,640
 He says, "Love is patient.

481
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,060
 "It's kind.

482
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,600
 "It doesn't envy.

483
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,120
 "It doesn't boast.

484
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
 "It's not proud.

485
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,180
 "It doesn't dishonor other people.

486
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,220
 "It's not self-seeking.

487
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,640
 "It's not easily angered.

488
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,800
 "It keeps no record of wrongs."

489
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,360
 This is Paul describing, how can you know

490
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,860
 that you're operating in love?

491
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,960
 "Love doesn't delight in evil, it rejoices in the truth.

492
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,800
 "It always protects.

493
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,040
 "It always trusts.

494
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,760
 "It always hopes and always perseveres."

495
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,120
 And then at the end of the section about love,

496
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,280
 the Apostle Paul does something that's really interesting

497
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,620
 and really, really relevant.

498
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,640
 He begins to talk about his childhood,

499
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,000
 where he's like, this is what love is, this is what love is,

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,120
 and he goes into, when I was a boy,

501
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,280
 and he begins to describe growing up, here's what he says.

502
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,480
 "When I was a child, I talked like a child.

503
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,320
 "I thought like a child, and I reasoned like a child.

504
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,520
 "Like, hey, when I was a little kid,

505
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,360
 "when I was a little boy,"

506
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,640
 this is Paul talking about himself,

507
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,040
 "when I was a little boy, I was like a kid.

508
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,880
 "I thought like a kid, thought like kids think.

509
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,280
 "And then, when I became a man,

510
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,400
 "I put the ways of childhood behind me."

511
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,520
 When we're kids, I am currently in a stage

512
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,360
 where my kids are young,

513
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,060
 and so you read books every night from bed,

514
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,440
 you're reading fairy tales to 'em,

515
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,520
 and when you're a kid, you think and believe fairy tales.

516
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,840
 You think those are true.

517
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,280
 You think, you know, someday, maybe I could fly someday,

518
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,440
 wouldn't that be amazing?

519
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
 The way that you think and see the world,

520
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,600
 you just are still, you're not old enough to understand.

521
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,960
 It's a fairy tale, it's a myth, it's not true.

522
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,320
 Some of us have bought fairy tales and myths

523
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,080
 about love and about marriage and about romance

524
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,080
 that you've never abandoned or recognized.

525
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,420
 That's a fairy tale.

526
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,320
 Happily Ever After, that's a fairy tale.

527
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,560
 That does not happen.

528
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,840
 What happens in marriage is two people come together

529
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,800
 and they work to love each other

530
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,880
 and die to themselves ever after.

531
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,520
 It's a much longer tagline than Happily Ever After,

532
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,480
 but it's a much more true tagline.

533
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,800
 Equally as true is a fairy tale

534
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 that marriage is gonna change and make your problems go away.

535
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,200
 Marriage doesn't make your problems go away.

536
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,580
 Deciding I'm gonna prepare for marriage

537
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,280
 is how you and I work through the problems

538
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,580
 that one day are gonna attempt to get in your way

539
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,760
 of that relationship with the other person.

540
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,040
 How are you preparing in this season?

541
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,320
 If you're not preparing well, you are not dateable.

542
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,600
 Second idea, check your pattern.

543
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,600
 So check your pattern, check your preparation,

544
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,120
 check your pattern.

545
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,940
 What is a pattern?

546
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,580
 You have a past, you have a pattern of dating.

547
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,900
 If you dated anybody, you likely have,

548
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,700
 or you do have a pattern.

549
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,200
 We all have 'em and there's certain things

550
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,680
 just from our past that we gravitate towards.

551
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,000
 What is the patterns of your life,

552
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,540
 of your dating relationships?

553
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,360
 The different ways that you end up in dysfunctional,

554
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,320
 messed up relationships, the cycles

555
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,720
 that are part of your love life story.

556
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
 In Proverbs chapter 14, verse 15, it says,

557
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
 "The simple believe anything,

558
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,240
 "but a wise person or a prudent

559
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,800
 "gives thoughts to their steps."

560
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,900
 What is your pattern?

561
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,700
 Do you know it?

562
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,700
 Because if you don't accept it, you can't address it.

563
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,460
 Do you know, what is your pattern of dating?

564
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,520
 Here's something I wrote.

565
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,260
 Some of you only date passive men

566
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,580
 because your dad was controlling.

567
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,540
 And so now you think, I so did not like that.

568
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,540
 I want someone who's passive,

569
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,100
 who I'm kind of the boss in this relationship.

570
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,460
 Or your dad was passive, and so you're looking

571
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,480
 for someone that is passive,

572
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,460
 which is not coming out of a healthy

573
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,180
 place, but a broken place.

574
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,720
 You're looking for qualities and characteristics

575
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,760
 that are not the ones God says to look for.

576
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,440
 Some of you, you don't like being in a relationship

577
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
 with somebody if the other person,

578
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,880
 or if you like the other person more than they like you.

579
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,800
 In other words, you're comfortable

580
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,520
 in a dating relationship, and you'll continue

581
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,920
 in the dating relationship as long as they like you

582
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,000
 more than you like them.

583
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,840
 Do you know why?

584
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,400
 Because you're afraid of rejection.

585
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,640
 And it allows you to have some semblance of control

586
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,440
 of man, I know that this girl's so into me,

587
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,640
 or he's so into me that I can decide

588
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,760
 if I ever wanna walk away, 'cause she never will.

589
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,280
 And you know why?

590
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,480
 It's because you're afraid of rejection.

591
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,480
 You're operating from fear, not from a healthy place.

592
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,520
 We all have patterns.

593
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,880
 Some of you, candidly, girls, you've stayed

594
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,280
 in relationships in your past way too long.

595
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,000
 And you took behavior that was not just rude,

596
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 it was borderline abusive, harsh, mean,

597
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,200
 and you took it, and you allowed other people

598
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,660
 to treat badly because you thought badly of yourself.

599
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,900
 And there's a pattern there, that hey,

600
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,100
 you're gonna be prone to do that.

601
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,780
 And unless you say, man, I need to evaluate

602
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,880
 all the different broken patterns that are in my life.

603
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,960
 If I'm gonna change them, I can't address

604
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,460
 what I haven't accepted is there.

605
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,760
 Some of you, you get in a relationship,

606
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,800
 and I just want you to think about this,

607
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,760
 'cause this is a very common one.

608
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
 You get in a relationship and you start dating somebody.

609
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 Like, it's going great, she's a cute girl.

610
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,160
 I'm gonna talk to the guys here for a second.

611
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,640
 This feels like a guy thing.

612
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,160
 She's a cute girl, man, I'm interested in dating her.

613
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,080
 You go on one date, things are good.

614
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,520
 You know, I just didn't feel all the sparks flying,

615
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,320
 but she seems nice, and she's a cute girl,

616
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,560
 and she checks the box on all the qualities that I want.

617
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,400
 I'll go on a second date.

618
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,920
 Go on a second date, yeah, same thing.

619
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,240
 I'm just not really feeling it.

620
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,400
 Third date, you kind of get a few dates in.

621
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,320
 And you begin to go, I mean, everything on paper's great.

622
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,580
 I just don't know if I'm feeling it,

623
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,000
 or if I want to date her.

624
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
 Let me ask you a question.

625
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,720
 There's so many baked in assumptions

626
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,900
 in your decision to break up with that person.

627
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,700
 I'm not even telling you it's wrong, but just stay with me.

628
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,700
 I'm going on a very narrow path to take you somewhere, okay?

629
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,680
 In that moment, you are assuming

630
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,240
 that I should have some level of fireworks,

631
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,200
 whatever that means,

632
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,380
 and a feeling of emotion towards this person.

633
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,200
 If I was to ask you to write out

634
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,720
 what would fireworks look like,

635
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,840
 you wouldn't say fireworks.

636
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,000
 You would say, I don't know,

637
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,960
 like some butterflies or something in there,

638
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,400
 and you would struggle to articulate

639
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,720
 what you were deeming a criteria for a relationship

640
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
 that must take place.

641
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
 I'm not even saying you're wrong or in sin.

642
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,400
 I'm just saying you owe it to yourself

643
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,600
 to at least say, huh, I can't even tell myself

644
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
 why I don't want to keep dating this girl

645
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,120
 that's perfect on paper,

646
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,920
 and Jesus says would be a great wife.

647
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,440
 Something to think about.

648
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,960
 (congregation laughing)

649
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,580
 Something to think about.

650
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,680
 I don't know what your pattern is,

651
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,800
 but I know if you have any level of dating relationship,

652
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
 you have one.

653
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,300
 And in order to address it,

654
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,200
 you gotta first identify it and accept,

655
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
 like hey, this is my tendency.

656
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,360
 And then you bring it into other guys

657
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,640
 or girls in your life and community.

658
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,760
 You're like, hey, this is my tendency.

659
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,480
 I get kind of far in,

660
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,320
 and then I'm like, man, I'm just afraid.

661
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,360
 I kind of have the commitment fear, so I'm out.

662
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
 And so you gotta bring that to other guys in your life,

663
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,720
 your guy, other girls in your life.

664
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,800
 You gotta talk about it and say, hey, here's my temptation.

665
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,680
 This is my ditch.

666
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
 Hold me accountable.

667
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,020
 'Cause if not, that pattern ain't going away.

668
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,680
 So flip golf carts from time to time,

669
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
 and we'll buy a golf cart, try to trick it out,

670
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,200
 and sell it and not lose money.

671
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,280
 Not long ago, I bought one, and the alignment was off.

672
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,120
 And by alignment, alignment is the thing

673
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,320
 that allows you to drive straight.

674
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,440
 If the alignment is off, you'll start driving,

675
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,600
 and it'll just immediately go to the right.

676
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,780
 So the alignment was totally off.

677
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,120
 So every time I got in the car,

678
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
 I had to compensate by pulling the steering wheel

679
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,100
 way far over in order for it to drive straight.

680
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,160
 Because on its own, it was just gonna keep going

681
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,560
 in that direction, 'cause its alignment was off.

682
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:17,680
 If you don't identify, hey, I got an alignment that's off.

683
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,320
 This is just where I go in isolation, in neutral.

684
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,560
 I just drift towards.

685
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,480
 Man, I get in, things are going well,

686
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,120
 and I get deuces 'cause I get nervous,

687
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,400
 and I've never even told anybody that,

688
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,120
 but I just have some relationship problems,

689
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,000
 or I get in the relationship, and I allow myself,

690
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,560
 because I don't wanna lose the other person,

691
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,800
 to go farther physically than God's word says.

692
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,900
 I need some help and accountability there.

693
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,400
 If you don't begin to work on those patterns,

694
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,560
 they're not going away.

695
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,760
 They're just gonna continue, continue,

696
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,560
 and continue resurfacing.

697
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,280
 I hear from girls all the time.

698
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,680
 Now I'm leaning into the girls.

699
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,920
 Why are guys just such jerks?

700
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,280
 Every guy in the world, he's either a jerk,

701
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,720
 or he's totally unattractive.

702
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
 This is who they are.

703
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,160
 (congregation laughing)

704
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,000
 It's true.

705
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,640
 It's true.

706
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,040
 Here's something I want you to consider.

707
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,880
 Stay with me.

708
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,700
 Wait right here.

709
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,960
 In those conversations, they always go one way of like,

710
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,920
 hey, tell me about who you're dating, and she'll describe.

711
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,600
 He was just such a jerk, and he was just such a jerk,

712
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,000
 and he was just such a jerk.

713
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,120
 Could it be that it's not that the world

714
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,960
 is as simple as unattractive or jerk,

715
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,520
 but that you are only attracted to jerks?

716
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,920
 Hold on.

717
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,520
 Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

718
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,440
 Yeah, bring it up.

719
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,560
 That's good.

720
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,920
 Good night, everybody!

721
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,240
 (congregation laughing)

722
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
 Here's why I say that.

723
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,320
 You had jerk John, jerk Jerry, jerk Mark.

724
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,320
 You had dating relationships with all of them.

725
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,160
 Who is the common denominator in all those relationships?

726
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,100
 You.

727
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,160
 I'm not trying to pick on you.

728
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
 I'm saying, could it be that there is something

729
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,240
 dysfunctional in you that is drawn to someone like that?

730
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,160
 I don't know what it is, but I know you gotta get down.

731
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,800
 What are the dysfunction of my dating pattern and past?

732
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,240
 Because a dysfunctional pattern reveals or reflects

733
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,080
 a dysfunctional personal issue

734
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,560
 that you gotta get to the root of,

735
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,880
 have communities begin to, and work through.

736
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,200
 If you have not worked through,

737
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,440
 and you don't even know your pattern,

738
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,240
 you may not be dateable,

739
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,340
 but you need to prioritize working through that.

740
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,640
 Speaking of priorities, third idea is you need

741
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,600
 to check your priorities.

742
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
 I'm gonna move quickly through this one,

743
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,440
 that you, as a believer, what are the priorities?

744
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,120
 What are the things, if you were to put a list together,

745
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,760
 and I could give you a piece of paper right now,

746
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,720
 if I was sitting down with you, and I was like,

747
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,800
 hey, write on paper everything you want in a spouse,

748
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
 or everything in the person you wanna date,

749
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,800
 hopefully marry someday, write 'em out.

750
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,240
 And you know what your list would include?

751
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,240
 It would include things like, I want him to be witty,

752
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,680
 'cause you know, I'm not that witty,

753
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,920
 and I just like a little personality, and I,

754
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,680
 he's gotta be 6'2" or taller, 'cause I'm 5'9",

755
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,220
 and I like to wear heels, okay?

756
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,440
 And you could list out all the things,

757
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
 or you go, I want her to be a blonde,

758
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,920
 or I want her to be a little reserved,

759
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,120
 'cause I'm not outgoing, or I like someone who,

760
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,520
 you know, is kinda go with the flow,

761
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,600
 'cause I'm pretty buttoned up,

762
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,760
 and you could give me your list.

763
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,880
 It's fine, you could have a list.

764
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,820
 Make the priorities of the top parts of your list

765
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,080
 the right ones, because all of the other ones,

766
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,840
 I have never heard, I've never heard,

767
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,600
 I've been doing this a long time,

768
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,200
 a couple get divorced because he wasn't witty enough.

769
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,880
 (congregation laughs)

770
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 But I've heard over and over,

771
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,680
 their relationship fall apart, because he was selfish,

772
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,300
 she was emotionally abusive or absent.

773
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,720
 And so you gotta make sure, what are the priorities?

774
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,680
 Like, these are the must-have non-negotiables.

775
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,200
 Let me give you an example of a top priorities

776
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
 of somebody that you are not dateable.

777
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,740
 We love you, we are glad you're here,

778
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,000
 you just need to work and meet with Jesus more

779
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,040
 in order to get ready to date.

780
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,840
 Here's not dateable list of somebody.

781
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,360
 Here's on the not dateable priorities.

782
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,600
 If these are your top priorities, you are not dateable.

783
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,440
 Hot.

784
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,680
 (congregation laughs)

785
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,680
 Witty, high salary, outgoing, nice car.

786
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,640
 (congregation laughs)

787
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,840
 On the dateable list, Jesus is their first love.

788
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,960
 If the priorities in your life,

789
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,180
 if Jesus is their first love,

790
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,520
 they are a member of a church,

791
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,880
 they're connected to a local church.

792
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
 In other words, they look at God's word,

793
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
 and it says, you and I are to be underneath,

794
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,900
 connected to a local church,

795
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,320
 they actually listen and obey that,

796
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,000
 which tells you that they're actually gonna listen and obey

797
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,960
 the other commands in scripture

798
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,080
 about how they're to raise babies,

799
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,060
 how they're to be a husband or wife.

800
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,640
 They're humble, they're teacher.

801
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,440
 This one is so huge.

802
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,080
 When they're confronted with something, they're teachable.

803
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,120
 They'll ask for forgiveness.

804
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,280
 They're not perfect.

805
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,920
 And you point out ways that they're not perfect,

806
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,960
 you go, I'm trying to work on that area,

807
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,100
 or thank you, will you please forgive me?

808
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,940
 They're humble.

809
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,700
 They have strong character.

810
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,700
 And they value marriage.

811
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,960
 They value marriage the way God said,

812
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,620
 it is a lifelong covenant relationship together.

813
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,560
 They have character.

814
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,580
 In Proverbs chapter 12, verse four, it says,

815
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,580
 a spouse or wife or husband of noble character

816
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,400
 is her husband's crown.

817
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,600
 But a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.

818
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,780
 What is the author saying there?

819
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,380
 He says, it's like, the crown is the most prized possession.

820
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,700
 A wife or husband of noble character

821
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,200
 is like their spouses, this is my prized possession.

822
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,280
 But one who is not, who doesn't have character,

823
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,780
 it's like it's rotting them from the inside.

824
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,220
 It's pretty powerful.

825
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,320
 And the author says, man, you need to be so careful

826
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,700
 when you find someone of character.

827
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,740
 It's weird, man, we prioritize the outside.

828
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,780
 That's what attracts us to people,

829
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,080
 we end up dating 'cause it's like the outside.

830
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,220
 When the inside is the only thing that's sticking around.

831
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,940
 In other words, the outside,

832
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,260
 whatever they look like right now,

833
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,540
 it's not gonna look like what they look like in 20 years.

834
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,020
 Hair will move from here to other places.

835
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,740
 Stretch marks are gonna happen,

836
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,220
 just bodies are gonna change, wrinkles are gonna happen,

837
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,360
 no matter how much Botox they spray up, it's gonna happen.

838
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,580
 Or inject, whatever it is.

839
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,700
 (congregation laughing)

840
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,660
 Spray up.

841
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:42,440
 The outside is going away, the inside is here to stay.

842
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,860
 And we prioritize, there's so many of the wrong things.

843
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,180
 Are there so many that will love you,

844
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,860
 like Ephesians 5 says, husbands love your wife

845
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,780
 like Christ loved the church,

846
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,180
 and that he laid down his life for her.

847
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,740
 Or Husbands in Colossians 3,

848
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,780
 love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

849
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,380
 Sometimes even the thing that is on the top priority

850
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,700
 is how we feel, which is a really dangerous thing.

851
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,820
 Let me wrap this point up quickly.

852
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,700
 Because you know where your feelings come from?

853
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,460
 They come from what the Bible would say is the heart.

854
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:22,980
 And the heart can be really, really deceitful.

855
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,980
 In other words, following your feelings

856
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,980
 is putting your life in the hands of something

857
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,260
 the Bible doesn't speak that well of

858
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,780
 when it comes to its ability to deceive.

859
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,700
 It says this, Jeremiah chapter 17, verse nine.

860
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,900
 Think about this verse.

861
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,140
 The heart is deceitful above all things

862
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,040
 and beyond cure or utterly sick.

863
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,260
 And Jeremiah writes, and he says,

864
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,260
 "The heart has the ability to deceive oneself

865
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,060
 "more than anything else in all of creation."

866
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,220
 It's pretty shocking.

867
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,940
 This is why just following blindly the feelings

868
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,940
 and emotions that you have is a bad idea biblically,

869
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,340
 because you may love him,

870
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,740
 and you guys are infatuated together,

871
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,900
 and you're obsessed, and you got a song,

872
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,780
 and you got just dreams of all the visions

873
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,200
 of someday your home and little babies.

874
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,520
 But if he's not a believer, you have deceived yourself.

875
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,560
 And is it possible to fall in love

876
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,040
 with someone who's not a Christian if you're a Christian?

877
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,680
 Absolutely.

878
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,240
 All you gotta have to fall in love is be breathing,

879
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,440
 and then be breathing, period.

880
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,280
 Staying in love is a much harder thing,

881
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 and that requires sharing the same priority

882
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
 of Jesus in your life.

883
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
 He's your first love and their first love.

884
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,760
 And so if your priorities and what you're looking for

885
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,560
 are not shaped by that, which is really hard,

886
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,920
 'cause candidly, a lot of you guys,

887
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
 you would say, "Yes, they are that."

888
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,300
 But you got deal breakers.

889
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,000
 You say, "I'm not dating somebody shorter than me.

890
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,240
 "I'm not dating a girl that has that much debt.

891
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,300
 "I'm not dating somebody that wants to keep working

892
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,720
 "or wants to not work."

893
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,580
 And so you owe it to yourself to just say,

894
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,980
 "Here are my deal breakers."

895
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,280
 Say, "God, will you help me prioritize what you prioritize?"

896
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,200
 After you've checked your pattern, your priorities,

897
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,200
 and your preparation, the final thing is check your people.

898
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,080
 Do you have believers in your life,

899
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,080
 a support system around you

900
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,960
 that is gonna be able to speak into in a godly way

901
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,360
 people that love you, that are for you?

902
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,120
 They're not just gonna tell you the relationship is great

903
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,040
 because they don't wanna hurt your feelings.

904
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,180
 They're willing to tell you the truth,

905
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,240
 and they come along and they wanna celebrate

906
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,480
 and see you as somebody godly.

907
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,520
 Do you have a community group, a small group?

908
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,320
 You need to check your people

909
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,560
 and make sure that they are the right people.

910
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,800
 In order that you would have wise counsel,

911
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,400
 see the relationship succeed, Proverbs 24, verse six says,

912
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,980
 "By wise guidance, you can wage war,

913
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,240
 "and in abundance of counselors, there is victory."

914
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,080
 Other Proverbs say that plans fail because lack of counsel.

915
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,420
 Counselor call out, that they would say

916
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,000
 if they thought the relationship was not healthy,

917
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,660
 what so many people who got married and ended up divorced

918
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,960
 didn't have people to say.

919
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,580
 Most people that are in a toxic relationship,

920
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,700
 if they're around anybody who's not toxic,

921
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,540
 they can go, "That's pretty toxic.

922
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,260
 "You guys are really unhealthy and codependent and messed up.

923
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
 "And we need people in our life

924
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,940
 "that are willing to speak the truth and love

925
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,300
 "because they love us."

926
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,120
 In Hebrews chapter three, verse 14, or 12 through 13,

927
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,760
 it says, "See to it that none of you

928
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,040
 "has a sinful, unbelieving heart

929
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,160
 "that turns away from the living God,

930
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,920
 "but encourage or call out one another daily,

931
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,600
 "as long as it is called today,

932
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,320
 "so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

933
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,440
 They're willing to speak in and give counsel.

934
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,520
 They're also willing to come along and celebrate.

935
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,400
 This is a good thing.

936
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,240
 Song of Solomon, chapter one, verse four,

937
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,440
 and throughout the book, talks about this couple

938
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,000
 that had friends that looked on and they said,

939
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,220
 "We celebrate this relationship."

940
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,060
 It's an amazing thing.

941
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,080
 "You guys should date and be in relationship together.

942
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,800
 "Do you have believers in your life

943
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,840
 "who are coming alongside of you

944
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
 "that can speak the truth,

945
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,020
 "that will give you their honest thoughts,

946
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,340
 "that will counsel you?

947
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:30,280
 "Because if not, you are going into deciding

948
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,420
 "one of the most important things in your life all alone."

949
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,300
 Proverbs 18, verse one says,

950
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,180
 "Whoever isolates himself," or lives in isolation,

951
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,860
 dates in isolation, "seeks his own desires.

952
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,860
 "He breaks out against all sound judgment."

953
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,540
 He fights against all sound judgment.

954
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,860
 "He excuses and rationalized, dismisses red flags."

955
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,000
 That's what that means.

956
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,940
 He tries to make excuses for, she makes excuses for,

957
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,220
 tries to overlook it.

958
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,380
 Because we're in love and people in their life

959
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,580
 that could have been a source of protection

960
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,180
 at a time when that relationship ending is still painful,

961
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,100
 but it is far less painful than we got a two-year-old

962
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,620
 and you got to move out into an apartment.

963
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,380
 And I love you and I have seen it too many times

964
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,980
 and I have nothing but a vested interest

965
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,860
 in you having an amazing marriage.

966
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,820
 But do you have a support system?

967
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,940
 Do you have your people that are coming around you

968
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,140
 and calling you out and speaking to you?

969
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,780
 This was huge even in my own dating relationship

970
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,580
 with my wife where we were dating

971
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,500
 and there's just times where we got engaged

972
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,420
 and I remember having the most crippling anxiety

973
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,340
 where I was like, "Oh my gosh,

974
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,420
 "did I just make the biggest mistake of my life?"

975
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,900
 And at the time you're like engaged

976
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,100
 and I didn't have any of those emotions

977
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,040
 and then there was something about that engagement

978
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,940
 that I don't even know what happened.

979
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,180
 Maybe it's just what happens with cold feet

980
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,380
 or you just begin to like overplay

981
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,300
 and overplay and overplay and then you listen

982
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,460
 to people who give dumb advice like,

983
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,300
 "When you know, you know."

984
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,680
 And you're like, "Oh no, I thought I knew.

985
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,520
 "Now I don't know.

986
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,340
 "Maybe I don't know.

987
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,180
 "Oh no."

988
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,440
 And I had community come around and be like,

989
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,740
 "Hey, what are the reasons that you feel nervous

990
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,260
 "or you're worried about or you're concerned about?"

991
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,600
 And walk through 'em and I'd be like,

992
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,560
 "Man, I just, I don't know.

993
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,580
 "Maybe there could be somebody better out there for me."

994
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,120
 And they're like, "Yeah, there's eight billion people.

995
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,920
 "Chances are, possibly, that's not a good biblical reason

996
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,820
 "why this wouldn't be a marriage that would work."

997
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,500
 And I walked through and they were like,

998
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,100
 "Yeah, none of those are good reasons."

999
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,780
 And they began to just kind of put my feet back on earth

1000
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:42,780
 and go, "We think this is a good idea, a good relationship.

1001
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,200
 "And you're just getting cold feet and nerves.

1002
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,300
 "It's what happens."

1003
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
 And they were right.

1004
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,220
 Do you have people that can speak in like that

1005
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,440
 or they can say, "Hey, you guys,

1006
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,480
 "you guys are moving in together

1007
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,340
 "and you know God says that's not gonna lead

1008
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,160
 "to a place of a healthy relationship."

1009
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,580
 Do you have the right people?

1010
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,240
 Finally, check your plans.

1011
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,240
 You check your preferences, check your preparation,

1012
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,480
 check your pattern or priorities, and then check your plan.

1013
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,860
 Is marriage on the horizon?

1014
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,880
 In other words, how do I know if I'm ready to date?

1015
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,720
 Am I dateable?

1016
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,800
 The purpose of dating is to lead towards marriage.

1017
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,920
 And so is marriage on the horizon?

1018
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,760
 Here's what I mean by that.

1019
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,680
 To be abundantly clear for everybody in the room

1020
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,920
 who's like, "Yes, yes."

1021
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,320
 Or the people who are like, "Nuh-uh, uh-uh."

1022
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,840
 Could you see yourself getting married in the near future?

1023
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,440
 And by near future, in my opinion,

1024
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,800
 I would say a year to a year and a half, maybe two years.

1025
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,180
 You were not made to be in a perpetual relationship

1026
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,320
 with someone of the opposite sex that you're attracted to,

1027
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,920
 which hopefully would be the person you're dating

1028
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,200
 forever and ever and ever.

1029
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,440
 Jesus in Luke 12 said this about,

1030
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,680
 "Don't start something you can't finish."

1031
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,500
 In Luke 12, he said,

1032
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,680
 "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower.

1033
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,760
 "Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost

1034
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,160
 "to see if you have enough money to complete it?

1035
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,180
 "For if you lay the foundation,

1036
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,060
 "you're not able to finish it.

1037
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,700
 "Everyone who sees you will ridicule you,

1038
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,200
 "saying, 'This person began to build

1039
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,040
 "'and he wasn't able to finish.'

1040
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,280
 "Is marriage something that you can see in the near horizon,

1041
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,360
 "that you could actually say,

1042
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,640
 "'Man, I could see myself getting married.

1043
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,680
 "'I'm not saying you're going to.

1044
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,020
 "'I'm not saying you need to tell them that.

1045
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,240
 "'I'm just saying if marriage is off the table,

1046
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,840
 "'dating should be off the table.'"

1047
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,040
 And that may frustrate you, but if you can't stand the heat,

1048
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,800
 get out of the kitchen, because it is in the dating process

1049
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,780
 that we are walking on a path that every time

1050
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,160
 or every relationship should be one, this is for Christians,

1051
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,520
 where that dating is a path that leads to a promise.

1052
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,160
 That's at an altar, you're in a tux,

1053
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,600
 she's in a white dress, preacher man right there.

1054
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,480
 That leads to a lifelong pursuit.

1055
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,080
 Dating is a path to lead to a promise,

1056
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,260
 to lead to a lifelong pursuit, that's called marriage.

1057
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,240
 It is not to be this perpetual, and we're just dating.

1058
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,000
 I talk to some couples, and it's like,

1059
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,240
 "We've been dating five years."

1060
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,600
 Five years?

1061
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,360
 What information are you lacking?

1062
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,840
 I just want to see what he's like at Christmas.

1063
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,920
 You've had five of them.

1064
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,560
 How much more time do you need?

1065
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,160
 You were made, and if you date well, here's the deal.

1066
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,700
 Christian dating is not fun.

1067
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,160
 In other words, if it's fun, you're not doing it right,

1068
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,900
 because marriage is a way better relationship

1069
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,480
 where you and that person are yoked together

1070
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,600
 and love each other, and you're not playing the games,

1071
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,520
 you're not walking through having to leave at 10 o'clock

1072
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,600
 and asking for accountability.

1073
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,240
 You're like, "We're going home, you know what I'm saying?"

1074
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,680
 (congregation laughing)

1075
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,880
 And you're able to continually be around one another,

1076
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,980
 encourage, support.

1077
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,540
 And so if you're just perpetually dating,

1078
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,720
 you're either not dating like God says,

1079
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,100
 or there's something wrong there

1080
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,440
 that you should open and invite other people in.

1081
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,680
 Man, I don't know what it is,

1082
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,560
 but I'm just not ready to move forward.

1083
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,840
 And you should be honest enough with yourself

1084
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,160
 and with the person who you're dating to say,

1085
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,280
 "Hey, I'm not ready to move forward,

1086
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,400
 "and I don't think we should date."

1087
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,860
 And so is marriage on the horizon?

1088
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,220
 Is it something you're realistically like,

1089
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,700
 "Yes, I could see myself in the future,

1090
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,700
 "not five years, in the near future, getting married."

1091
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,220
 'Cause it's a path to a promise, a lifelong pursuit.

1092
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,420
 It's a little bit like this.

1093
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,780
 I hate going to the mall, hate it.

1094
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,380
 It's like, if you ever see me at the mall,

1095
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,700
 I'm probably in a bad mood because I'm at the mall.

1096
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,580
 And so when I go to the mall, which is very rare,

1097
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,700
 because I have mastered the art of online shopping.

1098
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,820
 I buy everything online, it's amazing.

1099
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,380
 It's incredible living in 2021.

1100
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,380
 And when I go to the mall, though, I don't know what it is.

1101
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,940
 It's just like, I walk in,

1102
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,780
 I don't know where anything is, the stores,

1103
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,580
 I can't breathe, the oxygen, there's so much perfume.

1104
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,820
 There's pretzels everywhere for some reason.

1105
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,900
 And it just is like, oh man, how do I get out of here?

1106
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,580
 And I go find that little map, and I find my store,

1107
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,620
 and I run to the map, or I run from the map to the store,

1108
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,820
 and I get there, and I begin to buy my thing,

1109
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,060
 and then I leave.

1110
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,820
 Then there's people, like my wife,

1111
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,300
 well, she will just go to the mall just for fun.

1112
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,260
 It's like, she just wants to walk around,

1113
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,420
 try things on, look at things.

1114
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,420
 Just, I don't even know what she's doing.

1115
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,580
 (laughing)

1116
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,260
 And this is apparently a very common thing,

1117
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,660
 'cause I'll, you know, people on my team,

1118
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,500
 or people that, like, it's just a relaxing thing.

1119
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,660
 I had the opposite experience.

1120
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,220
 It is what it is, neither's right, neither's wrong.

1121
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,380
 But the perspective of, hey, I'm here,

1122
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,660
 I know what I'm here to purchase,

1123
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,980
 I know what I'm here for, I'm going to do it,

1124
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,340
 not wasting time, not trying things on,

1125
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,300
 not gonna just stroll

1126
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,540
 if I don't have any money to purchase things.

1127
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,940
 That's okay when it comes to shopping.

1128
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,900
 It's not okay when it comes to dating.

1129
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,020
 That you weren't made to just go, you know what,

1130
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,340
 I'm gonna try this boy on, I'm gonna try this girl on,

1131
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,740
 I'm gonna try this relationship on,

1132
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,980
 I'm gonna try this relationship on.

1133
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,820
 I don't really have any interest in purchasing anything,

1134
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,820
 I just kind of want to see how it looks in this.

1135
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,820
 It's not something that, as Christians, you are to do,

1136
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,180
 because it's not loving,

1137
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,860
 'cause it's not putting the needs of the other person

1138
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,420
 in their heart, above your needs, and above your heart.

1139
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,300
 It's not guarding and protecting you

1140
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,340
 for your future marriage.

1141
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,660
 And it's okay to do that if you're shopping.

1142
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,380
 It's not okay to do that when it comes to dating.

1143
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:35,100
 Conclusion, as it relates to are you dateable,

1144
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,900
 I wanna walk through these really quick.

1145
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,900
 Have you addressed or checked your preparation?

1146
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,220
 How are you preparing for who you're gonna be?

1147
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,460
 Do you have the right priorities?

1148
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,520
 Like these are really my right, these are my priorities.

1149
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,740
 Because they're the ones God says I should prioritize.

1150
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:03,140
 Have you addressed your patterns?

1151
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,060
 Some of the brokenness that exists.

1152
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:10,500
 Do you have the right people, godly counselors in your life?

1153
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,700
 If not, maybe the thing you need to do to become dateable

1154
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,020
 is get into a community group,

1155
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,700
 go to First Step right after this.

1156
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,700
 Join a church somewhere.

1157
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,300
 This one or a local church where you have people

1158
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,500
 in your life to support.

1159
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,700
 And then do you have a plan?

1160
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,740
 Are you just strolling through, seeing what comes,

1161
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,900
 or do you know, no, this is what I'm looking for,

1162
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,100
 and I'm not going to the mall until I wanna purchase it.

1163
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,340
 I'm not going to date until I'm ready for it.

1164
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,620
 And if you do, and I know a lot of you do,

1165
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,780
 congratulations, you are dateable.

1166
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,120
 We'd like you to all stand up.

1167
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,920
 We're gonna do a mixer up in the loft

1168
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,740
 and try to get as many of you paired up as possible.

1169
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,720
 And I mean it, not the mix part.

1170
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,200
 I mean the dating part.

1171
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,120
 You should date.

1172
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,340
 There are godly men and godly women all over this place.

1173
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,180
 You should date.

1174
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:07,820
 And walk down that path towards the promise

1175
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,100
 of a lifelong pursuit,

1176
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,380
 whether or not it's with that person or not,

1177
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,660
 but you are dateable.

1178
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,580
 And I would highly encourage you.

1179
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,120
 Find a godly girl, or if it's a godly guy, say yes.

1180
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,120
 Others of you, you're not.

1181
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,300
 And I say that because I love you.

1182
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,780
 The best thing you can do is decide,

1183
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,740
 I'm gonna actually take these things to heart.

1184
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,280
 I'm gonna follow what God's word says.

1185
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,320
 I'm gonna prioritize my character.

1186
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,860
 I'm gonna prioritize working on me.

1187
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,700
 I'm gonna walk in community with other people.

1188
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,960
 I'm gonna deal with the dysfunction

1189
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,380
 that keeps tripping me up.

1190
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,160
 And I'm gonna give the best gift that I can give

1191
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,000
 to my spouse as I work on me.

1192
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,720
 That surgeon, like I said, she brought all that up.

1193
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,160
 She was like, man, if you don't,

1194
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,040
 you could literally die.

1195
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,320
 Which sounded so extreme when I was talking about food.

1196
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,940
 If I ate breakfast, she said, we will not do the surgery.

1197
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,400
 And we need you to be totally honest.

1198
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,180
 Did you eat anything?

1199
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,360
 Because we won't do the surgery.

1200
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,720
 Because if we did it, you could lose your life

1201
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,040
 because of essentially choking while you're on anesthesia.

1202
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:19,060
 In a similar way, following that checklist was crucial.

1203
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,940
 Following God's checklist as it relates to love,

1204
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,640
 romance, marriage, valuating is crucial.

1205
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,600
 Not from a physical pain and death,

1206
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,600
 but from a spiritual, emotional, relational death and pain.

1207
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,780
 And the decision is yours.

1208
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
 Are you gonna decide?

1209
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,220
 And I could not be more passionate

1210
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,900
 as I finish and wrap up here.

1211
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,100
 I wanna see God unleash godly men and women

1212
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,140
 who know eternity is real.

1213
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,980
 This life is not about love.

1214
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,620
 This life is not about this life.

1215
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,000
 This life is not about you.

1216
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,500
 This life is about Jesus.

1217
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,580
 And they come together with other godly men

1218
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
 or other godly women, and they get married,

1219
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,420
 and they have babies, and they have disciples

1220
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,780
 that they raise in their home

1221
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,200
 because they know heaven is real, eternity is real.

1222
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,120
 How I live in this life matters.

1223
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,020
 How you live in this life matters.

1224
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,420
 Who you date will determine who you marry,

1225
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,540
 which will determine the rest of your life,

1226
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,820
 or as long as that relationship is around.

1227
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,420
 And you have to decide.

1228
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,740
 Am I gonna do it my own way?

1229
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,580
 Am I gonna go, this guy doesn't know,

1230
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,380
 he doesn't even live in the real world.

1231
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,660
 Or are you gonna say, I'm actually gonna do what God says

1232
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,420
 when it comes to the single most important relationship

1233
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,780
 you'll ever have?

1234
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,700
 And if you think, ah, I'm gonna do it my way,

1235
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,140
 you are arrogant, you are a fool,

1236
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,040
 and no one should date you.

1237
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,900
 And then the godly ones in here are, I hope, I mean it,

1238
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,340
 I hope you get married,

1239
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,140
 and I hope you have an amazing marriage.

1240
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,860
 And you raise disciples in your home,

1241
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,700
 and you push back darkness that is all over the world.

1242
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,900
 And you represent what family is and marriage is,

1243
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,920
 which is a reflection of God.

1244
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,320
 It's all about God.

1245
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,460
 Like life is all about God.

1246
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,540
 And you get to decide today.

1247
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,780
 Am I gonna follow what God says, or am I not?

1248
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:10,140
 And I can't make that decision for you, but you can.

1249
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,320
 And it is one of the most important decisions

1250
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,100
 you will ever make.

1251
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,720
 So make it wisely.

1252
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,540
 Let me pray.

1253
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,940
 Father, I do pray with all sincerity

1254
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,420
 that there would be couples that form through this series,

1255
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,600
 in this room, and they walk deeply with you.

1256
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,820
 They represent a faith that models to a world around them.

1257
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,760
 Though none go with us, we will follow Jesus.

1258
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,920
 And we're gonna raise our children and point them to Jesus.

1259
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,880
 We're gonna live life, conduct our marriage,

1260
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,260
 and perfectly point them to Jesus,

1261
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,620
 that they understand that life is not about love

1262
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,620
 and all the different messed up messages that were sold

1263
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,180
 from the very time that we're little boys and girls,

1264
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,920
 fairy tales, that they put those ways of childhood

1265
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,580
 behind them and they walk with Jesus,

1266
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:19,520
 the one that they were made for, by,

1267
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,820
 and the relationship that matters more

1268
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,900
 than anything else in their life.

1269
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,620
 And I pray that you would end every relationship

1270
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,260
 right now in this room that is gonna lead to pain

1271
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,340
 and heartache, divorce, heartbreak,

1272
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,740
 and that you would protect them,

1273
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,140
 and that they would experience healing

1274
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,260
 and in the midst of any pain,

1275
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,380
 that you would be bigger than the pain.

1276
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,260
 And I just pray protection over all the dating relationships

1277
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,420
 that are here, that are honoring you,

1278
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,420
 that you would allow them to continue to.

1279
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,300
 We love you.

1280
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,420
 Thank you that you first loved us.

1281
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,500
 And in walking with you, we learn how to love.

1282
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,580
 Christ's name, amen.
