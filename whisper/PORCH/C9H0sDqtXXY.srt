1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,600
 All right, let's go, let's go, let's go.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200
 How we doing tonight, Porch?

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,320
 Hey, I wanna give a quick welcome to those

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,100
 tuning in live with us, some of our locations.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,760
 We have Philly, Phoenix, Fayetteville,

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
 and of course, hello to my friends here in the room

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
 at the Porch on this beautiful Tuesday night.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,880
 If we haven't met, my name is JD.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,240
 I'm on staff here at Watermark Community Church,

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,520
 and I get to serve every single Tuesday night

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,800
 here at the Porch, and I absolutely love it.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,720
 However, I'm usually in that chair producing the services,

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,560
 but this is my first time teaching the Word,

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,160
 and I could not be more excited.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,000
 Okay, let's go.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,120
 But here's the deal.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,000
 I thought, man, how am I gonna start this night?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,440
 And I don't know you guys, you don't know me,

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,480
 and so I thought I'd go ahead and just start from the bottom

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,960
 and maybe we'll get here.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,800
 So I think we all have that moment in life

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,280
 that we can all resonate with where we say,

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,560
 yeah, that probably wasn't my best moment.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,040
 And for me, it was the start of my college years.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,080
 Here I was, small town kid, big dreams, wide eyes,

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,160
 heading to the notorious Stephen F. Austin State University.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,600
 And really?

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
 Okay, ax 'em, baby.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,960
 And I go there and I'm a music major my whole life.

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,480
 I was a band nerd and yeah, band people.

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,200
 And oh my gosh, too early, wait, bring it down.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,160
 Not there yet.

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,400
 Okay, they're already messing with me.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,880
 I work on a production team, these are my friends.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,880
 But hey, so what happened was is I get to the university

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,080
 and I have these kind of like, okay, I think I'm the guy.

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,440
 And I quickly realized, dude, you're in the band.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,560
 You're not the guy.

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,640
 And one of those memories in band

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,920
 where we were sitting there, I'm in my uniform,

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,200
 picture me about 25 pounds heavier, curly hair.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,800
 And I'm at the front, I'm at the end of the field

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
 and this guy walks up, he's a sports photographer,

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
 one of those big lenses, you know what I'm talking about?

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,440
 And he gets over there and he's like,

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,160
 "Hey you, throw up the ax and smile."

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,000
 And I was like, I'm gonna give you way more

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
 than a smile, pal.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,400
 And I grabbed this cute girl and I'm like,

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
 "On the count of three, jump, throw the ax."

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,960
 And so I'm like, one, two, three, jump in the air,

53
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,280
 the picture you just saw.

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,880
 And okay, you can take it down.

55
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,320
 And I'm like, yeah, yeah, when I say.

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,520
 And so I'm sitting there and I jump up in the air

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,440
 and the guy takes the photo and leaves.

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,360
 And I'm like, but I guess I'll never see that again.

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,160
 Well, quickly I go through the year,

60
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,120
 kind of recognize, okay, I'm not much of a band guy.

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
 It just wasn't me.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,040
 I tried, I tried to force it, just wasn't happening.

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,200
 So I got rid of the major, changed my wardrobe,

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,440
 fixed my haircut, started working out a little bit.

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,400
 I know you're like, really?

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
 But I did, and I'm heading into sophomore year

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,680
 kind of feeling myself.

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,760
 And I'm like walking in, I'm like, okay, new year, new me,

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
 a new rendition of the JD.

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
 And I walk up and I remember it was a day like any other.

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,080
 And I get tagged in all these photos on Facebook.

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,920
 And the photo that you see now was that photo.

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
 It came back to haunt me.

74
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,600
 And here's how it was told.

75
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
 This cute girl comes up to me and she's like,

76
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,320
 hey, you know, and I'm a freshman.

77
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,680
 I'm like, yeah, she's like, and I'm like,

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,520
 I'm like, cool, like, you know, how you doing?

79
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,280
 And she says, you know, I think I know you.

80
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
 I was like, oh, you don't.

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
 But I mean, obviously there's a connection we cannot deny.

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,080
 And she says, no, no, I definitely know you.

83
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,800
 Wait, you're that band guy on that photo.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,240
 And what you don't realize is that photo

85
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,160
 is actually the acceptance letter to let people know

86
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,240
 that they were coming to SFA.

87
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,720
 And not only was it a photo of me jumping in the air,

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,480
 looking like a weirdo, what it also was,

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
 was when you opened it, it was like, congrats,

90
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,200
 and confetti popped out.

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,480
 And so I was literally sent all over the world.

92
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,240
 And no matter how much I try to change,

93
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,560
 no matter how much I worked out,

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
 no matter what I did, every single semester

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,120
 for the entirety of my college years,

96
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,360
 freshmen would come up to me like, you're the guy.

97
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,320
 And I'm like, I'm not that guy anymore.

98
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,520
 And deep down though, I mean, here I am 26,

99
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,800
 in this moment, I've had a few job experiences,

100
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,800
 and I still can't deny somewhere deep, deep down,

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,520
 I'm still that guy.

102
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,960
 I'm still living kind of like, man,

103
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,440
 I think in the back of my mind,

104
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
 that best moment is still kind of now,

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
 it's still somewhere in me.

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,680
 And that's kind of, I think, how we all feel at times,

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,920
 like, man, they're all coming in here with a time

108
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
 that, man, we could describe it as that moment

109
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,360
 wasn't my best moment.

110
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
 And when I was writing this,

111
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
 I couldn't help but think of a few celebrities

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,640
 that could probably say the same thing.

113
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,600
 Some I put down here, we have Miley Cyrus,

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,920
 from Hannah Montana to that.

115
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,080
 We have Britney Spears, from Blondie to Baldie.

116
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,440
 We have another low moment, I believe is, what is it?

117
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,280
 David Marvin, I mean, talk about, I mean, who is that guy?

118
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
 Talk about a low moment.

119
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,640
 Okay, God restores.

120
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,360
 And then what I also put here, I have Kanye West.

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
 You know, now you know him as Jesus King,

122
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,880
 but don't forget at one time, he'd had not his best moment,

123
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,680
 where he went and stole the award show

124
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,200
 and made fun of Taylor Swift and his drunken self.

125
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,280
 And then last but not least, I have Tiger Woods,

126
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
 who just won the massive, but at one time

127
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,760
 was known for his mugshot for getting a DUI.

128
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,600
 And I know that we're laughing,

129
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,200
 and I kind of come in with kind of this example,

130
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,560
 innocent, silly example, but reality is,

131
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
 we all, like I said, have a defining moment

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,960
 that we go, man, I don't wanna be reminded of that.

133
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,840
 That wasn't my best moment.

134
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,720
 That was definitely, I took an L.

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,180
 Like that was a season of intense failure.

136
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,320
 Some of you all walk into this place tonight

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,300
 and you're going, that's me now.

138
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,560
 I'm in that season.

139
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,660
 You're coming in here tonight and you're going, man,

140
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,240
 if only the people in this place knew how bad it is,

141
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
 they'd go running.

142
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,040
 They'd be like, get out of here.

143
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,920
 Some of you are coming here tonight,

144
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,520
 having made huge mistakes that you've never told anyone,

145
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,480
 that you're thinking right now, I swear to you,

146
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,920
 I am taking that to the grave.

147
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
 No one's ever gonna know,

148
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,520
 'cause that will redefine me for the rest of my life.

149
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,600
 If my parents knew, if my friends knew,

150
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,760
 if you knew, you wouldn't want anything to do with me.

151
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,800
 And it's heavy.

152
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,840
 And I don't want you to think,

153
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,900
 just 'cause I'm up here speaking on a stage

154
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,160
 and talking to you about the Bible,

155
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,680
 that I haven't been where you are

156
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,000
 and that I'm not where you are, 'cause that's all of us.

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,040
 If there's anything that we have in this room more common

158
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,600
 than the fact that we are loved by God,

159
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,700
 it's that we all make mistakes.

160
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,760
 We all fail.

161
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,560
 And so tonight, I wanna talk about,

162
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,440
 what do you do with that?

163
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,760
 What do you do when you can't seem to define your failures

164
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,200
 so they start to define you?

165
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,320
 What do you do in the midst of hardship and pain

166
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,280
 and mistake after mistake?

167
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 Because honestly, how you respond to failure in your life

168
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,200
 really defines your life.

169
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
 And if you don't know how to,

170
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,660
 your life is gonna be just full of anxiety,

171
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,580
 confusion, a weight, a pressure.

172
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,940
 And some of you might be experiencing that

173
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,440
 and you don't even realize it.

174
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,220
 So tonight, I wanna talk about some truths about failure.

175
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,760
 And if you're joining us for the first time,

176
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,900
 we're in a series called "Bloodline."

177
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,980
 We've been kind of highlighting key figures

178
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,820
 through the Old Testament that kind of made the bloodline

179
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,460
 that led to the example of Jesus.

180
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,580
 We hit Adam, a man that literally walked with God

181
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,900
 on the earth, lived in perfect harmony with God.

182
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,080
 There at the very beginning, God looked at him and said,

183
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,160
 "Man, you're my child.

184
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,640
 "We have this perfect thing going."

185
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,760
 And then boom, major failure, not his best moment,

186
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,520
 changed the trajectory for all of mankind.

187
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
 Abraham, a man known by faith, remarkable faith,

188
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,120
 but at the same time, didn't even believe

189
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,620
 that God would give him a son like he said he would.

190
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,000
 So he sleeps with his wife's servant.

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,840
 At one time, he does this weird thing

192
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,480
 where he disguises his wife as his sister

193
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
 to save his own back.

194
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
 He actually does it twice.

195
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,260
 And we see him also lack faith in moments,

196
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,960
 not his best moment.

197
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,960
 And tonight, we're gonna talk about my favorite character

198
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,200
 in the Bible, someone that I would say is probably,

199
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,000
 if not one of, if not the most famous character

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,280
 in the Old Testament, and his name is David.

201
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,460
 And David, a lot of you come in here and you go,

202
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,560
 "I think I've heard of David."

203
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,720
 Maybe like if you've heard of him,

204
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,040
 you've probably heard of David and Goliath.

205
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,640
 The David that conquered the giant,

206
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,380
 came up the little shepherd boy,

207
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,780
 was anointed to be King of Israel, the righteous King,

208
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,300
 the one they'd all been waiting for.

209
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,240
 He goes up to the nine foot Philistine,

210
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,900
 says, "In the name of the Lord, I'm gonna conquer you."

211
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,380
 Goes over, chops off his head

212
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,160
 after he does the slingshot thing.

213
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,540
 And all of this amazing moment,

214
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,020
 Israel, after his courage, follows pursuit,

215
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,540
 charges after the Philistines, conquers them.

216
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,180
 They follow his example.

217
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,740
 He's a ruling king, a righteous king.

218
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,580
 That's the David that we tend to know.

219
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,260
 But there's actually a part of David's life tonight

220
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,860
 that I wanna talk about that is a David

221
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,260
 that relates to a lot more of us.

222
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,460
 It's a David, it's a part of David's life

223
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,180
 that was defined by failure.

224
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,820
 And so tonight, I wanna talk about

225
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,460
 two things that are always true about failure.

226
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,940
 Two things that are always true about failure.

227
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,900
 And I wanna do that by looking specifically

228
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,740
 at the life of David.

229
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,700
 So if you have your Bibles,

230
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,540
 turn with me to 2 Samuel chapter 11.

231
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,900
 2 Samuel chapter 11.

232
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,340
 So like I said, David at this point is crushing it.

233
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,180
 Everything's going his way.

234
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,100
 And now Samuel, the plot thickens.

235
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,540
 He comes in on this moment

236
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,440
 that is a lot like a soap opera, you'll see.

237
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,180
 So in the spring of the year,

238
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,260
 the time when kings go out to battle,

239
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,340
 David sent Joab and his servants with him

240
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,020
 and all Israel, and they ravaged the Ammonites

241
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,020
 and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.

242
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,660
 So pause, real quick, I hope you see it.

243
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,620
 He's writing here, Samuel's saying,

244
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,420
 "A time when the kings," David,

245
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,620
 "are supposed to go out to battle,

246
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,340
 "but David remained in Jerusalem."

247
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,220
 It's kind of like when we are supposed to go to work

248
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,780
 and we call in sick, that's what David's doing.

249
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,800
 He's like, "I know I'm the king.

250
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,620
 "Don't feel like going to war today, you guys got it."

251
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,180
 Verse two, "It happened late one afternoon."

252
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,700
 I love that, I love that imagery.

253
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,340
 It's like, "It happened late one afternoon."

254
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
 There he was.

255
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,020
 "When David arose from his couch."

256
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,100
 And so if this was David in 2019,

257
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,940
 he's probably sitting there,

258
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,620
 he's probably hit a jewel a couple of times.

259
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,740
 Ladies, he's probably like on his fourth white claw,

260
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,480
 and he's sitting there, I don't know, drinking wine,

261
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 watching "The Bachelor," whatever it is.

262
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,020
 And then he goes walking on the roof,

263
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,420
 and he's walking on the roof of the king's house,

264
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,460
 and there he saw from the roof a woman bathing.

265
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,740
 It's getting steamy.

266
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,140
 And the woman was very beautiful.

267
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,100
 I love that emphasis.

268
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,060
 And the woman, she wasn't just pretty,

269
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,220
 she was very beautiful.

270
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,300
 She was smoking.

271
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,980
 This is the moment where David's walking around,

272
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,220
 he's chilling on the roof like,

273
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,340
 do, do, do, do, do, and he's like, "Aruga!"

274
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,940
 That's that moment for him, okay?

275
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,300
 I mean, he sees this woman bathing on the roof,

276
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,220
 and he's like, "Okay, who is this?

277
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,420
 "Let's keep on reading."

278
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,620
 Ooh, it's getting good.

279
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,660
 And David sent and inquired about the woman.

280
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,980
 Clearly the man had no game, had to send a wingman,

281
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,620
 and he says, "Hey."

282
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,000
 The wingman comes back and says,

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,060
 "I don't need to go down there.

284
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,340
 "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Elion,

285
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,020
 "the wife of Uriah, the Hittite?"

286
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,920
 Basically what he's saying is,

287
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,980
 "Yo, man, remember the bro code.

288
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,620
 "This is someone else's woman."

289
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,100
 And David said, don't care, he said,

290
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,700
 "So David sent messengers.

291
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,920
 "He took," what wasn't his,

292
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,480
 "He took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her.

293
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,800
 "Then she returned to her house, and the woman conceived,

294
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,260
 "and she sent and told David, 'I'm pregnant.'"

295
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,780
 Awkward.

296
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,780
 She comes to him, imagine, she's like, "Hey, David."

297
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,180
 He's like, "Oh, you back for round two?"

298
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,040
 And she's like, "Actually, no, I'm pregnant."

299
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,620
 So David immediately, can you imagine the heat

300
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,240
 he must have felt in that moment?

301
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,380
 Just sweating.

302
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,540
 So he's like, "I have to cover this up.

303
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,980
 "This is my, I don't fail, I'm the righteous king.

304
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,420
 "That's not who the Lord made me to be."

305
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,680
 So immediately he calls Uriah, her husband,

306
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,580
 off the battlegrounds and says,

307
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,500
 "Hey, I'm gonna get you really drunk,

308
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,260
 "have you go sleep with your wife,

309
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,680
 "so that way you wake up, she conceives,

310
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,540
 "and you think that's your baby."

311
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,260
 Perfect plan.

312
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,580
 But Uriah, being the man of character that he was,

313
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,100
 he comes, dines with the king,

314
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,580
 and when the king sends him to go have sex

315
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,680
 with his own wife, he says,

316
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,280
 "I can't go do that when my brothers are out at war.

317
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,680
 "You expect me to go sleep with my wife

318
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,900
 "while they're all out there fighting

319
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,080
 "on behalf of our nation?"

320
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,700
 It's like, that's crazy.

321
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,700
 So David will do anything to shut him up,

322
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,840
 to not expose himself, and so he tells the commander

323
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,320
 to put Uriah on the front lines back in the war,

324
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 and we all know what happens on the front lines,

325
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,300
 he was killed.

326
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,260
 I mean, can you imagine this moment?

327
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,840
 The man just committed murder,

328
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,700
 and it all began because he was at home

329
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,020
 when he should have been at war.

330
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,660
 Which leads me to my first point.

331
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,020
 The first thing that's always true about our failure

332
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,860
 is we fail when we don't go to war.

333
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,780
 We fail when we don't go to war.

334
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,260
 Here's the reality, just like David physically

335
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,180
 was not where he was supposed to be in the action,

336
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,280
 in the war zone, being the king that he was called to be,

337
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,020
 so you and I have to wake up every day,

338
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,460
 and we have to walk in what we're called to be.

339
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,180
 We have to understand that we are stepping into a war,

340
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,080
 and the moment that you get up and you don't realize

341
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,660
 that you are in a war, you're going to fail.

342
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,700
 It happens every single time.

343
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,820
 So the first thing I want you to recognize

344
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,740
 is that you are in a war.

345
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,940
 And you have to ask yourself,

346
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,300
 what, come on, David, why all of this?

347
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,120
 And clearly he's having an internal struggle,

348
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,820
 a war going on inside of him first and foremost,

349
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,400
 and that war is called the need to feed

350
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,760
 what we call a sinful nature.

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,500
 A sinful nature, you and I both have it.

352
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,460
 It's the thing that wars inside of you.

353
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,480
 You didn't have to get this thing,

354
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,860
 you didn't have to create this thing,

355
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,640
 it was just born in you ever since the garden.

356
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,300
 Here's a really simple way to talk about a sinful nature.

357
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,760
 When you leave here today, you're gonna be like,

358
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,220
 that was so awesome, go God,

359
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,020
 and you're gonna get in your car,

360
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,060
 and you're gonna get in the parking lot,

361
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,260
 and you're gonna wait in a line,

362
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,020
 and at first you're like, kind of all joy, okay?

363
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,020
 And you're gonna play your worship music,

364
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,080
 and suddenly you're gonna be like,

365
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,060
 all right, it's been 15 minutes, I'm hungry,

366
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,780
 and you're gonna immediately start getting angry,

367
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,600
 and the parking guy is just like, yeah,

368
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,660
 and you're like, man, go away!

369
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,940
 That anger right there,

370
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,260
 no one did anything to make you have that,

371
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,300
 you literally just have a sinful nature.

372
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,860
 You have it, I have it, David had it.

373
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,880
 And so, the reason why that is,

374
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,360
 is because there are three things in your whole life

375
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,940
 that you're gonna be searching to feed.

376
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,760
 You're gonna be wanting to feed the desire

377
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,900
 to have security, significance, and satisfaction.

378
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,240
 I remind myself of that often.

379
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,360
 JD, remember, every day you are searching for security,

380
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
 significance, and satisfaction,

381
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,740
 and what are you gonna find it in?

382
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,180
 What are you gonna choose today to find those things in?

383
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,260
 For some of us, we're looking for security

384
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,340
 in our finances and how much money we can make,

385
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,700
 the job position that we have so we keep climbing

386
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,580
 because, man, that's gonna provide for me,

387
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,660
 that's gonna provide for my family,

388
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,700
 we're gonna have the house and the kodosack.

389
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,900
 Some of you are gonna look for significance

390
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,380
 in that dating relationship.

391
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,620
 Man, think about all the comments, the goals,

392
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,700
 relationship goals that we're gonna get

393
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,020
 when we post that picture,

394
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,840
 and then one day it's gonna lead to marriage,

395
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,740
 and I'm gonna have a constant just source of significance.

396
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,140
 And some of you are looking to feed satisfaction

397
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
 through quick fixes,

398
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,060
 anything to make you feel something in the moment,

399
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,860
 whether it's going out, getting high,

400
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,500
 having a one-night stand for the adrenaline rush,

401
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,260
 looking at porn, whatever it is,

402
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,280
 we're all searching for it.

403
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,220
 I know for me right now in this season,

404
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,580
 I feed those things in the form of anxiety.

405
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,420
 I feed anxiety.

406
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
 And here's why.

407
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,020
 I want God to be proud of me.

408
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,320
 There's some void in me often

409
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,840
 when I am not getting up and going to war

410
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,960
 that I think God isn't proud of me,

411
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,980
 so I need to do more.

412
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,820
 I need to climb a ladder and achieve more

413
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,160
 so God will be proud of me.

414
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,440
 And when I don't feel like God is proud of me,

415
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,400
 when I'm not going to war,

416
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,320
 here's what I do.

417
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
 I turn to others,

418
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,440
 and I do things to get their attention, to get a laugh.

419
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,480
 I look for affirmation from flirting with girls.

420
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,640
 I go and I work out.

421
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,100
 I push myself pretty hard.

422
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,440
 I know you probably can't tell,

423
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,360
 but I do try.

424
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,220
 And it's also I can feel good about my body

425
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,520
 and the way I can walk into a room

426
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,480
 and not have to constantly compare myself to everyone else.

427
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,920
 I go to leaders and I do things in front of them

428
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,200
 so I get an attaboy.

429
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,520
 And it's so short-lived.

430
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,200
 And I've just realized,

431
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,520
 no matter what it's been in my life,

432
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,640
 every time I go to war to feed myself,

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,960
 it's never enough.

434
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
 And for you,

435
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,920
 you might be looking to feed yourself

436
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,500
 in that sinful nature through porn, sex,

437
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
 the things that I've said, one night stands,

438
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,300
 that dating app, that marriage, I don't know,

439
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,100
 but it's never going to be enough.

440
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,640
 And you need to ask yourself,

441
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,380
 when am I prone to fall to this?

442
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,060
 When is my rooftop moment?

443
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,560
 When am I like David strolling around

444
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,700
 looking to feed this hunger?

445
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,120
 When am I on the couch, bored, watching sports, home alone,

446
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,500
 looking over my computer, knowing where it will lead me

447
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,860
 and sitting there and contemplating?

448
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,020
 Like, when am I doing that?

449
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,340
 And ask yourself,

450
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,180
 what is the rooftop moment?

451
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,980
 What is the couch moment in your life

452
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,700
 that you are sitting there apathetic

453
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,620
 and you're not getting up and you're not fighting

454
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,680
 and going to war against your sinful nature?

455
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,220
 A lot of times, the reason why we do that,

456
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,500
 we think we have to feed ourselves

457
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,060
 because we don't think that God has enough to feed us.

458
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:39,000
 We don't think that God wants to give us all we need.

459
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
 We think oftentimes that God

460
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,460
 is withholding something from us.

461
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,740
 Like, he's just like, "Mm-mm, not today."

462
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,840
 And that's just not who he is.

463
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
 But I'll tell you this,

464
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,380
 there's also someone else going to war every day,

465
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,480
 and it's the devil.

466
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,080
 And he's going to war, whether you realize it or not,

467
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,640
 whether you're ready or not, here he comes.

468
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,320
 And when he's watching you and he's going,

469
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,880
 look at him feeding their sinful nature,

470
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
 they must think that God's withholding from them.

471
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,520
 They must think that God's not enough.

472
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,720
 Man, I bet right now they have open hands

473
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,560
 looking for anything to feed that desire.

474
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,920
 He will always put something in your hands

475
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,600
 because that's what he does.

476
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,960
 The devil is going to war, whether you're ready or not.

477
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,560
 First Peter 5, 8 through 9 says,

478
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,300
 "Be sober-minded, be watchful.

479
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,780
 "Your adversary, the devil, he prowls around

480
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,560
 "like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

481
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,200
 "Resist him firm in your faith,

482
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,800
 "knowing that the same kinds of suffering

483
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,660
 "are being experienced by your brotherhood

484
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,560
 "throughout the world."

485
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,280
 John 10, 10 says, "The thief, the devil,

486
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,940
 "he comes only to steal and kill and destroy,

487
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,660
 "but I came that you may have life and have it abundantly."

488
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,760
 That is God saying, "Hello, I have enough for you.

489
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,100
 "I'm not withholding for you.

490
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
 "And what sometimes you think you want,

491
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,040
 "if I gave that to you,

492
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,960
 "it would actually lead to you killing a guy, David.

493
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,500
 "So why don't you trust that I'm gonna give you

494
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,020
 "what you need in the time that you need it."

495
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,660
 And in that waiting though, the devil is watching

496
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,100
 and he's prowling and he's creeping.

497
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,500
 And he's in a war and he's looking for those

498
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,660
 who aren't fighting, who are vulnerable,

499
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,200
 like a lion sitting there watching.

500
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,300
 He's looking for the weak gazelle, the baby.

501
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,300
 And that's the one he attacks.

502
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,540
 He's looking for people who aren't getting up

503
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,400
 and going into the war.

504
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,620
 And so you need to get up and you need to wake up.

505
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,180
 He's looking to take from you.

506
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,820
 He'll make it seem like he wants to give you something,

507
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,340
 something that will satisfy,

508
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,940
 but I promise slowly but surely it's only taking.

509
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,020
 And here's how he does it.

510
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,340
 The enemy will minimize your sin before you commit it,

511
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,360
 and he will maximize it after you've done it.

512
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,020
 The enemy, hear me, the enemy will minimize your sin

513
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,780
 before you commit it and maximize it after you've done it.

514
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,180
 That's why you're afraid to tell people.

515
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,500
 That's why you're walking around in a facade,

516
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,840
 faking it all the time,

517
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,820
 because you know you listened to him again.

518
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,860
 You believe the whisper.

519
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,900
 He's sitting there and he's like,

520
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,440
 "Man, if you just, you know, I know that,"

521
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,660
 or you know that every time you text that ex

522
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,640
 who only wanted something from you,

523
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,060
 that that only leads to him

524
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,700
 taking something from you physically,

525
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,580
 but the enemy's gonna sit there and go, "Come on.

526
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,540
 It's just, he just texted you.

527
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,660
 Just text him back.

528
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,780
 He just wants to hang out.

529
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,100
 Maybe this time he'll actually listen.

530
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,180
 Maybe this time he'll actually want a real relationship

531
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,620
 and not just sex."

532
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,580
 And then every time you find yourself,

533
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,220
 you give in and on that drive home, he's screaming at you.

534
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,060
 Look at what you did.

535
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,860
 You worthless, pathetic.

536
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,940
 Here you go again.

537
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,660
 You're not worthy of a good love life.

538
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,380
 You're not worthy of a happy marriage

539
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,300
 because you just keep going back to this.

540
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,500
 And that's why you're afraid,

541
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,140
 because you're listening to that roar of the lion

542
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,420
 that is our enemy.

543
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,660
 And it is time that our generation,

544
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,620
 it is time that we as young adults

545
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,880
 stop letting the Satan have a voice in our life

546
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,620
 and in our culture and in our society.

547
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,300
 And it's time that we stop giving him opportunities

548
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,860
 to come and feed us nothing but lies.

549
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,020
 But he's going to every time.

550
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,180
 So you have to get up and you have to go to war.

551
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,260
 And here's how you do that.

552
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,780
 First, we do that with taking hold of our weapons

553
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,340
 and God's given us weapons 'cause he's a good God

554
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,620
 who wants good things for us, life and life to the full.

555
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,260
 The first weapon he gives us is God's word.

556
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,300
 I have wanted to say this for a long time to people my age.

557
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:57,140
 It is time that we bring the Bible back.

558
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,660
 It is time that we start turning back to the word of God.

559
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,180
 Because what I see right now is a generation

560
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,220
 that does not know truth.

561
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,420
 And they are falling every day to lies

562
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,240
 because they don't know truth.

563
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,540
 Right now, some of you, you are believing a lie

564
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,640
 simply because you don't know truth.

565
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,760
 You're walking in darkness

566
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,860
 and you think you're walking in the light.

567
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,080
 But you're being deceived.

568
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,460
 And so I want you to know that this right here

569
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,420
 is not just some rule book.

570
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,460
 This isn't something God gave for people

571
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,900
 who wanna become Christians to just follow some law

572
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,700
 and be like, "Bad, how dare you?"

573
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,740
 That's not what this is.

574
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,780
 I'll tell you, I just recently

575
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,740
 started taking the word of God seriously in my life.

576
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,980
 And it's changed everything.

577
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,360
 This is how you have life and have it abundantly.

578
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,880
 I always say, you don't know a line is crooked

579
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,200
 until you see a straight line.

580
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,260
 Until you see a straight line,

581
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,040
 you don't know the line's crooked.

582
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,960
 It's the same.

583
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,040
 Until you see the truth, I mean, really see it

584
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,520
 the way God intended for you to,

585
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,560
 until you become a steward of the word,

586
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,700
 you get around people, some of you are going,

587
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,520
 "Man, I wouldn't even know where to start."

588
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,560
 Just start.

589
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,880
 Open up the book of John.

590
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,360
 Just read the life of Jesus.

591
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,520
 Get around people in this building right here.

592
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,600
 Come up to the front, find someone in a port shirt

593
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,480
 and just say, "I don't know how to read my Bible."

594
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,720
 I promise they will put you on the right direction,

595
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,260
 but just start.

596
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,720
 This is a weapon.

597
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,280
 Ephesians 6 says, "Put on the whole armor of God

598
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
 "that you may be able to stand

599
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,400
 "against the schemes of the devil."

600
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,760
 He goes on to say more specifically in verse 17,

601
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,440
 "And take the helmet of salvation

602
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,400
 "and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."

603
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,080
 If you're gonna go to battle, you better have a weapon.

604
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,380
 You better have your sword.

605
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,180
 And that sword is the word of God.

606
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,200
 It is enough and it will go before you

607
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,900
 and fight for you on your behalf

608
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,720
 because this right here is God.

609
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,480
 And so start using it.

610
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,200
 Start knowing it.

611
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,300
 Start reading it.

612
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,200
 The second thing that we can use as a weapon in the battle

613
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
 is God's people.

614
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,320
 I love this part of the story.

615
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,480
 We see that David just murdered Uriah,

616
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,140
 had him killed and all these different things.

617
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,640
 And then God sends a prophet by the name of Nathan

618
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,920
 to come and basically wake up David

619
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,040
 and say, "Hey, you've gotten out of the war."

620
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,480
 And here's what he says in 2 Samuel 12, verse one.

621
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,000
 "And the Lord sent Nathan to David.

622
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,560
 "He came to him and said to him,

623
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,840
 "there were two men in a certain city."

624
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,200
 Man, he totally finesses David right here.

625
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,040
 Here we go.

626
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,080
 "There were two men in a certain city,

627
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,340
 "the one rich and the other poor.

628
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,900
 "The rich man had very many flocks and herds,

629
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,760
 "but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb,

630
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,240
 "which he had bought.

631
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,480
 "And he brought it up and he grew up with him

632
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,180
 "and with his children.

633
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,580
 "He used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup

634
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,680
 "and lie in his arms.

635
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,340
 "And it was like a daughter to him.

636
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,640
 "Now there came a traveler to the rich man.

637
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,440
 "And he was unwilling to take one of his own flock

638
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,360
 "or herd to prepare for the guests who had come to him.

639
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,560
 "But he took the poor man's one lamb

640
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,200
 "and prepared it for the man who had come to him.

641
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,840
 "And then David, boiling with anger,

642
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,300
 "was greatly kindled against the man.

643
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,800
 "And he said to Nathan, 'As the Lord lives,

644
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,300
 "'the man who has done this deserves to die.

645
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,160
 "'And he shall restore the lamb fourfold

646
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,420
 "'because he had done this thing

647
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,900
 "'and because he had no pity.'

648
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,800
 "And Nathan looked at David like a good brother in Christ.

649
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,500
 "And he said, 'You are the man.'"

650
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,040
 When's the last time that you had someone in your life

651
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,000
 look at you and say, "Hey, wake up.

652
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,780
 "You are the man."

653
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,040
 And not in a good way.

654
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,700
 When's the last time you had someone actually tell you

655
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,140
 what you needed to hear?

656
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,440
 I bet this wasn't comfortable.

657
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
 Imagine Nathan in this moment going up to the king

658
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,400
 that just killed a guy to go tell him

659
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,680
 that he's got food in his teeth, essentially.

660
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,520
 Like, "Hey, you're doing something wrong.

661
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,420
 "This isn't who you're called to be."

662
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,460
 But he does it.

663
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,480
 And in that moment, David could have taken the easy way out.

664
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,160
 He could have hushed him, pushed him away.

665
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,780
 Sometimes when people come and tell us truth,

666
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,620
 we're so quick to be like,

667
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,480
 "Man, you don't know what's good for me.

668
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,760
 "I can love whoever I want.

669
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,580
 "Love is love.

670
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,460
 "You just want me to be happy.

671
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,000
 "You don't really know what's good for me."

672
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
 And we're so quick to push away people

673
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,080
 who just want what's best for us.

674
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,800
 Not what's good for us, what's best for us.

675
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,640
 Why?

676
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,960
 It's because we don't realize that we're in the war.

677
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,680
 And I love what David does here.

678
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,260
 He doesn't let this just stew in him with anger,

679
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,080
 but he does actually,

680
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,200
 as he lets it change the trajectory of his life.

681
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,640
 Which leads to my second thing

682
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,380
 that's always true about your failure.

683
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,380
 When we fail, we can always run to God, not from him.

684
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,620
 When we fail, we can always run to God, not from him.

685
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
 Here's where we see this take place.

686
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,940
 David's sitting there, Nathan just came to him,

687
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,780
 and Nathan says all this to him, calls him out,

688
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,620
 and David goes, and there's this book called Psalms

689
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,140
 that we see, it's the biggest book of the Bible.

690
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,040
 And David goes, and he kind of writes in his diary

691
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,300
 the thoughts of this moment and his brokenness.

692
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,920
 And he comes before God, and he has this exchange with God,

693
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,460
 and here's what he says.

694
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,260
 Right after all of this goes down,

695
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,220
 have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love,

696
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,820
 according to your abundant mercy,

697
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,500
 blot out my transgressions.

698
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,200
 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity

699
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,580
 and cleanse me from my sin, for I know my transgressions.

700
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,420
 I know what I did, God, and my sin is ever before me.

701
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,700
 Verse 10, created me a clean heart, O God,

702
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,820
 and renew of my spirit within me.

703
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,580
 Come and change me from the inside out.

704
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,140
 Verse 16, for you will not delight in sacrifice,

705
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,980
 or I will give it.

706
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,800
 You don't want my works.

707
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,640
 You don't want my church attendance.

708
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,140
 You don't want my money.

709
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,700
 You will not be pleased with a burnt offering.

710
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,260
 The sacrifices of God, what he wants are a broken spirit,

711
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,140
 a broken and contrite heart, a God you will not,

712
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,660
 O God, you will not despise.

713
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,640
 How you respond to God in your sin

714
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,700
 reveals what you think about your God.

715
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,860
 How you respond to sin, if you run from God in your sin,

716
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,860
 that tells me that you think something wrongly of God.

717
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,460
 Because my God, our God, the God of the Bible

718
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,040
 is a God that you can run right to in your failure.

719
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,580
 You don't have to run from him.

720
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,800
 And I bet David in this moment,

721
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,300
 I mean, I bet he's feeling it.

722
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,100
 It's probably hard, but he pushes through

723
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,300
 and he runs to God and it changes him from the inside out.

724
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,320
 And why can we do that?

725
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
 Why can we run to God?

726
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,360
 It's because he loves us.

727
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,660
 God loves you.

728
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,300
 If you take away anything from this talk, let it be this,

729
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,100
 God loves you.

730
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,980
 That's crazy.

731
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,820
 David, you just slept with another man's woman

732
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,580
 and then you killed him.

733
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,340
 And guess what?

734
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,020
 Here you are broken, a sinner, nothing.

735
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,500
 And all he does is say, David, I love you.

736
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,420
 Not because of anything that you are,

737
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,800
 not because of anything you are,

738
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,220
 because of all that I am.

739
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,020
 And all that I am is a God that loves his children

740
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,180
 no matter what.

741
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,260
 And the reason why you can run to God,

742
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,060
 the reason why you can talk about your sin

743
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,900
 and your mistakes is because he loves you.

744
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,860
 Romans 8, one says, "There is now no condemnation

745
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,420
 "for those who are in Christ Jesus,

746
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,820
 "for those who do not walk in the flesh, but in the spirit."

747
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,300
 How, JD?

748
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,820
 How is there no condemnation?

749
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,660
 I deserve this.

750
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,180
 If only you knew what I did.

751
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,380
 And I would tell you this, and I'll wrap up.

752
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,680
 There was a time in my life, hardest season of my life.

753
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,380
 I lost my dad in his forties to cancer.

754
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,340
 Life sucked.

755
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,780
 It was really bad, I was in college.

756
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,700
 And I ran from God,

757
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,860
 and I just pretty much gave the bird to God.

758
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,500
 I knew who he was, but I just chased partying and alcohol

759
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,540
 and anything that could make me feel something

760
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,020
 to feel satisfied, and I could take control of my life.

761
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,540
 And I did it for six months.

762
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,460
 And I'll never forget the night, like David,

763
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,740
 I was just laying there, New Year's Eve, all alone.

764
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,900
 I had pushed everything and everyone that I loved

765
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,940
 out of my life.

766
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,420
 And I just laid there in the dark,

767
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,100
 drunk in an empty house.

768
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,580
 If you're alone on New Year's Eve, it's pretty bad.

769
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,080
 And I'm going, I don't wanna bring in a new year.

770
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,140
 And I just cried out to God.

771
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,160
 And I said, God, why?

772
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,420
 Why is it like this?

773
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,220
 Why is this so hard?

774
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,220
 Why do I keep making these mistakes?

775
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,140
 I get it, you're probably gone.

776
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:49,140
 And he just stopped me and he said, JD, I love you.

777
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,180
 And I just wept.

778
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,860
 I laid there drunk in the dark and I wept.

779
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,020
 And what was true of that moment in my life,

780
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,820
 and what was true of David's moment, and this moment,

781
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,540
 and what's true of your moments, your mistakes,

782
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,100
 and your failures that you're walking in here with tonight,

783
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,260
 is that there is a God that you can run to.

784
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,180
 And say, God, blot out my transgressions,

785
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,420
 make me whiter than snow.

786
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,780
 All I have to bring you is nothing.

787
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,220
 And he says, that's everything.

788
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,800
 That's all I need is nothing, because I am everything.

789
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,620
 And I bet if you don't know,

790
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,180
 next week we're talking about Jesus and the bloodline,

791
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,620
 and God makes a promise.

792
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,820
 God makes a promise to David

793
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,040
 right before he messes up with Bathsheba.

794
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,380
 God comes down to David and says,

795
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,700
 hey, David, I'm gonna use you

796
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,120
 to bring the line of Jesus to the world.

797
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,500
 The savior of the world, David,

798
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,160
 is gonna come through your blood.

799
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,340
 And I bet David in that moment is going, but,

800
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,260
 but God, me?

801
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,820
 He's here writing Psalm 51.

802
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,020
 He's like, man, God, please blot out what I did with Bathsheba

803
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,140
 and how I murdered Uriah,

804
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,180
 because I still wanna be used by you.

805
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,940
 I still wanna have promises with you.

806
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,220
 I still want you to trust me.

807
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,720
 I still want you to love me.

808
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,660
 And I bet as he's writing out Psalm 51,

809
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,840
 he's wondering, is God still gonna do it?

810
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,380
 Is God still gonna use my blood, my line,

811
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,220
 my offsprings to bring Jesus to the world?

812
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,700
 Would he do something that crazy

813
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,100
 through someone so broken?

814
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,080
 And the best part of this whole thing,

815
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,940
 the first sentence of the New Testament,

816
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,380
 the greatest story ever told,

817
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,540
 the beginning scene of the story of Jesus,

818
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,060
 the God-man on earth, opens up with this.

819
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:49,140
 Matthew 1:1, the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,

820
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,940
 the son of David.

821
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,540
 Do you know what that means?

822
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,260
 The son of David, God was faithful.

823
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:07,340
 God actually took a future child of David and Bathsheba,

824
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,100
 a woman that he had an affair with

825
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,620
 and produced an offspring that failed,

826
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,780
 an offspring that failed,

827
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,420
 and an offspring that failed time and time again.

828
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,900
 And he still brought Jesus, he still used David.

829
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,740
 And why?

830
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,460
 Because Jesus had to come

831
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,100
 because he would be different.

832
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,380
 He would redirect the story and he would make a way.

833
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,220
 He would come and die a sinner's death.

834
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,060
 David's sin, your sin, my sin,

835
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,120
 he would pay for it on the cross.

836
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,980
 All of wrath from all of mankind would be thrown on him

837
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,340
 and he would die and he would bury sin and shame

838
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,180
 once and for all.

839
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,100
 On the third day, he would rise again

840
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,700
 and change our lives forever and make a way.

841
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,460
 God's saying, "Yeah, on your own, you can't come to me

842
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,740
 'cause you do have nothing.

843
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,580
 But through my son, because of my faithfulness,

844
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,420
 you can run to me now.

845
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,340
 Because all I see when I look at you

846
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,820
 is the blood of my son."

847
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,540
 And that is the best news.

848
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,140
 And if you haven't been honest with yourself,

849
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,260
 if you haven't gone to war,

850
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,700
 if you haven't told someone

851
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,860
 about the things that you've been carrying

852
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,700
 because you haven't seen yourself worthy of being redeemed,

853
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,500
 tonight is the night.

854
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,600
 Don't walk out of here without a weapon.

855
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,500
 Don't go back into the war zone on your own.

856
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,380
 Deal with it tonight.

857
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,460
 Because that's what he died for

858
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,740
 so you could run to God, not from him.

859
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,860
 Father, I ask that if there is anyone here

860
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,340
 who is walking in going,

861
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,660
 "JD, you don't know my story, man.

862
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,420
 It's bad.

863
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,120
 The drugs were bad.

864
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,620
 The addiction is bad.

865
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,220
 The abortion, I can't get it out of my mind."

866
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,640
 That right now, they would hear the truth

867
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,660
 that they are known and loved by a God

868
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,260
 who sent his son for that very reason,

869
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,240
 that even when they're not faithful,

870
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,540
 they could run to the faithfulness of our Father

871
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,660
 who fulfilled his promise and brought his son to the earth.

872
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,820
 Maybe wake up every day

873
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,820
 recognizing that we are in a war,

874
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,100
 we are being attacked.

875
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,820
 But through you, through others, and through the word,

876
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,420
 we have the power to say no to the enemy

877
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,380
 and yes to the everlasting good

878
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,180
 and gracious love of our Father.

879
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,020
 Amen.
