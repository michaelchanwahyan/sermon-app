1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,960
 How's it going?

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,640
 How are you guys doing?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,720
 Doing good?

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,560
 Awesome.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,120
 If you have your Bibles, Genesis 1.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,000
 If you don't know where that is,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,200
 just open to the first page.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,160
 And there you have it.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
 We'll be in Genesis 1, maybe Genesis 2.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
 We'll see how this goes.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,080
 I just kind of start the clock and get running

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
 and we just end when we end.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,880
 That's how I tend to do it.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,280
 We'll see how fun that is.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,400
 I'm excited to be with you guys.

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,480
 Man, it has been a long time since I've been with you guys.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,900
 I don't know if anyone's been coming to the porch

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,720
 for a long time, but I spoke a handful of times

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,480
 like four or five years ago, did launch retreat back then,

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,320
 and then took a big break from the porch family,

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,160
 but it's good to be back.

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,980
 I miss you guys.

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,820
 You guys are awesome.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,200
 I miss you guys back.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,840
 So again, the series, Datable.

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
 I'm just gonna jump into it

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,880
 because I am so excited for tonight.

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,640
 I'm excited for us to lean in to the scriptures.

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,760
 Now, there's kind of this axiom

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,720
 that I think is, we would all resonate with,

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,820
 and it's essentially this.

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,520
 It's essentially that so many of us,

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,660
 and I know this resonates with me

35
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,160
 and specifically in my mid-20s,

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,440
 that life can be going poorly.

37
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,420
 Everything around you can be kind of breaking apart

38
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,160
 or falling apart, but if you have a relationship

39
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,520
 that's relatively healthy

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,600
 or you're doing it the right way,

41
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,640
 it's crazy how everything can feel fine.

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,160
 And the flip is true as well, right?

43
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,420
 Where everything in your life can be going well.

44
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,320
 Jobs, promotion, maybe a promotion with money,

45
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,200
 certain things, certain whatever,

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
 but if there's something in a relationship

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
 that is breaking you, that's difficult,

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,040
 or you're making unwise choices

49
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,320
 that's kind of destroying your soul and your heart,

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
 then it's crazy how it feels like everything is breaking.

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,680
 What I'm saying with that is there's something

52
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,360
 about God's design for human relationships

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
 that is central to who we are.

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,880
 And I mean that, by the way, single, dating, or not, right?

55
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,800
 I mean in the sense of just how we feel about them,

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,120
 how we think about them, how we enter into them.

57
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,960
 There's something about human relationships

58
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,640
 that is very close to how God wired us,

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
 how God designed us, and who we are.

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
 So that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.

61
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,840
 We're gonna talk about what is God's design

62
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,460
 for human flourishing, for human relationships,

63
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,020
 for sexuality, and all these different types of things.

64
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,600
 We're gonna go all the way back to the beginning

65
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,940
 and look at what I like to say is the blueprint, okay?

66
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,840
 Now when I say the word blueprint, what do you think of?

67
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,520
 I don't know about you, I actually think of Jay-Z's albums.

68
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,400
 Anyone else?

69
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,720
 Okay, besides that, what you probably think of

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,160
 is architectural drawings or something of that nature.

71
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,920
 A blueprint tends to be a framework, a map,

72
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
 a thing that you look at in regards to showing you

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
 the design of something before what?

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
 Before you go on and build something, right?

75
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240
 Before you go on and do something.

76
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,720
 And so it is with God's design for us with relationships,

77
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,360
 where he has a blueprint.

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,400
 If you try to go forward without it,

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
 have fun building a house without a blueprint,

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,440
 see how that goes.

81
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,720
 It doesn't end well.

82
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,600
 It doesn't end well, but if we listen to the wisdom of God,

83
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,520
 how he's created and wired us to work,

84
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
 then that's what leads us to flourishing.

85
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,900
 So we're gonna go back and look at that.

86
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,720
 So again, if you have your Bibles,

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,100
 let's go to Genesis chapter one.

88
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,240
 And I'm not gonna cover all of the points,

89
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,640
 but I think there's, what I wanna do is cover,

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
 I think, some of the more often missed ones.

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,840
 And so we'll just start reading and go from there.

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,860
 Genesis chapter one, let's go down to verse 26 for me.

93
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,960
 I might have a tough time reading it too,

94
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200
 'cause my two-year-old just ripped this yesterday, so.

95
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,040
 (congregation laughing)

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,840
 Yeah, I mean, the kid's just ripping the scriptures.

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,080
 Like, what kind of hatred for God is that?

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
 Okay.

99
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,960
 (congregation laughing)

100
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,640
 Verse 26, "Then God said,

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,400
 "let us make man in our image after our likeness,

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,880
 "and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,

103
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,760
 "and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock,

104
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
 "and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing

105
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,060
 "that creeps on the earth."

106
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,840
 Verse 27, "So God created man," what?

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,820
 "In his own image.

108
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,400
 "In the image of God, he created him,

109
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,040
 "male and female, he created them.

110
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,400
 "And God blesses them.

111
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,480
 "And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply,

112
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,920
 "and fill the earth and subdue it,

113
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,800
 "and have dominion over the fish of the sea,

114
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
 "and over the birds of the heaven,

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,260
 "and over every living thing that moves on the earth."

116
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,840
 So we're just gonna sit there for a second,

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,920
 'cause there's a lot in there.

118
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,000
 But the first one I wanna zoom in on is what we saw there.

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
 What was the word that came up just a couple times

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
 in three verses?

121
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,880
 Starts with an I.

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,060
 Image.

123
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,740
 Chapter one, verses 27 and 28,

124
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,100
 "In the image of God, you were created,

125
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,420
 "male and female, in the image of God, he created them."

126
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,560
 Now what does that mean?

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,580
 I wanna sit there for a second,

128
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,780
 because I know I didn't have a ton of church context

129
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,320
 growing up, I didn't start walking with the Lord 'til 19,

130
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,400
 but I had enough to kind of feel like

131
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,740
 maybe I heard some of these ideas.

132
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,420
 And at least to me growing up,

133
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,100
 I always was either taught or just assumed

134
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,120
 that the image of God in the scriptures

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,740
 was about characteristics of God passed on to us.

136
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,920
 Does that make sense?

137
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,660
 Kind of like God is loving, God is holy,

138
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,220
 God is creative, all these different types of things.

139
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,780
 And so that's what it means to be created

140
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,940
 in the image of God, right?

141
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,380
 That's kind of just how I assumed what that phrase meant.

142
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,580
 Now at some level that's true,

143
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,380
 but that's not what the text is trying to say.

144
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,840
 That's almost a byproduct definition.

145
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,620
 Image of God in the ancient Near East,

146
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,460
 which literally again is where this text

147
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,700
 was written out of and from,

148
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,700
 you have to understand the context,

149
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,580
 was actually not about characteristics,

150
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,780
 but it was about vocation.

151
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,300
 Vocation, job, right?

152
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,080
 You have been given a job to do

153
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,400
 because you are a royal signpost,

154
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,320
 a royal ambassador of creator Yahweh.

155
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,500
 Are you tracking?

156
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,520
 That God has actually commissioned you

157
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,720
 and having the image of God in you

158
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
 means you are to be a small divine reflector,

159
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,160
 or I mean a reflector of the divine.

160
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,200
 And so whether that's in relationships, by the way,

161
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,680
 or whether that's in your job,

162
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,920
 whether that's how you treat money,

163
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,160
 you are to be a divine reflector in your world,

164
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,700
 in your context, in your city.

165
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
 Is that true?

166
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
 Are you trying to reflect God's image

167
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,740
 or are you resisting the image he puts on you?

168
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,100
 That's by the way how you define sin,

169
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,300
 is resisting the image he has put on you.

170
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,740
 Do you reflect who he is and how he has created you to be?

171
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,580
 It has to do with your vocation.

172
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,660
 He has given us jobs to do.

173
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,860
 Another way to think about it is,

174
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,500
 again, I always had this idea that,

175
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
 like here's the question,

176
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,140
 what would you say peak spirituality is?

177
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,660
 What would you say peak Christianity is?

178
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,000
 Most of us, if we think of like the high moment,

179
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,980
 it's what?

180
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,820
 It's what?

181
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,740
 Maybe sitting in our prayer closet,

182
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,460
 praying for five hours, listening to Hillsong,

183
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,300
 and maybe Maverick City.

184
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,620
 Anyone else?

185
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,820
 Great music, by the way.

186
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,100
 But I might just critique that a little bit

187
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,560
 and say that's not what it means to be human,

188
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,020
 that's actually what it means to be an angel.

189
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,580
 You ever thought about that?

190
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,980
 So what does it mean to be an angel in scripture?

191
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,940
 Anytime an angel shows up in scripture,

192
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,620
 what are they doing?

193
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,460
 They're basically kneeling.

194
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,960
 I mean, besides the few times they have a human interaction

195
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,540
 when they're around God, what are they doing?

196
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,780
 They're kneeling at his feet, worshiping him.

197
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,700
 Now, is that a part of what it means to be human?

198
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,900
 Yes, absolutely.

199
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,220
 But does Genesis say that's what it means to be human?

200
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,980
 I don't see that anywhere in Genesis.

201
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,220
 What do I see?

202
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,980
 You are created as an image bearer of God,

203
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,460
 which means you are a human, and human means to work.

204
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,500
 Go do the job I have given you.

205
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,740
 So many times we over-spiritualize

206
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,920
 this version of Christianity

207
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,380
 and under-spiritualize this version,

208
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,100
 which is God has given you a job.

209
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,140
 That is to properly reflect him

210
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,600
 in every avenue of your life.

211
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,940
 Another way to think about it is

212
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,340
 being an image bearer of God,

213
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
 and again, in relationships,

214
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,260
 is almost like being a 45-degree angled mirror.

215
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,780
 I know that's a weird way to put it, right?

216
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,320
 But any geometry students in here,

217
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,340
 if God is kind of like giving his love,

218
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,580
 his goodness, his grace, and who he is

219
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,120
 and his character down on a 45-degree angled mirror,

220
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
 where does it go?

221
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,460
 Any geometry students out there?

222
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,000
 45-degree angled mirror, it comes down, it goes out.

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,540
 Right, so we are to reflect,

224
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,580
 we are to absorb all that he is,

225
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,500
 all that he, who he is,

226
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,100
 and what he has for us in creation,

227
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,540
 and reflect it out into the world.

228
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,180
 But by the way, it's a two-way street.

229
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,260
 What it means to be an image bearer

230
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,680
 is actually to take all of creation,

231
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,180
 and do what?

232
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,380
 Create order out of chaos

233
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,340
 and reflect it back up to him in worship.

234
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,220
 So it's a two-way street

235
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,820
 of that's what it means to be an image bearer.

236
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,460
 One other fun fact,

237
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,660
 do you know when they've done a lot of digging

238
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,580
 and archeological sites in antiquity,

239
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,820
 and they find old statues and ruins

240
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,580
 of statues of old Roman emperors,

241
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,700
 like a Caesar or a Nero or something like that?

242
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,140
 Do you know whenever they find those statues,

243
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,900
 it's always thousands of miles away from Rome,

244
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,340
 and they've never found one statue in Rome

245
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,380
 of Caesar or Nero?

246
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,660
 Now why is that?

247
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,700
 Why would you guess

248
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,100
 that there's a bunch of Caesar statues

249
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,340
 thousands of miles away in the farthest colony,

250
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,120
 but none in Rome, why?

251
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,860
 Where do you not need a statue of Caesar?

252
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,020
 Where the real guy lives, right?

253
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,240
 Are you tracking?

254
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,780
 But where do you need one?

255
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,940
 In the farther outermost points of the colonies

256
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,220
 to do what, by the way?

257
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,780
 Why do we have statues out there?

258
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,140
 Hey, this is who is in charge.

259
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,740
 This is who the authority is.

260
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,540
 This is the king.

261
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,180
 I think that's a really interesting way, by the way,

262
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,060
 to think about what it means to be an image bearer

263
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,640
 or a human in the heaven and earth dimension, okay?

264
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,620
 That it specifically says

265
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,940
 God created the heavens and the earth,

266
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,720
 and that humans were created on earth

267
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,700
 to be those outermost statues that do what?

268
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,700
 What's our job?

269
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,580
 To live in a way that says what?

270
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,500
 This is who's in charge.

271
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,700
 This is who is in charge.

272
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,500
 Are you doing that in your relationships?

273
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,780
 In the way that you're going about dating,

274
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
 in the way you're treating her,

275
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,380
 in the way you're treating him?

276
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,700
 Are you showing who is in charge?

277
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,660
 Yahweh or you, by the way?

278
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,420
 'Cause there's only one true king.

279
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,580
 But we all have a choice to show who that is.

280
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,740
 And I'll just go with that one step farther too, by the way.

281
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,820
 That's an interesting way to think about sin and hell,

282
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,340
 if you think about it.

283
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,980
 When a statue is in the farthest outermost points

284
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,900
 of a colony, and let's say a new empire

285
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,820
 takes over that colony,

286
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,700
 and Rome is no longer in charge there,

287
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,300
 two things, there's two possibilities

288
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,260
 that would happen to that statue, what?

289
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,700
 One, the enemy either just tears it down,

290
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,060
 or two, because they're not that,

291
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,180
 they don't care about Caesar,

292
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,580
 they no longer maintain it, and it begins to crumble.

293
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,340
 What a fascinating picture of sin.

294
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,100
 What a fascinating picture of sin.

295
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,460
 That when you stop reflecting God's image,

296
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,900
 and you take on something else in your heart,

297
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,140
 and you give it ultimate allegiance,

298
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,500
 then you begin to crumble your humanness.

299
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,580
 Or in a way, the enemy actually wants to attack it

300
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,780
 and tear you down.

301
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,460
 And I think, by the way, that's an interesting look at hell.

302
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,380
 Hell is nothing more than basically God saying,

303
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,340
 you don't want the image of me on you anymore?

304
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,180
 Okay.

305
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,420
 And he just takes the entire image off.

306
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,860
 And there's historical precedent, by the way,

307
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,340
 for that, C.S. Lewis, Tim Keller,

308
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,420
 some of the early church fathers,

309
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,940
 that's how they would describe it.

310
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,580
 Hell is this gnarly place where it's actually God saying,

311
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,420
 you don't want my image on you anymore?

312
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,840
 Okay, fine.

313
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,820
 What would we be like without the image of God?

314
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
 I don't know, but I don't wanna see it.

315
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,980
 And again, so many of us,

316
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,540
 in the choices we're making with our sexuality,

317
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,140
 with our bodies, with our hearts,

318
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,940
 with our thoughts, and with our minds,

319
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,540
 because we are not showing

320
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,140
 and being under the authority of God,

321
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,420
 we are crumbling our humanness.

322
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,420
 We are eroding and destroying ourselves

323
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,660
 by the decisions we're making

324
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,380
 by not being under the authority

325
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,700
 and the reign and rule of God.

326
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,900
 That's what it means to be an image bearer.

327
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
 Another way, the last way I'll put it

328
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,100
 before the next point is,

329
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,580
 when you're an image bearer,

330
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,300
 your life and your body is telling a story.

331
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,860
 Your life and your body is telling a story.

332
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,400
 Let it be the true one.

333
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,940
 Let it be the right one.

334
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,240
 Let it be the one of human flourishing and goodness.

335
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,120
 Another way to say it is,

336
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,840
 don't let your body say something that your life isn't.

337
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,320
 Anyone who's having sex before marriage,

338
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,080
 you're basically just letting your body tell a lie.

339
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,720
 You're basically saying, you know,

340
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,380
 I don't wanna be with you for life.

341
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,360
 I don't wanna join in a covenant.

342
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,640
 I don't wanna do all these things,

343
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,400
 but I'm gonna let my body say that that's true.

344
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,080
 I'm gonna let my body tell that story

345
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,200
 when nothing else in my life tells that story.

346
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,840
 God's a cohesive God, by the way.

347
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,160
 He's a God of unity,

348
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,920
 where he actually created sexuality

349
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
 to not be this random thing that's arbitrary,

350
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,580
 but actually for it to be a picture

351
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,800
 that's lining up with everything else

352
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,680
 that's already happening.

353
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,200
 That we are under a covenant together.

354
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,400
 That we are brought together in joinment, right?

355
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,040
 In the scriptures, the two will become what?

356
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,600
 One flesh.

357
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,000
 In sexuality, in finances, in life, in emotions,

358
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,400
 whatever it is, there is a merging

359
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,560
 of two people becoming one.

360
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,460
 Don't let your body tell a lie.

361
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,600
 Point two, God seemed to say here,

362
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,160
 and then also in chapter two,

363
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,160
 that he gave them a massive, enormous job to do,

364
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
 and that they can't do it alone,

365
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
 so he actually creates a team.

366
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
 He doesn't just create Adam and say,

367
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,400
 okay, now go do what I just asked you to do.

368
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,840
 He immediately says, specifically there,

369
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,280
 but also in Genesis two, around 13 and 14,

370
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,120
 that you cannot do this alone, and so what?

371
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,120
 I have created you to be a team.

372
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,160
 I have created a distinct, different individual from you

373
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,520
 that you can merge together with her

374
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,480
 and go on mission together.

375
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,480
 God created us in our relationships to be a team.

376
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,320
 When you're dating, when you're in that season

377
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,180
 of looking for someone you wanna spend

378
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,520
 the rest of your life with,

379
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,200
 the best thing you should be asking is,

380
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,280
 does this person make me a better team?

381
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,600
 A better person?

382
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
 Do they actually take me, I don't wanna say it

383
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,760
 in like an egotistical way,

384
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
 but like, does this person make me better?

385
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,280
 Does that make sense?

386
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,560
 Like, do they make me better spiritually,

387
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,120
 emotionally, and all these different types of things?

388
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,440
 Do they actually create,

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,760
 do they make me more into the image of God

390
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,840
 by being merged with them?

391
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,520
 That's a question you should ask.

392
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,360
 But you know what's funny is,

393
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,340
 the Western narratives tend to be the opposite.

394
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,140
 We're not looking for teams, we're looking for clones.

395
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
 Is that not true?

396
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,500
 The Western narrative of romance is,

397
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,000
 I just want someone like me

398
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
 so that I don't have to wrestle with any of my crap.

399
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,680
 Right?

400
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,200
 If that person looks like me, talks like me,

401
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
 acts like me, and never annoys me,

402
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,400
 well then I don't have to deal with any of my crap.

403
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,680
 Isn't the team an opposite, the opposite truth?

404
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,220
 What does any sports team do?

405
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,720
 They actually cherish and celebrate what?

406
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,800
 When someone is different than them.

407
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,220
 They actually say, I have enormous gaps.

408
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,920
 I cannot play every position.

409
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,980
 So I need someone that can play a different position.

410
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,720
 I need someone that can fill those gaps.

411
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,620
 I need someone that has a different skill set.

412
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,320
 Both, man and woman, should be talking like that

413
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,160
 and thinking like that.

414
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,220
 That actually, instead of us wanting someone more like us,

415
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,940
 we should want someone that specifically is different

416
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,940
 so that we can be a more rounded team

417
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,880
 to go on the mission God has for us.

418
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,280
 God wants to send you on mission,

419
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,000
 and marriage is essentially creating a team

420
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 for you to accomplish what he has for you.

421
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,620
 Do you believe in that, and do you trust in that?

422
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,760
 Another way to think, too, is that God,

423
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,460
 so many of us, we think love is face to face.

424
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,320
 If only I can find a relationship

425
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,420
 where we're just face to face,

426
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,240
 and we just stare lovingly into each other's eyes,

427
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,260
 and watch Netflix, and rom-coms, and all these things.

428
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,380
 By the way, speaking of rom-coms,

429
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,500
 that's like a dead genre now, doesn't that kinda suck?

430
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,640
 Those were amazing back then,

431
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,220
 and they just stopped making them.

432
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,360
 What was that one with Rebel Wilson, though,

433
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,280
 where they kinda spoofed it?

434
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
 Hilarious, you should watch it.

435
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,680
 I can't remember if it's R, though, so maybe not.

436
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,520
 Anyways, okay.

437
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,060
 Tangent.

438
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,600
 But so many of us, we think that love,

439
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,800
 or marriage, is only about face to face,

440
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,860
 when in reality, specifically in Genesis,

441
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
 it's actually shoulder to shoulder.

442
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,680
 It's not about looking across the aisle

443
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,380
 for someone to complete you or fulfill you,

444
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,880
 but it's actually shoulder to shoulder,

445
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,100
 who can I go do God's work with?

446
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,100
 Who can I actually accomplish the mission with?

447
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,380
 Who actually levels each other up?

448
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,140
 That's who I want to join myself with.

449
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,280
 And by the way, the antithesis is also a helpful diagnostic.

450
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,580
 Who makes you worse?

451
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,140
 Who just erodes the image of God in you?

452
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,400
 Who absolutely just shames you

453
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,320
 for what you feel like your calling is,

454
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,900
 or who you're created to be, or where you wanna go,

455
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,580
 or the dreams God's laid on your heart?

456
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
 If you're in a dating relationship,

457
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,260
 and you feel like that stuff is getting sunk,

458
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,260
 and oppressed, and kind of put down,

459
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,500
 you need to break up immediately, okay?

460
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,940
 - Amen, brother! - Thank you.

461
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,940
 (laughing)

462
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,380
 You felt that, you felt that.

463
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,940
 Glad I'm not alone, thank you.

464
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,580
 But it's true, it's true.

465
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,460
 Or you could say too, especially for the ladies,

466
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,380
 this is a really helpful one,

467
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,620
 and I guess you could do it on reverse,

468
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,500
 you could do it both,

469
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,740
 but another helpful diagnostic, if you're dating,

470
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,900
 is say, okay, if we get married,

471
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,620
 and we have kids that are exactly like that other person,

472
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,260
 so ladies, okay, if we get married, and I have a son,

473
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,340
 and my son turns out to be exactly like my husband,

474
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,480
 does that make you cringe, or make you excited?

475
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,540
 If that makes you cringe,

476
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,340
 I think you know what you should do.

477
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,420
 But so many of us, we stay in these relationships

478
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,220
 for I have no idea why reasons,

479
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,900
 when we know that person's holding us down,

480
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,260
 we know that person is not activating us in the spirit,

481
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,860
 and allowing us to go on mission together.

482
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,180
 You know they don't make you better.

483
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,700
 You have to ask those hard questions now,

484
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,260
 'cause can I just say too, by the way,

485
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,480
 if you're not asking it now,

486
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,700
 it'll just get 10 times worse in marriage.

487
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,900
 10 times worse.

488
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,360
 This is the time to ask the hard questions.

489
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,420
 This is the time to make the hard decisions,

490
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,580
 when you are dating,

491
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,020
 and looking for someone to partner with on God's mission.

492
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,200
 Point three, he then gives them a specific domain,

493
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,660
 and job title, in what we just read.

494
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,220
 It says be fruitful and multiply, number one,

495
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,540
 and then number two, it says he put them

496
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,460
 in the Garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.

497
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,140
 What I like to say is, we're all gardeners.

498
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,380
 We all are gardeners, according to Genesis.

499
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,300
 What does it mean to be a gardener?

500
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,220
 In the actual technical definition,

501
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,140
 a gardener is someone who basically takes raw materials,

502
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,940
 and then uses some of the outside resources as well,

503
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,320
 sun, rain, et cetera, like that.

504
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,020
 They take those raw materials, and what do they do with it?

505
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,840
 They do two things.

506
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,060
 They either one, make something beautiful, right?

507
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,500
 Something that's just compelling and powerful,

508
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 like a flower bed, or something like that,

509
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,380
 or, what?

510
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,740
 Or they make something that is nourishing and feeds you,

511
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,360
 agriculture, crops, et cetera.

512
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,660
 The job of a gardener is to make something beautiful,

513
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,860
 or to make something that feeds you.

514
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,340
 Now, all of us, that's a really helpful definition

515
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,500
 for what it means for, again, your vocation, for your life.

516
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,980
 The question is, what is your specific garden?

517
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,680
 What domain has God called you to,

518
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,460
 whether it's law, whether it's medicine,

519
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
 whether it's the creative arts, whether it's finance,

520
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
 I don't know what it is,

521
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,700
 but that is a garden that you can actually worship God in

522
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,340
 by creating order out of chaos,

523
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,580
 creating something that's beautiful,

524
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,300
 or creating something that nourishes people,

525
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,020
 spiritually, emotionally, physically, whatever it is.

526
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,840
 What is your garden?

527
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,460
 And a helpful question when you're dating is,

528
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,940
 do you have the same garden as the other person?

529
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,820
 You don't have to have the same job as them,

530
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,260
 but there should be a big enough fence

531
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,380
 where we want to play together in here.

532
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,180
 We wanna build together in here.

533
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,380
 We wanna create something that God has asked us to do

534
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,660
 in this boundary realm.

535
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,620
 But if you feel like you're on opposite ends of the spectrum

536
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,880
 or doing, you know, totally going, pulling opposite ways,

537
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,200
 then that probably might not be a wise decision.

538
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,740
 There's something about God that he calls them to merge,

539
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
 and then what does he do?

540
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,100
 And then it says, he literally places them.

541
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,560
 That's what it says, he places them in the Garden of Eden

542
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,520
 to work it and to keep it.

543
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,940
 So he merges them first,

544
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,140
 then he places them in the garden to work together.

545
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,420
 We are given gardens to steward,

546
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,180
 and marriage is about being on mission together.

547
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,620
 So ask yourself what that is, what that looks like,

548
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,300
 who that is, is that person,

549
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,040
 maybe that person, you haven't even met that person yet,

550
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,740
 right, or whatever it is.

551
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,740
 But God is calling you to be on mission.

552
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,620
 Imagine if a team, imagine if a sports team

553
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,800
 just hung out in the locker room all day

554
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,140
 and just kind of told stories to each other.

555
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,740
 Would that be weird?

556
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
 Right?

557
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,700
 Oh man, I love you, bro, I love you, bro.

558
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,220
 Hey, you're awesome, you're awesome.

559
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,500
 Do you think that'd be weird sooner or later?

560
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,260
 Probably actually sooner, right?

561
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,980
 Why?

562
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,420
 What's a team supposed to do?

563
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,020
 A team's supposed to go play the game.

564
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,780
 A team's supposed to go win the championship.

565
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,700
 But so many of us, that's pretty much what I just described,

566
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,240
 what we actually believe is the ideal

567
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,260
 of romance and relationships.

568
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,300
 Let's just sit in the locker room

569
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,820
 and just tell each other good things.

570
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,060
 Now by the way, can I just be clear

571
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,100
 that that, as well as the face-to-face

572
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,780
 is the other metaphor for it, is necessary.

573
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,420
 But I would consider that the glue

574
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,460
 and the goodness God has created for relationships

575
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,780
 for you to go do the bigger thing,

576
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,460
 which is be on mission together.

577
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,820
 Now if you go on mission together

578
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,220
 without the face-to-face, then it's dry,

579
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,060
 it's hard, it's difficult, and without the glue,

580
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,540
 there is usually fracturing.

581
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,420
 So they are meant to go together,

582
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,240
 but a lot of us, we are totally fine

583
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,020
 with just the sitting, hanging out,

584
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,380
 and just staring lovingly into each other's eyes.

585
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,340
 When that's more like the locker room where you prep,

586
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,140
 you check out the whiteboard, you run up the plays,

587
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,580
 then you go on into the game.

588
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,540
 Then you go play the game.

589
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,700
 Then you go pursue what God has for you.

590
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,380
 And so that's what we have to think about

591
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,100
 when we read Genesis and think about that,

592
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,000
 that God is giving you a garden to go play the game.

593
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,740
 So what would that be?

594
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,660
 And think about, when you think about that too,

595
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,980
 a couple helpful questions you can maybe ask yourself

596
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,620
 in that is just talk to the person more

597
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,660
 with asking them dreams, hopes, visions, et cetera.

598
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,740
 I think so many times I hear dating relationships,

599
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,700
 and you'll be like, have you asked them what they wanna do

600
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
 or where they wanna be in 10 years?

601
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,780
 I'm not saying they have to have a perfect answer to that,

602
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,020
 by the way, 'cause does anyone else hate that question?

603
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,140
 You're, where are you gonna be in five years?

604
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,660
 Like, I don't know, and any answer I said,

605
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,340
 I definitely didn't look like that five years ago.

606
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,740
 Now, but it is helpful in just like stirring the heart,

607
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,460
 stirring the mind of are they going somewhere?

608
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,380
 A really good word for it is trajectory, trajectory.

609
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,740
 Are you on a trajectory that this person is on?

610
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,620
 Because you should be going the same direction,

611
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,260
 either in maturity level, in a spiritual maturity level,

612
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,140
 or in a vocational level, but going the same direction

613
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,680
 on a certain trajectory is deeply, deeply important.

614
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,620
 And so that's what we have to ask.

615
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,980
 Point four is this, then what we see too is that,

616
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,820
 what do we see with Jesus?

617
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,440
 That Jesus comes in the Gospels

618
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,540
 and beautifully shows us what?

619
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,940
 That we don't have what it takes,

620
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,580
 that we are not good enough, that we have failed,

621
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,600
 but what?

622
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,780
 His love is there for us.

623
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,060
 He meets us in this place and He wants to know you.

624
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,560
 Another way to think about it is those three points

625
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,540
 I just named, Jesus perfectly fulfills.

626
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,020
 Have you ever thought about who's the truest image of God?

627
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,100
 Jesus.

628
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,160
 He is the actual fulfiller of the image.

629
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,220
 It even says that in Colossians,

630
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,560
 that He is the image of the invisible God,

631
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,320
 not only as an image of God,

632
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,760
 but He also as the truly human one,

633
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,700
 showed us what it's like,

634
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,520
 that He was the perfect divine reflection.

635
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,680
 He was the perfect divine reflection that comes down

636
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,160
 and goes out towards us.

637
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,920
 Then He doesn't go solo, He goes on a team mission

638
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,020
 with the Holy Spirit and the Father, constantly

639
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,420
 referencing them, constantly saying He needs them,

640
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,680
 constantly saying He needs to meet with them,

641
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,020
 and then what?

642
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,800
 And then point number three, He then reveals His garden,

643
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,940
 which is what?

644
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,020
 All of us, our hearts, our minds, our sinful nature,

645
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,180
 the earth, that He is the ultimate maker of order

646
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,500
 out of chaos in our lives, in our marriages,

647
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,700
 in our dating relationships, in our finances,

648
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,020
 in all these different types of things

649
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,020
 that God is for us, God is with us,

650
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,960
 and that any place that we failed

651
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,080
 in being these proper divine reflections,

652
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,500
 He has fulfilled for us by His grace.

653
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,760
 I think about, we can fast forward Genesis one,

654
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
 Genesis two, and then Genesis three.

655
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,260
 What happens in Genesis three?

656
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,240
 The curse.

657
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,040
 So they're given this big mandate,

658
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,800
 they're given this big mission,

659
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,960
 they're given this big job, and they fail.

660
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,400
 They eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

661
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,800
 They say, I can do it on my own,

662
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,720
 which so many of us, we're still living that lie today.

663
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,100
 In relationships, in our sexuality,

664
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,240
 I can do it on my own.

665
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,400
 And it's this whisper from Satan,

666
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,720
 or the Satan figure, actually, is what it is in Hebrew.

667
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,320
 Do you know, by the way, total trivia and random known fact,

668
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,640
 but we call him Satan, but you know that actual figure

669
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
 in scripture has no proper name, right?

670
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,440
 It's the serpent, or the Satan in Hebrew,

671
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,280
 which just literally means the accuser.

672
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,100
 Satan, we call him that, I'm just gonna call him that

673
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,560
 right now just for reference sake,

674
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,520
 he actually doesn't have a true name.

675
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,320
 And there's actually God trying to do a point there,

676
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,420
 by the way.

677
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,720
 What gets names in scripture?

678
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,760
 We literally actually just read it,

679
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,720
 it's a couple verses after Genesis one, 28 and 29.

680
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,000
 What gets names?

681
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
 Anything that's created, anything that shows order,

682
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,580
 anything that's put in the garden.

683
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,860
 Who's the antithesis of order?

684
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,600
 Who's the king of chaos?

685
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,800
 The accuser, the serpent, the Satan figure.

686
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,280
 And so it's actually, I think, God, in some way,

687
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,000
 and the writers of the scripture is kinda saying,

688
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,880
 he is so the antithesis of chaos and evil

689
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
 that he doesn't deserve a name.

690
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,000
 He doesn't deserve a name, because he only seeks

691
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,280
 to kill and destroy and steal.

692
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,760
 He only seeks to unravel.

693
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,700
 His job is to breed chaos in our lives,

694
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,080
 in our relationships, and he does it

695
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,920
 almost primarily by whispering in our ear,

696
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,800
 you can do it alone, you can do it on your own,

697
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
 and you are the king of your own life.

698
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,080
 Those are his primary tools and his primary whispers

699
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
 that he constantly is putting into our ear,

700
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,840
 and nowhere does it wreak more havoc than in relationships.

701
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,960
 I don't know about you, but I mean, I had a horrible,

702
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
 like my childhood was pretty horrible,

703
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,400
 and I think about like, no one really walks

704
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
 with the Lord in my family, right?

705
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,960
 My parents never got married.

706
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,560
 You know, my mom had been to like juvenile hall,

707
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,640
 my dad had been to prison, just a really, really,

708
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
 really pretty rough upbringing, and I look back on that,

709
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,200
 and I'm just like, yep, rings true,

710
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,300
 that Satan just breeds chaos and disorder.

711
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,240
 Like so many of us, is that not our story?

712
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
 Maybe even you had a healthy family,

713
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,600
 but you never felt known, you never felt seen,

714
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,520
 you felt like the pressure was insurmountable,

715
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,040
 you felt like you could never actually perform good enough

716
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,760
 for your parents to love you, or maybe it was

717
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,520
 severely broken by the world's standards.

718
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,040
 Whatever it is, so many of us, I think it would be clear

719
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,220
 for us to say that yes, objectively,

720
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,200
 we understand sin can erode relationships,

721
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
 even if we're not thinking about ours,

722
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,920
 but the ones above us, how it's informed us,

723
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,080
 how it's ruined us, how it's wounded us,

724
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:10,240
 that it can hurt us, that have we not seen, basically,

725
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,920
 it's funny how we just keep making the same mistakes

726
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,160
 generationally, is what I'm trying to say.

727
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,040
 So many of us, have we not seen that when you say

728
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
 that you're the king of your own life,

729
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,800
 or you make your own decisions, or you don't listen

730
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 to God's blueprint, you don't step into God's design,

731
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,520
 it does not end well, it breeds chaos and disorder

732
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,460
 and hurt and pain.

733
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,240
 It's the brokenness of this word shalom in the garden,

734
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,200
 that this order, this dance of creation,

735
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,700
 that when you are living within God's design,

736
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,300
 it's like a music, it's like rhythmic, it's beautiful,

737
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,540
 it's compelling, but there's something about sin

738
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,540
 that breaks the music, and just wreaks havoc on our lives.

739
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,900
 And music is a really good metaphor, too, by the way,

740
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,260
 that music is kind of objective in the sense of the rhythm,

741
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,580
 meaning it is just, a rhythm would just be constant,

742
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,960
 a beat, right?

743
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,120
 It would just be going at a certain way.

744
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,500
 We don't get to make up the music,

745
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,680
 is what I'm trying to say.

746
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,600
 You don't get to make up the music.

747
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,420
 Now, you can be creative of how you dance in the music,

748
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,380
 right, and it might not be good,

749
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,380
 we got some white people in the room, so I understand,

750
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,380
 but, I mean, come on, we've all seen that guy

751
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,300
 at the wedding, right, where it's like,

752
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,100
 I don't think, no, no, no, okay.

753
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,180
 You know who you are, you know who you are.

754
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:31,860
 So, when music is playing, you cannot make up the music,

755
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,080
 your job is to submit to music and dance within it,

756
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,660
 but you are allowed to be creative within that submission.

757
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,980
 Again, I think that's a beautiful picture of relationships,

758
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,580
 God's design, that they are not rigid.

759
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,340
 God's designed so much in our culture,

760
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,660
 it's that God is constrictive, God is oppressive,

761
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,700
 God is, you know, rigid.

762
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,580
 Now, there might be restraint that he calls this to,

763
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,020
 and I would believe it does feel like that

764
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,140
 and sound like that in our culture, and it absolutely does,

765
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,420
 but within that restraint, there is freedom,

766
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,260
 just like someone who's enjoying dancing.

767
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,120
 You're not saying it's rigid to not dance on beat,

768
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,880
 you're just saying you look stupid.

769
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,760
 You look ridiculous, that's not how you do it,

770
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,860
 it's that simple.

771
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,780
 That's not rigid, that's just almost like a law of nature,

772
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,120
 that just music works in a certain way

773
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,040
 and you can be creative within it.

774
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,920
 And so that's God's design, again,

775
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,040
 for relationships and for us.

776
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,480
 One more tangent I just thought of,

777
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,160
 and then I'll close here in a sec,

778
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,280
 is that's actually a big point in our culture, right?

779
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,740
 That our culture's highest value,

780
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,680
 specifically with the 35 and under crowd,

781
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,880
 which that would be me and peers and stuff,

782
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,920
 would be that nothing should inhibit my freedom.

783
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,240
 Nothing should inhibit my freedom.

784
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,120
 That's like the highest Western ideal,

785
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,360
 and are we not seeing that play out

786
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
 in all these cultural battles, right?

787
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,160
 That the highest ideal in the West

788
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,320
 is that I should be able to do what I want,

789
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,840
 when I want, how I want, and anything that constricts that

790
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,560
 is evil or wrong or oppressive or from the patriarchy.

791
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,520
 Right, I thought you guys just loved, okay, never mind.

792
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,180
 Okay, we're gonna move on from that one, that word, okay.

793
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,660
 But in fact, that's not true freedom.

794
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,060
 True freedom always involves restraint at some level.

795
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,940
 A good metaphor would be like skydiving, right?

796
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,700
 Now, when you skydive,

797
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,300
 that's like the epitome of freedom, right?

798
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,500
 You're just jumping out of a plane,

799
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,260
 flying through the air, it feels super free,

800
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,460
 exhilarating and amazing, there's no restraints.

801
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,260
 Well, kind of, is there?

802
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,760
 What's kind of restraining you?

803
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
 A parachute.

804
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
 Now, if you wanted to be a little bit more free

805
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,040
 'cause that kind of felt like it was getting a little tight

806
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,080
 and you might chafe and you wanna take it off,

807
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,220
 what's gonna happen to you?

808
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,060
 You're gonna die.

809
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,420
 So in that scenario, it sounds like restraint

810
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,400
 actually brings more freedom, are you tracking?

811
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,720
 In that scenario, it actually sounds like

812
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,120
 if I submit to the restraints,

813
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,320
 I will actually be able to enjoy this way more.

814
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,280
 Same with sex, same with relationships, same with dating,

815
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,140
 same with marriage.

816
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,060
 That when you understand God's design

817
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,680
 and when you understand the restraints

818
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
 he has placed in there,

819
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,720
 you will be able to enjoy it way better.

820
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,920
 It's actually God saying, play, enjoy, eat,

821
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,880
 be fruitful, be multiply, this is amazing, incredible.

822
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,000
 But within this context, you go outside of that context

823
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
 and you're just playing against the music.

824
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,780
 God, the thing I want you to hear tonight is,

825
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,020
 as he's playing a music,

826
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,020
 are you dancing to it in your relationship?

827
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,180
 Are you trying to tune your ear to it every morning?

828
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,420
 What a cool way to think about prayer, by the way.

829
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,900
 This is a time to listen to God

830
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,220
 and almost be a tuning fork to his music,

831
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,700
 his voice, his love over me.

832
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,300
 That's what it means to live in a healthy way

833
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,620
 in that blueprint.

834
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,160
 And I'll end with this.

835
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,460
 So we get to Genesis three, the curse comes,

836
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,700
 and there's this really fascinating thing that shows up

837
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,100
 how God responds to the first human sinning

838
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,920
 that I think we just kind of skip over

839
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,900
 because we kind of just assume,

840
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,140
 well, yeah, we've read the rest of the story,

841
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,580
 of course, God's loving and kind, et cetera,

842
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,900
 but let's just go back a little bit, okay?

843
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,140
 So they sin, but by the way,

844
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,980
 did that not seem like they sinned in five seconds,

845
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,540
 anyone else?

846
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,220
 Like it was so quick.

847
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,380
 He said, do not eat of the tree,

848
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,340
 and what'd they do five seconds later?

849
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,740
 They ate of the tree.

850
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,660
 Now, God would have every reason,

851
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,220
 especially with that royal language in Genesis,

852
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,220
 that these are the royal ambassadors of Yahweh himself,

853
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,220
 maybe at a high-level justice way, I don't know,

854
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,340
 to just go Thanos and snap his finger and they disappear,

855
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,460
 I don't know, but he would have been justified

856
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,620
 in responding that way, that's what I'm trying to say.

857
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,300
 But yet, if we hadn't read the rest of the scriptures,

858
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,580
 I feel like you would be on the edge of your seat

859
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,980
 of like, what is God going to do in this moment?

860
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,840
 These image bearers, these royal priests,

861
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,500
 these divine representatives,

862
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,220
 I mean, the representatives of the divine,

863
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,300
 these image bearers, they just usurped

864
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,300
 and kind of went against the king.

865
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,940
 What is he going to do?

866
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,860
 Now, what does he do?

867
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,220
 He does something very weird.

868
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,420
 What's God's very first response

869
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,700
 to the first time sin enters into the world?

870
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,300
 What's he do?

871
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,260
 He asks a question.

872
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,540
 That's his first response.

873
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,820
 The very first time sin enters into the world,

874
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,500
 after he just created everything,

875
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,700
 it was beautiful, it was amazing,

876
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,220
 it was awesome, and it was incredible,

877
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,580
 the very first thing God does is asks a question,

878
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,460
 two actually, but why is that weird?

879
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,000
 God should be never asking questions, amen?

880
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,360
 Isn't that kind of like against the,

881
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,380
 like, isn't that not really the,

882
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,700
 like, if you're God, you don't really need

883
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,940
 to be asking that, right?

884
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,300
 Unless what?

885
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,140
 Unless what?

886
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,620
 God is maybe asking rhetorically,

887
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,500
 or it's actually trying to show us something.

888
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,340
 Now, what was the question?

889
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,700
 What was the very first thing out of God's mouth?

890
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,820
 They sin, the curse breaks, everything,

891
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,680
 comes into the world, and then God comes looking for them

892
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,020
 in the garden, asks a question,

893
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,220
 and the question is what?

894
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,380
 Adam, where are you?

895
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,700
 Adam, where are you?

896
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,460
 Now, again, do you think he really needs to know?

897
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,420
 Like, hey, what bush, bro, I can't find you.

898
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,780
 (congregation laughing)

899
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,900
 Do you think he's legitimately asking,

900
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,260
 Adam, send me the GPS coordinates right now.

901
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,500
 Log into my Find My Friends app

902
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,020
 and let me know where you're at.

903
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,620
 No, again, unless God is rhetorically in that moment

904
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,500
 setting a precedent that we have to saturate ourselves in,

905
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
 and that is God actually calling them

906
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,380
 back to himself immediately.

907
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,460
 Immediately.

908
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,700
 He's actually saying, Adam, where are you?

909
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,660
 Where is my son?

910
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,500
 Where is my daughter?

911
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,580
 Why are you hiding?

912
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,020
 Why are you hiding?

913
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,300
 The first response from God is actually to go look from them

914
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,440
 and then to call them out of hiding.

915
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,220
 That's enormously incredible.

916
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,620
 Like his default position to sin,

917
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,780
 that's another way you could put it.

918
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,700
 His default, like how his first response to sin in the world

919
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,660
 is to go looking for them and call them out of it.

920
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,300
 Go looking for them, and by the way,

921
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,100
 he calls them by name, how beautiful is that?

922
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,220
 He calls you by name when he's calling you out of your sin,

923
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,580
 when he's calling you out of hiding,

924
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,100
 when he's calling you out of your shame,

925
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,140
 when he's calling you out of anything

926
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,340
 that is unraveling your humanness,

927
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,740
 breeding that chaos, breeding that disorder,

928
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,660
 he's calling you out of it.

929
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,980
 Tonight, maybe.

930
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,540
 Tonight.

931
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,420
 Masturbation, sleeping with your boyfriend

932
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,180
 or your girlfriend, whether it's something

933
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,100
 that was done to you in the past in an abusive way,

934
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,700
 whatever the shame is, whatever the behavior is,

935
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,740
 whatever it is, he's calling you out of it tonight.

936
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,380
 You can find healing tonight.

937
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,220
 Tonight.

938
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,580
 He says, where are you?

939
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,420
 And then they say we were hiding

940
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,020
 'cause we were naked and ashamed,

941
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,800
 and then he says a second question, which is what?

942
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,260
 Who told you you were naked?

943
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,500
 Again, it's God reiterating the primal voice

944
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,060
 over the human saying who told you you were naked?

945
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,540
 Who told you you weren't good enough?

946
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,180
 Who told you you were this, this, this, and this?

947
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,280
 I didn't, that wasn't my voice.

948
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,380
 That's a different voice.

949
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,300
 But that's not my voice.

950
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,180
 The very first voice over you cries love,

951
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,180
 goodness, image bearer, beloved, his.

952
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,700
 Do you believe that tonight?

953
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,620
 Do you believe that God is calling you out of darkness,

954
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,500
 out of sin, out of all of these things into goodness?

955
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,380
 He wants to plant you back in the garden

956
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,440
 equipped by the power of Jesus and the Holy Spirit

957
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,060
 to go on mission with him.

958
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,460
 And so I'll say this.

959
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,320
 When I think about that moment

960
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,120
 and thinking about Jesus calling us out of sin

961
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,420
 and our darkness, I think of the story of Jesus

962
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,420
 where the lady is coming to try to get to him

963
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,260
 and touches him, and what happens to her?

964
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,100
 Well, two things.

965
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,740
 First of all, how crazy is it that Jesus immediately says,

966
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,580
 "Who just touched me?"

967
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
 And he's in a crowd of a bajillion people.

968
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,540
 So it's like, well, bro, isn't everyone kind of, right?

969
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,060
 But he says, "Who touched me?"

970
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,980
 So it shows you his awareness and his power.

971
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,580
 And then, by the way, what's it say?

972
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,380
 She had been, I think, sick and bleeding for 14 years

973
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,580
 from what I can remember from the story.

974
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,620
 And then what's it say?

975
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,060
 Upon touching her, she is instantly healed.

976
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,020
 Instantly healed.

977
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,660
 Now, you know what's crazy about that story?

978
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,160
 Before the New Testament,

979
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,100
 darkness or uncleanliness tended to win.

980
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,380
 Now, here's what I mean by that.

981
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,880
 I don't mean that God wasn't powerful then

982
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,180
 or God wasn't healing, but just even ceremonially,

983
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,560
 according to the Torah, if something clean

984
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,180
 came in contact with something unclean in the Old Testament,

985
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,380
 almost every single time, if they were to touch

986
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,860
 an unclean and a clean person or thing or whatever,

987
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,700
 what would win?

988
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,460
 Meaning would both leave clean or would both leave unclean?

989
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,020
 Both would be made unclean.

990
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,660
 The uncleanliness would kind of like transpose itself, right?

991
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,900
 And you know what's crazy about Jesus in the New Testament?

992
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,980
 It's completely reversed.

993
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,980
 Anything that comes in contact with Jesus, what happens?

994
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,900
 Clean, instantly.

995
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,780
 Instantly healed, righteous, new, beloved, good,

996
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,780
 simply by reaching out and touching him.

997
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,660
 And so that's what I wanna leave you guys with tonight,

998
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,820
 and that's what I want you to think on

999
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,340
 and just sit on with this last song

1000
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,740
 that'll be here in a minute,

1001
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,900
 is have you first of all reached out and touched him?

1002
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,260
 Have you reached out and touched him?

1003
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,680
 Have you been made new?

1004
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,740
 Because the minute you say yes to Jesus

1005
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,780
 and all that unraveling that sin was doing,

1006
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,800
 you begin to start re-raveling in new creation.

1007
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
 That's what it means to walk with Jesus,

1008
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,580
 is all you're doing is re-raveling yourself.

1009
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,640
 I know it's a weird way to put it,

1010
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,540
 but you're re-raveling your imageness

1011
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,600
 to be made more in the image of who?

1012
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,040
 Him, and then when we resurrect and are fully glorified,

1013
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,640
 that job is perfected and done.

1014
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,840
 That job is perfected and done.

1015
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,000
 That's what it means to be an image bearer

1016
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,720
 under the submission and authority of Jesus.

1017
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,220
 So have you reached out and touched him?

1018
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,880
 And then if you have, have you been placed in that garden?

1019
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
 Do you understand that mission?

1020
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,180
 And are you on a trajectory of trying to find a teammate

1021
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,440
 that will take you in the direction God wants you

1022
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,480
 and make you better and be a partner

1023
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
 that'll actually go on mission with you

1024
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,500
 and not hold you down?

1025
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,320
 Let me pray for you guys.

1026
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,160
 Jesus,

1027
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,800
 I just pray for everyone in this room.

1028
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,360
 Lord, thinking, just feeling that weight right now

1029
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,220
 of the diversity of life story in this room,

1030
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,520
 whether it's a good family upbringing,

1031
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,000
 a bad family upbringing,

1032
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,800
 whether it's some serious dark stuff

1033
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,760
 that's been done against us,

1034
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,060
 whether it's some stuff that we have done

1035
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,200
 against other people,

1036
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,280
 whether there's maybe just even like something,

1037
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,560
 stuff that we don't feel like was crazy, bad,

1038
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,120
 or been done against us, but we just feel numb.

1039
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,500
 We just feel like we have what we should have

1040
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,500
 and what we need, but we just feel like we're empty.

1041
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,740
 We just feel numb.

1042
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,300
 And so, Lord, I just pray a blessing.

1043
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,020
 I pray a healing over everyone in this room tonight, Lord.

1044
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,040
 And as this song plays,

1045
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,520
 maybe we shout it out as a praise to you,

1046
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
 but maybe we let it wash over us as well and we just listen.

1047
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,100
 And that this song can maybe be a reminder

1048
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,340
 of that primal voice in the garden,

1049
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,940
 the first voice that says,

1050
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,140
 where are you?

1051
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,820
 You can come out of hiding.

1052
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,300
 And Lord, we thank you for the blueprint,

1053
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,620
 that the minute we come out of hiding,

1054
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,620
 we are touched, healed, renewed, and new,

1055
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,340
 and then we have the blueprint.

1056
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,900
 We can continue to take steps forward

1057
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,400
 to first of all, be on mission ourselves.

1058
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,320
 That Lord, you give us missions

1059
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,200
 as image bearers individually,

1060
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,300
 and that we can focus, we can point ourselves towards you,

1061
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,980
 and if you wanna bring someone to the left or to the right

1062
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,480
 to join in on that party, then amen, let it be so.

1063
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,180
 But Lord, let us be faithful either way,

1064
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,980
 in singleness, in relationships.

1065
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,540
 Let us be faithful, faithful with our bodies,

1066
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,780
 faithful with our thoughts.

1067
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,020
 Lord, let our bodies, our thoughts,

1068
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,500
 and our hearts and our minds

1069
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,880
 do exactly what we talked about in the beginning.

1070
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,840
 Say, this is who is in charge.

1071
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,740
 This is who is king.

1072
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,760
 Might we be image bearers and living statues going out

1073
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,880
 where people say, oh, that's what it looks like.

1074
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,860
 That's what divine love and goodness and blessing looks like.

1075
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,140
 That's what the king looks like.

1076
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,900
 That's what who I'm created to actually be like

1077
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,060
 maybe looks like, the one calling me

1078
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,260
 into love and forgiveness.

1079
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,660
 So Lord, we thank you for who you are

1080
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,020
 and what you've done for us.

1081
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,460
 In whom we pray, amen.
