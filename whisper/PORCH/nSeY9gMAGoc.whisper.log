[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   [Music]
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Well, how we doing porch?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Come on, let's go.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Hey, we are so glad that you are here tonight at the porch.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   My name is Josiah Jones, I have the privilege of being on staff
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   here leading our 200 leaders that make up this Tuesday night
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   gathering that we call the porch.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Can we just give a round of welcome for our leaders?
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Yeah, come on.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   The ones that are in the parking lot sweating, although we got a
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   cold front, praise God, right?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Those that are in the town center greeting you and those
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   that are ushering you to your seat, even in this moment.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Man, we are so grateful for the leaders that serve here at the porch.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Well, hey, we want to welcome you.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   You could be anywhere on a Tuesday night, especially if this is your
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   first time, thank you for choosing to be right here with us at the porch.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   It's a real honor and we know you could be in a lot of different places.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I want to give a shout out to our Porch Live locations, watching online,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Porch Live Boise, Idaho, Scottsdale, Arizona, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Midland,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Texas, and a whole host of others.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Can you give it up for our Porch Live locations?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Tonight is a really special night because you're going to get to hear
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   from a friend of ours at the porch.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   His name is Luke Lefevre.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And Luke is a friend, like I just said, of the porch.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He's with his wife Rebecca tonight.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And here's what you need to know about Luke and Rebecca.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Luke is 26 years old, lives in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Anybody from Nashville in the room tonight?
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Okay, a few of us.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And they have a daughter, Evelyn, who is 1 1/2.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And, man, they are here tonight because I believe that Luke has a call on
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   his life for this generation.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   He leads a young adult movement called Consecrate.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And God is using his voice all across the nation, I would even go as far
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   as to say all across the world, to call this generation to radical
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   holiness, to deep devotion to Jesus and his call and audacious faith.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And I believe he has a message tonight for us here on a Tuesday in
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   September that's going to call us to take next steps in our faith.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So before Luke comes up and gives the message, I want to pray.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And here's what I'm going to ask you.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm going to invite you to pray with me.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And I'm going to ask you first to pray for yourself as you ask the Lord
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   wherever you are in your faith or if this is your first time or your 50th
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   time that you just say, God, I'm available for the next 30 minutes.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I just want to hear from you.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And so would you take the next 30 seconds just to pray and say, Lord,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I'm available and I want to hear from you.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And help me to not have any distractions so I can be laser focused on what
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   your word has to say tonight.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Take 30 seconds and pray for that.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Then I'm going to ask that you would pray for Luke as he gets ready to come
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   up here, opens up God's word, that you would just ask the Lord to give
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   him his words, that any word that comes out of Luke's mouth would be words
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   from God.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And that he would give him boldness and courage to proclaim what he has laid
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   on Luke's heart.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   God in heaven, thank you for this night, a Tuesday in September 2023,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   that you have destined us to be at tonight.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   There is no chance that just people are here randomly.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   God, but you have divinely put them in this seat in Dallas, Texas,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and all across the nation to hear a message from Luke Lefevre.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And I pray, God, that you would use him mightily,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   that his words would be your words.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And God, that you would remove any distraction in this place.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And that we would grab on to everything that you would want us to grab on to
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   tonight.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And we would walk out of these doors ready and available for any call that
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   you would have on our life.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And God, you would use him in a way where you get much,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   much glory as a result of him being here.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And God, we would leave with a higher view of you and a lower view of
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   ourselves and it would cause an incredible response in our life.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Y'all give it up for Luke Lefevre.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Man, honored to be with you guys tonight.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Like Josiah said, my name is Luke.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I feel like we're just in a room of a few thousand of our closest friends.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So you can consider me a friend.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Because I want to talk to us just as a generation tonight.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Because I believe that God -- man, guys,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   do not let anybody tell you that God is not moving in our generation.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   God is moving in incredible ways across the earth right now.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And I wish I could just take you in.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I don't have time tonight.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   But I wish I could take you in to just conversations, phone calls,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   meetings that I've had in the past two weeks alone.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I am convinced that I think the next ten years are going to be ten of the
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   greatest years of global revival that the world has ever seen.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   God is moving in that type of way.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   In our generation.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I think what God did at Asbury and things he's been doing across the
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   nation, I think that was just like the cloud the size of a man's hand.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But I hear the sound, like Elijah prayed,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I hear the sound of a heavy rain coming on our generation.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   On our nation.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And God wants to use us to do -- I mean,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   think about the miracle that is in this room right now.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean there's a few thousand of us in this room.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   So many of you watching online.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And I know you're watching at the porch live locations.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   That there's this many young adults gathered together on a Tuesday night
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   in the United States hungry for God.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   That you came here because you're hungry for God.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Like that doesn't just happen.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's a miracle of the grace of God.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Like God is moving in our generation.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And I grew up with a grandfather who was a pastor.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And so I used to -- he used to live around the corner from me and I would
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   hop on my bike and ride over to my grandfather's house and he would tell
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   me stories about revival.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   He would tell me stories about moves of God throughout history.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And one of his favorite stories to tell is this move of God that took
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   place off the coast of Scotland on a small group of islands called the
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Hebrides.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And on the Hebrides islands the church was dying.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   There were no young people in the churches.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   The church was dying out.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It was basically at risk of completely disappearing.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And there were these two elderly ladies that got together.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   They were in their 70s, 80s.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And they began to cry out to God for revival on their islands.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And they cried out to God and cried out to God and cried out to God and
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   enlisting others to cry out to God for revival.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And suddenly something broke open over the islands.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And they said it was like people became -- the words they used was
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   God-conscious.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It was like heaven opened over the islands.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And there were people plowing in the fields and falling to their knees and
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   giving their lives to Christ.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And the pastor tells the stories of 300 young people at a party and the
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   presence of God hits the party.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   They run from the party to a church where services have been going until
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   11 o'clock at night.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And the pastor comes out, sees 300 young people standing outside and
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   going, hey, we don't even know why we're here.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Something drew us to this place.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Can you talk to us?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And he shares the gospel.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   They all get saved.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Story after story after story like that.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And the man who led that revival, his name was Duncan Campbell.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   He said God sets to empowering a people, he first sets to purifying a
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   people.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And he used to say this, he said the crying need of our day, this was in
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   the 1950s.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He said the crying need of our day is a baptism of holiness.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Of holy living.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And he said when that move of God was beginning to come to a close, he
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   began to understand that holiness and revival would always be
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   interconnected.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And so tonight I think there's something, if we want to see a move of
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   God in our generation, if we want to see, like, we're hungry for God to
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   move.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   There's something in our generation that's just not common.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   There's a sovereign thing that God is doing in our generation of a hunger
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   for God, of a move for God.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But if we want to see revival, we have to lay hold of a hunger for
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   holiness.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Holiness isn't about being better than the person next to us or trying
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   to do a bunch of good things.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   It's about a hunger for God himself.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   It's about a hunger for God.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   The Bible says in Hebrews pursue holiness without which no man will
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   see God.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It is a hunger to run after holiness because we want to see God.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And guys, tonight as I was praying into tonight, there were so many
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   things that I wanted to talk about.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Like, man, can I take him into some of the things that are happening
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   around the world right now.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And I want to talk about what God has done in our generation to stir
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   faith for what he wants to do.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And as I prayed for you all, I was just praying for you these past
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   weeks.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And I kept hearing the verse in Matthew 24 that says as it was in the
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   days of Noah, so will it be when the son of man comes.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be when the son of man
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   comes.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And that's in Matthew 24.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And as we get into this, I want to give us a working definition of
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   holiness.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Because I think there's a lot of confusion around what that is.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And I would say a pursuit of holiness is this.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It is actively ridding from our lives anything that might hinder
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   intimacy with Jesus.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And I want to give you a definition of holiness.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It is actively removing, cutting loose from our lives anything that
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   might hinder intimacy with God.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So if you're in Matthew 24, verse 37, we're going to start there.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And it says this, but it says...
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the son of
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   man, Jesus, be when he returns.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   It says...
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   So also will the coming of the son of man be.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Then two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   left.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Two women will be grinding at the mill, one will be taken and the
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   other left.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   house to be broken into.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   So also be ready, for the son of man is coming at an hour you do
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   not expect.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   So we need to ask the question, what was happening in the days of
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Noah?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   What was this overarching characteristic as it was in the days
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   of Noah, so will it be at the return of Christ?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   What was happening in the days of Noah?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And I think the overarching characteristic, we know that story,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   right?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I have a 1.5-year-old daughter, she has this little book about Noah
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and the story, right?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   But what was this overarching characteristic of that generation?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I would say it was widespread complacency towards the wrath of
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   God against sin.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   There was a flood coming.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And no one took it seriously.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   No one cared.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   No one paid attention.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   There is one guy building an ark and going, listen, I'm going to
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   pursue righteousness and holiness and an entire generation is going,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   God doesn't really care about the way I'm living my life.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And as I prayed for us tonight, I felt like there was a warning for
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   us as a generation that we need to lay hold of.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   That I think there is a couple people that I'm talking to in the
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   room tonight.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And I think first, there is maybe a few of you in the room, hopefully
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   there is a lot of you in the room, maybe you got invited here and
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   you don't know Christ or maybe you think you know Jesus but you
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   don't know the way to Jesus.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Maybe you randomly found your way in here and maybe a friend
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   invited you after lunch and you are here tonight and you have a
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   date with the destiny of God for your life tonight.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   That he brought you into this room because he has eternal plans
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and purposes for you.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   That he loves you and he wanted you to be here tonight to hear
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   about the only thing that can change your life and that's Jesus
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Christ.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Come on, somebody believes that.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I don't know if anyone does.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And I think there is another group of us in the room.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Maybe you surrendered your life to Christ, you have given your
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   life to Christ, you have been following Jesus but there are
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   areas of compromise and unconfessed sin in your life
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   you have been unwilling to give up.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And Jesus is calling you to repentance and to turning
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   tonight.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And so what are the things in this passage, what do we need to
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   know?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And I think the first thing is this, as it was in the days of
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Noah, so will it be when the son of man comes.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I think the first thing is this, we cannot mistake God's patience
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   with us as his passivity towards our sin.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   God is so patient with us.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   He is so kind.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He is so loving.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   He is so merciful.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   But I think there is a danger for us as a generation when we see
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   the patience and the love and the kindness of God to assume that
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   that also equals his passivity towards our sin.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   God's patience is not his passivity.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Sin isn't cute.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's not a guilty pleasure.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   It's what crucified the son of God.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Stop playing with it.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Listen, we have become playful and made pets out of the things
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   that crucified the man we claim to love.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Something doesn't add up there.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   We get entertained by and consume the things.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   We watch the shows and listen to the music and say the things that
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   put the son of God on the cross and we claim to love and follow
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   and we champion it and cheer for it.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Something doesn't add up there.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And God is calling us to change.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Listen, it says until the day Noah entered the ark, they thought
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   God had forgotten.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And I think that's the case of some of us in the room.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   We're thinking either God doesn't see what I'm doing.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   God doesn't care what I'm doing.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Or at least he doesn't care enough for me to do anything about it.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   He doesn't care enough for me to change.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But let me say this, God does not take lightly in the lives of his
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   people that which killed his son.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I have a guy that I have been discipling for the past couple of
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   years and we were having a conversation the other day.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And he's getting his degree in philosophy and he was in his
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   philosophy class the other day.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And his professor goes, hey, I want to challenge you guys.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Take your religion, whatever religion you believe.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Whatever that God says is a sin, go do it.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I dare you.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Go do it.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   See if there is any wrath.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   See if there is any judgment.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   There won't be.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And then do it again and see if anything happens.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   He goes, then you will come to know that everything you believe
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   is a lie.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   There was this famous message that was preached in the early
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   1700s by a man named Jonathan Edwards and it was attributed to
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   being one of the things that sparked one of the greatest
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   revivals in American history.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And I laugh because this message is getting a lot of bad rap
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   online.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   People keep posting about it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And anybody who is giving it a bad rap probably hasn't actually
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   read it.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   But when he preached this message, so many people started
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   getting saved.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And it was this message that was called "Sinners in the Hands of
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   an Angry God."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And has a very deceiving title.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Because it makes it feel like, oh, God is this angry person that
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   can't wait to get his hands on sinners and crush them.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   That's not what he's talking about.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Because what he's talking about is this.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   He goes, the Bible says that the wages of sin is death.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And it also says that all have sinned.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And there are so many people going around, one day I will
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   stand before God and he'll pronounce me guilty or not
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   guilty for sin.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   That's not how it works.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   He goes, the pronouncement of guilty has already gone out over
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   every man and woman who has ever lived.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And God has no obligation to keep us from separation from him.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And you know what the only thing is that is keeping us at any
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   moment from separation from God for eternity?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   The patience of a gracious God giving us time to repent and
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   turn.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   His patience in holding us.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   In going, this thing is after your destruction.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   This thing you're entertaining in your life that is coming after
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   you.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   He's going, I'm giving you time.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   But it is not -- his patience is not his passivity.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   We serve a kind, gracious, merciful, unthinkably loving
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   God.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Let me say this quickly.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   You may have had -- so much of our view of God is determined by
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   the dad that we had.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And some of you may have had an abusive, controlling father.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And that is not who God is.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   But let me say this, he's also not the passive father who lets
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   his kids do whatever they want even though it's destroying
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   them.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Like I have a 1.5-year-old daughter and the hardest thing
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   for me to do is to discipline her.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Because I'm like, man, I want you to love me.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I want you to like me.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I don't want you not to like me.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   I want to give you good things.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I want to be kind to you.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But as a dad, loving her is helping her see the things in
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   her life that are destroying her.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   That's the kind of father that God is.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   We serve a loving God.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   But I think we can also easily forget that we serve the Jesus
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   who the book of Revelation says his eyes are like flames of
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   fire.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   That a two-edged sword comes out of his mouth.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   That the prophet Isaiah when he saw God, the angels cried out,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   holy, holy, holy.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   We took my daughter to the zoo like last week.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And I was super excited to actually take her.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I know it sounds -- I was more excited about the zoo than she
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   was.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   But I was super excited because there was this new tiger exhibit
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   they built at our zoo.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   It won a ton of awards.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   Pretty cool.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   We go and I'm super excited.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Please let the tiger be there where we can see it.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   We pull up and got our daughter in the stroller.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   The tiger is sitting two feet from the glass.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's right there.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   My daughter wants to get out and see it.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We take her out and she's up on the glass, two feet from this
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   tiger.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I was super excited to get there and see it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   But when I saw the tiger, I felt sad.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I was like -- this isn't how this relationship was supposed to
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   be.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Because the zookeeper is telling us, this thing is 250 pounds of
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   pure muscle.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   500 pounds per square inch bite.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   They feed it bone because it crushes bone with its teeth and
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   can literally just swallow bone whole.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I'm sitting there and going, this isn't how this relationship
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   was supposed to be.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   This thing cooped up in an enclosure for people's
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   entertainment.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Like he's wild.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   He's dangerous.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And that's beautiful.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   And part of me looked at that tiger and thought, I want to
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   have reverence for you.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Like I want to have a reverence for you.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   That's how this relationship is supposed to work.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I shouldn't have my 1.5-year-old daughter playing around a tiger.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Like I should have come up on you in the wild.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Where there's no glass enclosure for my entertainment.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I'm coming up on you in your territory and I'm terrified and
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   in awe of the side of you.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And I give you honor and respect.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And there is -- that's what this relationship is supposed to be
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   like.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Listen, our God is described in scripture as a lion.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And many of us are trying to put him in our cute little
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   enclosure so that he's nice to look at but no longer wild.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   No longer dangerous.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   No longer has wrath towards sin.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   I think there's this danger for us in our generations.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Like we want to make Jesus into like this nice, like Middle
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Eastern Mr. Rogers.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Like that's what we're trying to do.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Look, I love Mr. Rogers.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   I think there's a ton of amazing Jesus-like qualities in Mr.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Rogers.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   But he's also the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And it's time we start treating and remembering him as such.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   There's this temptation for us to shave the mane off the lion of
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Judah and take his teeth out and put him in an enclosure we come
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   to for entertainment.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Or when we want something.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Listen, you can't tame God.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   He will not be a mess.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   He will not be put in our cute little enclosure for our
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   entertainment.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   He is sovereign.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   He is holy.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   He is the I am who I am.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And nobody approaches a lion in the wild casually.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   We have lost our reverence for God as a generation.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   We need our reverence back.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   We need our holiness back.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   We need our fear of God back.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   In the words of R.C. Sproul, a God who is only love.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Only grace.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Only mercy.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   No sovereignty.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   No justice.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   No holiness.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   No wrath.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Is an idol.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   It is something we've made in our own image to try to make God
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   like us.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I think one of my favorite descriptions of Christ actually
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   comes from C.S. Lewis' book, "The Lion, the Witch, and the
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Wardrobe."
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And that story, there's four children and they're going to meet
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   this lion named Aslan who is a depiction of Christ.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And they're going to meet him for the first time.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And one of the oldest children named Susan, she finds out for
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   the first time that he's not a man, he's actually a lion.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And she goes, wait, wait, wait.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   She goes, he's a lion?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I thought he was a man.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   And she goes, is he safe?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And their guide who is getting ready to take them to see Aslan
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   looks at her and goes, he's a lion.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Of course he's not safe.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But he's good.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   That's our God.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   He is good.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   He is loving.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   He is merciful.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   But he is not this Middle Eastern Mr. Rogers that we've tried to
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   make him into.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   He is bold and powerful as a lion.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   We cannot mistake God's patience with us as his passivity towards
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   our sin.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   But there's something I think we need to grasp here.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Because I think we can get this twisted in our minds.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And the second thing we need to know is that Jesus at the end of
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   the day, he's not as preoccupied and focused on your sin as he is
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   on your sanctification.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   We think Jesus, like we get this idea that Jesus, that the father,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   that they're just sitting up in heaven nitpicking at our sins.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   He's not.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   He's passionate about your holiness.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   He's not sitting up there going, man, one, two, there's another one.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He's going, I'm passionate about you being everything that I've
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   created you to be.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   About you living the fullness of life.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I'll get into this later.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   But in John 16, Jesus has been telling his disciples to keep his
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   commandments.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And then he gets into John 17 and says, listen, I have told you
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   these things so that my joy may be in you.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   And your joy may be full.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   See, holiness is not this straight jacket that leads to dead,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   lifeless religion.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   It is actually one of the greatest keys to life-giving joy in Jesus.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Jesus is not as focused on your sin as he is on your sanctification.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   The only reason Jesus points out our sin and is calling us out of our
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   sin is because he's trying to take us into a place of sanctification.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Now, what is sanctification?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Sanctification is growing in holiness and in Christ-likeness.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   It's learning to love what he loves, to hate what he hates, and to
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   live how he lived.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   I once heard this story, whether it's true or not, it's up for debate,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   but I think the principle is powerful.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   There was a man who claimed that one night he was asleep in bed and he
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   opened his eyes to an angel being right in front of his face.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And he opened his eyes and said there's this angel literally right in
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   his face.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And he looked in the eyes of the angel and he goes, what are you
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   looking for?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And the angel looks into his eyes and he said, God is looking to see
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   how much of his son he sees in you.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   The father isn't sitting up in heaven counting your sins going one,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   two, three, four.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   He's going, how much of my son do I see in you?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Man, and I want the answer when God looks at me, when God looks at us
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   to be a whole lot.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Like I want God to be like I see so much of my son in you.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Perfect?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   No.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Improving?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Yes.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   I want God to look at my life and go I see so much of my son in you.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   That the image of Jesus in me isn't marred and muddied and confused by
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   sin and compromise in my life.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I heard this song last week and I just haven't been able to get it out
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   of my head.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   It's a song called I'm Not My Own by Skye Peterson.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And she says in the verse, she says my body is a temple of the living
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   God.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I will worship in this house that his blood has bought.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   As I bear his image, I love this, may I not profane the holiness I hold
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   in this earthly frame.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And then she goes on in the course to say I belong to the Lord.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I am not my own.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   At the end of the day, Jesus is not as interested in your sin as he is
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   in your sanctification.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Why?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Because nothing destroys intimacy with God and effectiveness for the
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   kingdom of God faster than unconfessed, unrepentant sin.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Listen, Jesus desires your holiness because he desires your joy.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Jesus desires your holiness because he desires your joy.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   He is after our intimacy, our joy, and our effectiveness for the mission
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   and the kingdom of God.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   If you would turn quickly to 2 Timothy 2, verses 19-21.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I will go through this quickly.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It says this, it says...
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   also of wood and clay.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Some for honor and some for dishonor.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   What is he saying there?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Like when you go to like your grandma's house, I don't know if your
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   grandma is like mine but she had this fine china that was used for
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   special occasions.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   He's going there are things in a house that are used for special
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   purposes.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And he says...
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   What is Paul saying in this passage to Timothy?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   He's saying, listen, God wants to use all of us.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But have you ever wondered why does God use certain people to send
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   revival to nations?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Why does God use some people to turn cities and history upside down
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   and not use us?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Is it just a random sovereignty of God?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Paul says here it's not.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   He says he uses those who have consecrated, who have set their lives
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   apart to God.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Does God use perfect people?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   No.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Because none of those exist except for Jesus.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   But purified people, yes.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   I think John Tyson when he was commentating on this passage said it
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   best.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   He said, listen, if you're not living a consecrated life, God won't
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   love you any less.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   But he will use you less.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   The power of God flows unhindered through a holy life.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   In the words of Ian Bounds who wrote a book called "Power Through
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Prayer."
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   He wrote in the 1800s, he led a move of God not far from where I
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   live.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   One of the incredible moves of God of the past several hundred years.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And he wrote this in his book "Power Through Prayer" in the 1800s.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   He said, God doesn't need great talents nor great learning nor
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   great preachers that God needs.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Like what's -- not claiming I'm a great preacher.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I'm saying God doesn't need just more preachers.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   He doesn't need more people to talk into a microphone.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   He says what God is looking for are people great in holiness, great in
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   faith, great in love, great in fidelity, great for God.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   People always preaching by holy sermons in the pulpit and by holy
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   words.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   He said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness, great in
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   faith, great in love, great in fidelity, great in faith, great in
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   love, great in faith.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   great in faith, great in love, great in faith.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   great in faith.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And he said, God is looking for people who are great in holiness,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   great in faith.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And on either side of this road you have two ditches from the pit of
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   hell that are called legalism and lawlessness.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Now what are both of those?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Legalism says I can be as good as God.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Lawlessness says I know better than God.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   So legalism, perfect example in the scripture is the Pharisees.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   They're going, I don't need Jesus.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I can earn my way to God by keeping laws.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And everyone has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   There is nothing you can do.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Growing up and this is something in my own life that I battle with
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and I go, Lord, rid this from my heart.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   My temptation is to think God had to save me just not from that much.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   God had to save me just not from that much.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And it is like we have fallen so far.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Like we think we're not that bad because we live among a bunch of
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   other really bad people.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And I think I'm not that bad of a basketball player because I play
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   with a bunch of mediocre people.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   And if I play LeBron one-on-one, I'm a horrible basketball player.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   When we compare ourselves with the glory of God we realize how far
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   from him we are.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And legalism says I can be as good as God.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   But I think our temptation more so in our generation is to fall into
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   the ditch of lawlessness that says I know better than God.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I know better than you that this thing isn't good for my life or
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   displeases you or I shouldn't be walking in this.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   But I know better than you because I'm getting fulfillment and joy
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   out of it and I think it's going to be all right.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   I'm going to keep walking in this because I like it and I think I
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   know better than you do.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   But God is looking at the long game and this is out for your
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   destruction.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And it's the twin ditches of legalism and lawlessness.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And in Matthew 24 earlier in that chapter in verse 12 it says this,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   cold.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Love for Jesus grows cold in an atmosphere of lawlessness.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   We cannot say that we love God and yet have no desire to obey God.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Those things are incongruent with the scriptures.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   We cannot say we love God and have no desire to obey God.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   What is lawlessness?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   It's contempt for or violation of or disregard for the commands of
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   God.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And lawlessness in the end, you might be able to entertain a
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   little bit of it now.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Like you may be able to have a little bit of fire and a little
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   bit of lawlessness in your life but in the end that thing is going
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   to kill.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   It will smother the flame of fire and passion for Jesus in your
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   life.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It will take it out.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And lawlessness is a fake liberty.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   It is counterfeit freedom.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   See, liberty and freedom in Jesus, this loving obedience to
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Jesus, liberty in Jesus is not the freedom to sin however we
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   want, do whatever we want and still be covered by the grace of
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   God.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Liberty is the freedom to choose to obey God.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Not simply out of obligation but because we love him.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It's liberty because it's no longer forced but rather out of
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   freedom.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   In John 14, 15, Jesus is speaking to his disciples, if you love
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   me, you will keep my commandments.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   The evidence of love for God is a desire to keep his commands.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   He says again in John 14, 21, he who has my commands and keeps
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   them, it's he who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   my father and I will love him and manifest myself to him.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I will reveal myself to him.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   He says in 15.10, if you keep my commandments, you will abide
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   and live in my love.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Guys, I think if some of the people in our generation, like
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   if some of us were around at the time Jesus was preaching that
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   message in John 14 and 15, I think some of us would be going
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   up to him after service and hey, Jesus, can I talk to you for a
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   second.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Great message.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   It was good.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   It was pretty good.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   But I don't know if you know this.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I do.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   That's why I am telling you.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Is all of that like obedience to command stuff, it's kind of
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   legalistic.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Like I don't know if you know that.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   But it's kind of leaning towards legalism.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   But he's going no, no, no.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   He goes, I have told you these things so that my joy may be in
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   you and your joy may be fullest.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And I think our generation if we were back in the days of King
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Josiah and the Old Testament, maybe some of us would have said
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   the same thing.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Where Josiah becomes king at 8 years old.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   His dad is an idiot and leads the entire nation of Israel into
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   sin and corruption and is tearing the nation apart.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Josiah becomes king at 8 years old.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And when he's a teenager, they uncover the word of God that his
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   dad had buried under a bunch of junk in the temple for decades.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Like it had disappeared.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And he gets a hold of it.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   He reads it like in one sitting.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Reads the Old Testament essentially.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Not all of it because not all had been written by the point he
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   was alive.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   But he reads the scriptures for the first time and sees how far
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   they are from how God called them to live.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And he starts going from north to south in the kingdom of
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Israel and tearing down every single idol in all of Israel.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And some of you are going, Josiah, calm down bro.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Every idol.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Every one.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Listen, okay, you can have the big ones.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Take the big ones.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   Those are great.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Like take those.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   But let us keep our household gods.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Let's just keep the little ones.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Okay, not the household gods.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Let us at least keep the high places.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And the high places in Israel weren't even necessarily places
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   of worship to false gods.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   They were attempts to worship God how people wanted to worship
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   God.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   They were altars to Yahweh built in a way that was not prescribed
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   by the word of God.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   That they are going, I'm going to worship God and do it how I
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   want.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And no king in Israel's history had ever torn them down.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   They had torn down the other idols and taken the household
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   idols down.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   But they had never taken the high places down.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   And Josiah goes, no.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   No compromise.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Not in my day.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   And listen, I think there are some of us, I think we are in
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   danger of a generation of not even realizing how far we are
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   from God because we haven't been in the book enough to know.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Like Josiah uncovers the word of God that's been hidden for
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   generations and he weeps and he's like, where was this?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Nobody told me this.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   Nobody told me that God wanted to bless our nation.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   That he wanted to live among his people.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   That he wanted to dwell in our midst.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   That the manifest presence of God could be in our nation and
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   in our lives.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   And we could be a beacon of hope to the world.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   And this is what he tells us to live.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And we have completely squandered it and we have
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   completely neglected God.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   And look, if we will get into the word of God, it will expose
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   the idols in our lives.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   I think God is looking for a generation that is going no
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   compromise.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   We want God.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Listen, sacrificial obedience isn't legalism.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   It is evidence that there's nothing in your life that you
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   love as much as nearness to God.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   You know, one of the other things that we learned when we
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   were at that tiger exhibit, obviously you can tell I really
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   liked the tiger exhibit.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   My wife actually pointed this out so I'm going to pretend like
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I came up with this.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   One of the other things we learned at the tiger exhibit,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   they have three tigers at this one exhibit.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   But they will only put one in the enclosure at a time.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   And so some people were asking the zookeeper who was standing
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   there explaining, why do you only put one at a time?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Will they fight?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   He goes, no, no, they won't fight.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And at that point he starts to explain to us the territorial
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   nature of big cats.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Like tigers and lions.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   He goes, they won't fight.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   He goes, you would just never see them.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   He goes, because one would go to one corner of the enclosure and
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   one would go to the other corner of the enclosure.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Why?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Because big cats don't share territory.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   The lion of Judah is not content to share the territory of our
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   hearts with idols and unrepentant sin.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   He won't do it.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   He'll go, you want to live that way?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   It will smother your love and our intimacy.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   He's not going to share the territory of our hearts with
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   idols.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Sacrificial obedience is not legalism.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   It is evidence of true love for Jesus.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And I want to say this lastly.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   We're talking about in the days of Noah, as it was in the days of
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Noah, so will it be when the son of man comes.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I was meditating on that passage as I was preparing for tonight
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   and just thinking about that, I'm going, really, Lord, like one
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   righteous man?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   One righteous man and his family were saved out of all of those
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   people, really God?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And I just felt him just remind me.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Yes, Luke, only one blameless man, as it said of Noah.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   But Noah was a picture of the only one righteous, sinless man
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   who would come to save the world of sin.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   And now his family.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   See, Jesus is the ark that we run into in the flood of the
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   wrath of God.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   And we say, Jesus, save us.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   It is a prophetic picture of going there is displeasure of
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   God against sin.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And we run in and go, Jesus, only you can cleanse me.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Only you can change me.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   I love what Charles Spurgeon said, you want to live a holy
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   life, live near to Jesus.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Like we can't live in holiness in our own strength.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   It is nearness to Jesus, the Holy Spirit empowering us to
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   live how he has called us to live.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Jesus is the ark that we run into in the midst of the flood.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Listen, God's work on the cross through Jesus didn't simply
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   erase the wrath of God against sin.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I think we can think that, Jesus came and now poof, God no
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   more.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   That's not what happened.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   What Jesus did on the cross didn't erase God's wrath against
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   sin more than Noah building an ark erased the flood from
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   coming.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   What Jesus did on the cross rescued us from God's wrath
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   against sin.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   But I think there's this danger for us.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   That I see in our generation, we don't see Noah when the flood
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   comes and ark is built and lifted up on the flood water and
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   getting on the deck and wonder how close I can get to the
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   railing without falling into the flood.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   I wonder how close I can get.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   And the rain starts to stop a little bit and flood water
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   coming from the springs of the deep as the word says was
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   happening.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   And the water starts to calm a little bit.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I will take a quick dip in the flood.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I will take a swim in the water.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   How close to the line can I get without falling into God's
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   displeasure?
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   And I think God is looking for a generation that's not going
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   how close to the line can I get without sinning.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   He's looking for a generation that's asking how close to God
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   can I get without holding anything back from him.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Jesus isn't looking for a generation that's asking how
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   close to God can I get without sinning.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   He's looking for a generation that's going this is a gray
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   area so I will dive into it.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   We're not looking at gray areas and going it's gray so the
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Bible isn't clear so I will run for it.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I will jump into it.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   We're not asking is it sin.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   We're asking does this thing actively draw me to Jesus?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Does this actively draw me closer to God?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Does this look like the pursuit of righteousness?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   The pursuit of holiness?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And tonight I think there's a couple responses for us.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And if you want to go ahead and stand to your feet.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I think there's a couple responses for us tonight.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   And like I said at the beginning, I think there's some
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   people that are asking what is it that you do in here?
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   That you don't know Jesus.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Maybe you grew up in church.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Maybe you thought you knew what it meant to follow Jesus.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Maybe Christian was just a label you used because you grew up in
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   a Christian home.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   But you never heard that the wages of sin is death.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   That all have sinned.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   That what we are rightfully owed for the choices we have made to
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   rebel against God is separation from God for eternity.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   And it's the good news that God became a man in Jesus Christ.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   That he lived the life that we couldn't live.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   That we've tried to live.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   But we couldn't.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   That we've all sinned.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And then he died the death that we deserve for our sin in our
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   place.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   And not only did he die the death we deserve.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   But three days later he rose from the dead proving he was who he
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   claimed to be.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   The son of God.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   And now he offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness of
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   sins to all who will repent and believe in him.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   And there are some of you here tonight who you need to make the
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   decision to say I'm going all in.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I see that there is the wrath of God against sin.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   The flood coming.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   And I will not live in indifference towards it.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   I see the ark.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Listen, if you were living in the days of Noah and you could see
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   the raindrops falling and the ark door was still open,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   wouldn't you run?
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Wouldn't you run to go save me?
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I don't care what the stipulations are.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   I don't care what the qualifications need to be.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   And good news, the qualification is just this, Jesus, I have no
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   qualifications.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I need you.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   And I surrender everything in my life to you.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Wouldn't you run?
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   That's some of us in the room tonight.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   And then there's some of us in the room tonight that I think we
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   need to pray as the psalmist prayed in Psalm 139.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   God, search me and know me.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   And see if there's any wicked way or unpleasing way in me to
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   you.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   And lead me in the way everlasting.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   God, is there anything that is hindering closeness with you?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Like you've just been coming off of launch, talking about the
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   love of God, the desire that he has to be near to his people to
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   live with you, to love you, to transform you.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   And the pursuit of holiness isn't about going, well, I got to
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   clean myself up to come to God.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   It's going, God, help me.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   I need you.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Lord, I want to live close to you.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Would you shine a spotlight on any area that's compromising that
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   in my life.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Like listen, even recently I've been praying, Lord, is there
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   anything in my life.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   And I felt like he was highlighting a TV show that we
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   watched and it was like super clean.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Except for a few pieces of this one part of it.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I felt like, Lord, listen, like nothing in your life that could
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   compromise intimacy with me.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   How many of y'all have heard the verse draw near to God and God
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   will draw near to you?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   Have you heard that before?
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Did you know that that verse is actually in the context of
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   repentance?
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   We think, draw near to God in worship.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Draw near to God in the word.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Draw near to God in prayer.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   But actually it says in James chapter 4, it says, cleanse your
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   hands, clean your hands.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Purify your hearts, you double-minded.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Weep and mourn.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Draw near to God and God will draw near to you.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   You want to know what the key to drawing near to God is?
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   It's repentance.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   It's going, God, I turn from anything that hinders intimacy
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   with you according to your word.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And I am running into full surrender to you.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   And so we're going to take a moment to respond to that in
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   just a second.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   One thing I wanted to do tonight is I know we've been talking
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   about holiness and there's so many practical pieces, so much
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   misconception around holiness in our generation.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   So I recently wrote a book on this, it's actually super short.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   It's like 70 pages.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   I made it short on purpose.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   JP, Jonathan McCloud, wrote the main endorsement for it.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   But I wanted to give it to y'all.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   You guys can download it for free.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Actually if you scan this QR code, you can download it for
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   free.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   I just encourage you to read that.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   Here are the keys that God is calling us to walk into.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   And the subtitle of this book is rediscovering the joy of
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   holiness.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   That God desires our holiness because he desires our joy.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   So if you're looking for some practical next steps, that's a
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   great place to start.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   I want to go ahead with every head bowed, every eye closed.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   If you are here tonight and you feel the Holy Spirit drawing you
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   to Jesus, you're going, man, I didn't know that my sin had
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   separated me from God.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   I thought Jesus was just like this guru guy, this nice guy to
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   kind of powder my life after.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I didn't know that he was saving me from the righteous judgment
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   of God against sin.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   And you're going, tonight is my night.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   I am surrendering everything to Jesus.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   I'm putting my faith in Jesus.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   I am turning from the way I've been walking.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   I'm giving everything to Jesus.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   Just on the count of three, I want you to raise your hand and
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   look up at me.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   If that's you and you feel your heart beating out of your chest,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   I want you to look up at the Holy Spirit saying, that's you.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   One, two, three.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Come on, praise God.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Praise God, come on.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   Praise God, praise God.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Come on, thank you, Jesus.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Come on, praise God.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   If you're at the porch live location, same thing.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Just put up your hand, just this physical response going, I'm
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   surrendering everything to Jesus.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Praise God.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   And then with every head bowed, every eye closed, if there is --
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   if there are those of us in the room, we're praying, God, search
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   me, know me.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   See if there is any wicked way in me.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Lead me in your way.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   If there's anything unpleasing to you, shine a spotlight in my
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   heart, Holy Spirit, because I want to be near to you.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   I want to draw near to you.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   I'm not going to call for response, but what I'm going to
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   do is we go back into worship.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   If that's you, there's going to be a ministry team down here.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   If there are things you need to confess your sin, the Bible says
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   to confess your sins to one another.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Listen, I have been walking in this.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   This is the key to your freedom of confessing openly what you
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   have been walking and going.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   I'm going to go to a leader, I'm going to go to one of the porch
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   team members, I'm going to go, hey, this is something I have
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   been struggling with, I'm walking in this, I'm confessing
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   this, I'm turning from this, would you pray with me.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   I would encourage you to come down, find a team member, pray
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   with them.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And the Bible says that if we confess our sins, he is
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   faithful and he is just to forgive us our sins and to
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   cleanse us.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   Guys, there is nothing like the feeling of the fresh cleansing
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   and washing of the Holy Spirit.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   When we come and we confess sin to God, he doesn't go, been
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   waiting for you to tell me that, should have done that a long
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   time ago.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   He says, man, I have been waiting to wash you.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   All that guilt you have been feeling, all that confusion
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   you have been feeling, all that grasping for something that
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   you thought was going to satisfy you but didn't, I have been
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   waiting to cleanse you.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   I have been waiting to wash you clean.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Let Jesus do that for you tonight.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   And if you gave your life to Christ for the first time, I
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   would encourage you to come down and pray with the porch
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   and we will do this quickly.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   If you gave your life to Christ for the first time, we will
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   pray this together.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   This prayer does not save you.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Putting your faith in Jesus does.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   What this prayer is, is helping to give you words to say I am
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   giving my all to Jesus.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I encourage us to pray this together.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Let's pray this.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Lord Jesus, I know that I have sinned.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   That I have fallen short of your glory.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   I know that I need you.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I know that I have been separated from you by my sin.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   And I ask that you would come into my life.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   And change me from the inside out.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   I give you every part of my life.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   The big parts.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   The small parts.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   And everything in between.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   And I commit to seek you with my whole heart.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   From this day forward.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   In Jesus' name I pray.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Amen.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   [Music playing]
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.580]   (gentle music)
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.640]   you
