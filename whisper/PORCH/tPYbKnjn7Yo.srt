1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,160
 He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,840
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,120
 are with me.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,180
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,840
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,960
 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,160
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,320
 in the house of the Lord forever.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
 What's up Porch, how we doing tonight?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,840
 Hey it is so good to see you.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,080
 If this is your first time here, my name is Timothy Attik, I'm one of the teaching pastors

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,160
 here at Watermark on Sundays and here at the Porch.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,080
 I want to say hello to all the Porch Live locations that are watching tonight and obviously

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,500
 hello to everyone in the room here in Dallas.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,080
 We are in the second week of our series where we are walking through what is quite possibly

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,280
 the most famous chapter in the entire Bible, it's Psalm 23.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,680
 Even if you're new to the Bible, not very familiar with Christianity, there is a very

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,920
 good chance that you're familiar with the text that was just read on that video that

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
 we watched.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,040
 It's most often read at funerals, but it is the most familiar and most famous chapter

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
 in the entire Bible.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,180
 And we are journeying just one or two verses at a time over a five-week period.

25
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,960
 So welcome, and I'm so glad that you're jumping in with us.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
 I'll start by sharing this with you.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,000
 I totally got sucked into an ad on Instagram just a couple weeks ago, I'm going to tell

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,760
 you about it.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,040
 My phone is playing music right now, I better stop that because now's not a time for that

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,040
 to happen, but it's great.

31
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,240
 I was like, "What is that and why doesn't someone answer the phone?"

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,360
 That's my phone playing music.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
 Perfect.

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
 Where was I?

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,280
 Instagram, getting sucked into it.

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,080
 So here's the deal, y'all don't have spring break anymore because you're in the real world,

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,160
 but my kids still have spring break, which means I still get spring break, which is awesome.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,120
 Well the few weeks leading up to spring break, I went on a diet which put me into a calorie

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,840
 deficit, which is really tough for someone who loves food.

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,720
 I hated my life for like three weeks and then spring break hit, and man, I just went off

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,200
 the cliff of eating food.

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,040
 Like I ate like the world was coming to an end.

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,860
 And because of that, and because of the reality that our phones are always listening to us,

44
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,480
 my phone heard that I was talking about diets and because I was eating like the world was

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
 going to end, I think I was talking about working out.

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,920
 And so when I got back from spring break, there were these ads that were popping up

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,440
 on Instagram about diet plans or workout plans.

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,480
 And one day I was taking a nap and I woke up from my nap and I guess I was feeling just

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,880
 vulnerable because I got on Instagram and there was this ad of this guy without his

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,440
 shirt on showing his six pack, eating a piece of pizza saying, "You don't ever have to do

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,520
 cardio again in your life and you can eat pizza."

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,160
 And I was like, "Tell me more."

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
 And so it was like, "Click here."

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,800
 I was like, "I'll click there."

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,860
 And then I proceeded to watch a video for 28 minutes of this guy showing me how I can

56
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,680
 eat pizza with a six pack.

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,400
 And then that video led me to a page where I gave him all my credit card information.

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,640
 And then after I pushed send or submit, it took me to another video that I then watched

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,920
 where it gave me another opportunity to sign up for more things that would help me eat

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,800
 pizza with a six pack.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,640
 And now I have deep regret because here's the deal.

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,880
 When you pay money to one Instagram ad, Instagram's like, "We've got him.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,240
 This is a guy that likes to spend money on stuff he'll never use.

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,960
 So let's flood his feed with ads."

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,080
 But here's the reality.

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,720
 Here's where I'm at with that workout plan.

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,440
 I fully understand what that guy wants to do for me.

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,520
 He wants to send me multiple emails every single day.

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,620
 He wants to get into a Zoom chat with me where he can tell me what to eat and what to do

70
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
 for a workout.

71
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,780
 I know exactly what he wants to do for me and I know what possibilities await.

72
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,080
 And yet I've paid the $61 two weeks ago and I haven't done a thing with it.

73
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,640
 So I know what this guy wants to do.

74
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,520
 I know the possibilities that await, but the reality is that action is required on my part.

75
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,960
 And the reason I share that with you is because as we step back into Psalm 23, tonight you're

76
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,760
 going to walk away very clear on what God wants to do for you.

77
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 And you're going to be clear on what possibilities await for you, but it's going to require action

78
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
 on your part.

79
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,860
 It's going to require you to take a step.

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,600
 Some of you are here tonight and you're like, I know exactly what God wants to do for me.

81
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,840
 I know exactly what the possibilities are and I know what action I need to take and

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
 I'm taking it.

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
 And you've been walking with Jesus Christ.

84
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,140
 You're on fire for Jesus Christ.

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,560
 This is the best season of life that you've had with Jesus to date.

86
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,980
 And if that's you, I'm so glad you're here.

87
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
 Keep going.

88
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,240
 Others of you, you've been a believer for a long time and you know what God wants to

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
 do for you.

90
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,440
 You know the possibilities await that await with Jesus.

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,600
 And yet you're in a season of life post-college where you've just kind of fallen off.

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,140
 And college was like your spiritual glory days.

93
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,380
 Like you sometimes in your mind play the highlight reel of your spiritual life in college and

94
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,200
 something deep down inside of you is like, if I could just go back there, if I could

95
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,800
 just get back to that place where I had that community and I was involved in these different

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,720
 organizations and that was five years ago for some of you.

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,120
 And for five years, you've just kind of been in limbo.

98
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,560
 And then for others of you, you got tricked into coming tonight.

99
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,560
 Someone was like, let's get a happy hour.

100
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,640
 And they brought you here.

101
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,200
 This is a happy hour.

102
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,800
 Like we will be happy for about an hour.

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,520
 So they didn't lie to you.

104
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,000
 But you walked in here and you're not very familiar with Jesus.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,860
 You're not very familiar with Christianity.

106
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,360
 You know more about what Christians stand against and what it's for.

107
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,120
 And so man, I'm so glad you're here as well because you're going to hear what God wants

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,200
 to do for you and what is possible, but it will require action on your part.

109
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,120
 So if you have a Bible, I want you to join me tonight in Psalm 23.

110
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,220
 Psalm 23 is where we're going to be.

111
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,720
 Since we're going to be rooted in one passage that only has six verses for five weeks, I

112
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,800
 just want to encourage you to put it to memory.

113
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,040
 Like I guarantee you this chapter really can change your life, can change your life.

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,960
 Tonight we're looking at verses two and three, but I'll start in verse one because we covered

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
 it last week.

116
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,480
 If you weren't here for the launch of the series, I would encourage you to go back and

117
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
 check it out.

118
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:16,280
 But King David is writing and David is using the imagery of a shepherd.

119
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
 Why?

120
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,680
 Well, because David's dad was a shepherd and David himself was a shepherd.

121
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,160
 And when David became the King of Israel, kings in the ancient near East were referred

122
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,640
 to as shepherd kings.

123
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,120
 So this is like a football coach using a football analogy.

124
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,080
 It just makes sense.

125
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,120
 David who has been a shepherd and is the shepherd of a nation is saying even this shepherd needs

126
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
 a shepherd.

127
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
 And so he starts in verse one.

128
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
 And what does he say?

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,200
 The Lord is my shepherd.

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,240
 I shall not want or I lack nothing or I have all that I need.

131
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
 And now he goes on to verses two and three.

132
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
 Listen to what he says.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,000
 He says, he makes me lie down in green pastures.

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
 He leads me besides still waters.

135
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,320
 He restores my soul.

136
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,840
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

137
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,360
 Do you see the activity in these two verses?

138
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,920
 If you follow the verbs, all of the verbs are attached to God.

139
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,440
 So these two verses are all about what God is doing.

140
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
 It's all about his activity.

141
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,040
 It's about what he wants to do in your life.

142
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
 And because we're going to see what God wants to do in your life, you're going to see the

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,280
 possibilities that await for you.

144
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,920
 But if you look at what God does, it says that verse two, he makes me lie down in green

145
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
 pastures.

146
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
 He leads besides still waters.

147
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,200
 He restores my soul.

148
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,900
 He leads me in paths of righteousness.

149
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,280
 This is the activity of God, our shepherd.

150
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,880
 And so what you're going to see tonight is what God delights doing in his sheep.

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
 It's what he wants to do in your life.

152
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,320
 So this is my invitation to you to just become familiar with what God wants to do.

153
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,120
 There's four things I'm going to identify from this passage that God wants to do in

154
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,960
 your life.

155
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,480
 The first thing that God wants to do is God wants to satisfy you.

156
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
 God wants to satisfy you.

157
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,560
 When I talk about satisfaction, I'm talking about satisfying the deepest longings of your

158
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
 soul.

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
 Well, where do I get that from?

160
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,800
 I get that from verse two.

161
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,240
 David says, he makes me lie down in green pastures.

162
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,080
 He leads me besides still waters.

163
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,040
 There's two different ideas here that we need to identify.

164
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,840
 One is the idea of nourishment because he identifies green pastures, which was what

165
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,060
 sheep would eat for food and then quiet waters, which is where sheep would drink.

166
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,360
 So he's talking about nourishment, but he's not just talking about nourishment.

167
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,680
 He's also talking about rest.

168
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
 He says, he makes me lie down in green pastures.

169
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,840
 Obviously, for a sheep to be made to lie down, that sheep is being put into a position of

170
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,240
 rest.

171
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,480
 But he says, he leads me beside quiet waters.

172
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,080
 Some of your Bibles have an asterisk next to quiet waters.

173
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:26,180
 And if you were to look at the bottom, the Hebrew there can also be translated waters

174
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,240
 of rest.

175
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,760
 So there's two ideas here, nourishment and rest.

176
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,080
 And what is helpful here is to hear from an actual shepherd.

177
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,580
 There's a guy named Philip Keller who was a shepherd in Africa.

178
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,440
 And then he became a lay minister, lay pastor.

179
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,200
 And he wrote a book called A Shepherd's Look at Psalm 23, where he just looks at what David

180
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,560
 is saying and he provides insight from the viewpoint of a shepherd.

181
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,460
 And here's what he identifies.

182
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,800
 He identifies the fact that it's very hard to make a sheep lie down to rest when they're

183
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,540
 hungry.

184
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,280
 Some of y'all can totally identify with that.

185
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,000
 Like when you get hungry/hangry, you can't think straight, you can't sit still.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,360
 And what Philip Keller is saying is, "Hey, when a sheep is hungry, like that sheep is

187
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,720
 going to wander around in what is often an arid climate looking for green pasture to

188
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,360
 feed on.

189
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,600
 Because until he's full, he's not going to lie down to rest."

190
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,440
 But then he also identifies the fact that if a sheep is thirsty, that sheep will begin

191
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
 to wander looking for water.

192
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,840
 And if the sheep is not led to the right places, they will drink from polluted potholes where

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,920
 they pick up parasites that can make them sick.

194
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,440
 So just take that idea.

195
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,340
 David is talking about nourishment and rest.

196
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,640
 And Philip Keller is saying a sheep will not lie down if they're hungry.

197
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,960
 So here's what that tells us.

198
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:13,680
 It tells us that satisfaction is key to rest.

199
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,420
 Like when you are hungry, you will be restless.

200
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,200
 And so here's where I'm getting at.

201
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,520
 Let me just ask you this.

202
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:31,400
 Is your life rest-filled or is it rest-less?

203
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,760
 Here's what I'm really asking you.

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,160
 I'm not asking you if you're getting enough sleep at night.

205
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,520
 What I'm asking you about is your inner peace.

206
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,800
 Like would you describe your life as peaceful?

207
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,280
 Do you feel peace in your soul?

208
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,600
 I would imagine that a good majority of you would say no.

209
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:04,160
 I mean, studies have shown that millennials in Gen Z are the most anxious generations

210
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,860
 to date, which just means that we are restless people.

211
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,720
 We are people who struggle to tap into peace.

212
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,800
 Do you know why that is?

213
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,280
 Do you know why you might be restless?

214
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,920
 The reason that you might be restless is because you're hungry.

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,720
 And so the question is, what is your soul craving right now?

216
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,280
 It's just good for you to evaluate because what we have is we have David saying, "Let

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,880
 me tell you what my shepherd, my God, does.

218
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,960
 My shepherd makes me lie down in green pastures.

219
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,000
 He leads me beside quiet waters."

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,600
 So this is David saying, "My shepherd has satisfied the deepest longings of my soul

221
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,320
 and because he has, I rest.

222
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,380
 I'm at peace."

223
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,920
 If you lack peace, if you feel restless, it's because you're hungry.

224
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,040
 So what you need to figure out is what is your soul craving right now?

225
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,160
 What do you believe is the key to your peace?

226
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,800
 I would imagine that for many of you, the thing that your soul is craving right now

227
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,200
 is purpose and significance.

228
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,780
 You're in your first or second job out of college and part of you is just so antsy because

229
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,840
 you still don't feel like you're doing what you were made to do.

230
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,720
 So you just feel like you're filling a job and it's not really satisfying.

231
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,840
 So you don't feel like your life is filled with purpose or maybe you really like your

232
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,440
 job but you desperately want the respect of the people that are above you.

233
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,200
 You're trying to make a name for yourself.

234
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,400
 You want to show the world that you have become something and you are living an honorable,

235
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,840
 respectable life of significance.

236
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,160
 And so you're restless.

237
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,120
 Or maybe you're hungry just for experiences.

238
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,640
 Like you're in your early, mid or late twenties and you're like, okay, this is the one time

239
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,320
 of my life, like before I settle down, before I get married, before I have kids, like this

240
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,880
 is the time I just want to squeeze every aspect out of it.

241
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,960
 Like if there's an experience to be had, like this is the least constrained I am in my life.

242
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,800
 So I want to be out with friends on Saturdays.

243
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,640
 Like I want to wake up, I want to get out of the house early, I want to work out, I

244
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,440
 want to get out, I want to be with friends.

245
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,480
 If something is happening, you fear missing out.

246
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,520
 You're just hungry for that connection.

247
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,800
 Others of you, you're craving companionship or love.

248
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,700
 You want to find your people in Dallas.

249
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,440
 You're tired of spending night after night by yourself in your apartment.

250
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,880
 Others of you, you just want to know the affection of a guy or a girl.

251
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,240
 Like you're tired of being on the wedding circuit.

252
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,960
 When is your wedding going to be on the circuit?

253
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,500
 And so you're just craving that companionship, love.

254
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,320
 Some of y'all are craving security.

255
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:21,440
 Like you're carrying a lot of debt from college right now and it feels like forever before

256
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,400
 you'll be out of it.

257
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,480
 And so you just feel so constrained financially and you just want that security, that peace

258
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,760
 of mind that that weight has been lifted.

259
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,920
 So you're restless.

260
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,960
 And then others of you, you're just craving comfort and ease because life has been hard.

261
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,960
 And you're just tired of life being difficult and you're just craving like a moment of just

262
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,080
 ease, like a season where the waves stop.

263
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,520
 Just identify real quick, what are you craving?

264
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,640
 Identify it, name it, name it in your mind and your heart.

265
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 What are you craving?

266
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,080
 Now answer this question, what or how are you trying to satisfy your craving?

267
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,360
 How are you trying to satisfy it and is it working?

268
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,080
 Because some of you might realize that you are subconsciously or you're just not even

269
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,200
 thinking about it, but you're trying to satisfy your cravings in ways that are actually intensifying

270
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 your cravings.

271
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,920
 So for example, when I was in college, one of the ways that I tried to satisfy my craving

272
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,800
 for significance in love was that I looked at pornography.

273
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 Like I had a seven year run looking to pornography because in a fantasy world, I was extremely

274
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:49,480
 significant and I experienced some distorted version of intimacy, which was really no intimacy

275
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,960
 at all.

276
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,480
 But when I would finish looking at porn, there was shame.

277
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,920
 And then there was just the reminder that it was all just a distorted version of intimacy,

278
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,360
 which was no intimacy at all.

279
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,600
 It just, it intensified the craving.

280
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,280
 Or like for example, I mean, I shared last week that 2022 was probably the hardest year

281
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
 of my life.

282
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,160
 And you know what I craved?

283
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,880
 I craved comfort and ease.

284
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,080
 So there were, there was some times where I would, I would just sit down on the couch

285
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:32,880
 at night, turn on Netflix and get a bowl of popcorn to, to try and have some mirage of

286
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
 ease.

287
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:44,080
 But when the show was over or the bowl was empty, all I had done was escaped for 45 minutes.

288
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,600
 The waves of life were still crashing in.

289
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,520
 Instead of dealing with the waves, I was trying to escape them.

290
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,680
 And then honestly, social media, like it can be a good thing.

291
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,920
 It also can be a bad thing.

292
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,440
 Like there have been times in my life where I've just had to shut it off because you know

293
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,480
 what it does is it intensifies a craving for being significant that is super unhealthy

294
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
 in my life.

295
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,320
 So you just have to ask, like when you're looking at social media, if you're looking

296
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,000
 at what everyone else is doing and it causes you to compare, does it just intensify your

297
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 craving?

298
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,880
 Identify what are you hungry for and how are you trying to, to, to deal with that hunger?

299
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,080
 My fear is that many of us would deal with it like the nation of Israel did.

300
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,280
 Jeremiah 2.13, God says, "My people have committed two sins.

301
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,480
 They've forsaken me, the spring of living water, and they've dug their own cisterns,

302
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,040
 broken cisterns that cannot hold water."

303
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,240
 Do you hear what God's saying?

304
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,800
 He's saying, "Look, you, you've forsaken me.

305
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,760
 Like I'm the one who gives you living water.

306
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,160
 I'm the one that can satisfy your thirst, but instead you've, you've made broken cisterns

307
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,480
 that can hold no water."

308
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
 So what you have to figure out is if you're thirsty and yet you're trying to drink from

309
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,880
 cups that in the end it, it will not satisfy.

310
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,360
 It's, it's broken.

311
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 It's, it's busted pornography.

312
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,560
 It cannot satisfy you.

313
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,560
 Hooking up with guy after guy or girl after girl, in the end, it cannot satisfy you.

314
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:29,600
 Going out night after night, drink after drink, in the end, you might escape something, but

315
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,440
 you will not satisfy something.

316
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,480
 And so I just want to tell you that I think David who wrote Psalm 23, I think he was onto

317
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,960
 something because we're talking about what are you hungry for?

318
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,360
 What are you craving?

319
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,400
 Listen to what David says in Psalm 34.

320
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,440
 Listen to his mentality.

321
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,960
 Psalm 34 verse eight, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good."

322
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,160
 Psalm 36, seven through nine, David says, "How precious is your steadfast love, O God.

323
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,920
 The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings."

324
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,000
 Watch this.

325
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,680
 Verse eight, watch the language.

326
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,440
 "They feast on the abundance of your house.

327
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,480
 You give them drink from the river of your delights, for with you is the fountain of

328
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
 life.

329
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,200
 In your light do we see light."

330
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,800
 Jesus says in John 6, 35, he says, "I am the bread of life.

331
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,320
 Whoever comes to me shall not hunger and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."

332
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,840
 And then in Matthew 11, 28, Jesus says, "Come to me.

333
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,440
 Come to me.

334
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:53,880
 All who are weary, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you," what?

335
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,960
 "Rest."

336
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,800
 Augustine said this.

337
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:09,680
 He said, "O God, thou hast made us for thyself and our souls are restless, searching till

338
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,680
 they find their rest in thee."

339
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,880
 And so I'm just telling you, if you want to know what God wants to do for you, first,

340
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,080
 the first thing he wants to do is he wants to satisfy you.

341
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,600
 He wants to make you lie down in green pastures.

342
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,640
 He wants to lead you beside quiet waters.

343
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,040
 He wants to satisfy the hungers, the cravings of your soul so that you will experience rest.

344
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:38,240
 I am just telling you, everything you are longing for is found in the person of Jesus

345
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
 Christ.

346
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,480
 And you won't be able to understand that until you take a step of faith to try and

347
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,680
 experience it.

348
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,960
 Like until you make a decision where you just say, "Look, if there is a longing in me, I

349
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,600
 am going to take a step of faith and believe that only Jesus Christ can satisfy the deepest

350
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,280
 longings of my soul.

351
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,960
 And so I'm going to press into Jesus.

352
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,720
 I'm going to wake up and meet with Jesus.

353
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,760
 I'm going to gather with friends and talk about Jesus."

354
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,480
 Here's a discussion for you and your friends to have tonight.

355
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,800
 I want to encourage you to sit with your friends and just discuss this.

356
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:25,080
 How can Jesus satisfy the hungers of your soul, which will require you to be honest

357
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,760
 and say, "This is what I'm craving in my soul."

358
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,120
 How can Jesus satisfy it?

359
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,000
 The second thing God wants to do in your life is God wants to restore you.

360
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,900
 He wants to restore you in verse 3.

361
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,840
 David simply says, "He restores my soul."

362
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,520
 There's two images that play into the idea of God restoring.

363
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,280
 When David says, "He restores my soul," the first image is the idea of a sheep wandering

364
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,800
 away and the shepherd going and chasing the sheep down and bringing the sheep back.

365
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,080
 It's the idea of repentance where the sheep that has wandered gets brought back.

366
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:12,960
 The second idea is just the idea of a shepherd nursing the sheep back to health.

367
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,800
 So if you want to zone out tomorrow at work, just get on YouTube.

368
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,880
 I'm not encouraging it.

369
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,080
 I'm just saying, some of you all, you're going to do it no matter what.

370
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,160
 So I'm just telling you what to watch.

371
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:32,720
 You just go type in, type in "cast sheep," C-A-S-T, cast sheep.

372
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,680
 There's a real thing where a cast sheep is a sheep that decided to lay down to relax.

373
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:47,280
 And when he laid down, you know, sheep's bodies are very wide and their backs are extremely

374
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,720
 flat.

375
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,560
 So when a sheep lays down, if he begins to kick his legs, that sheep, without realizing

376
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:04,280
 it, will roll over on its back and get stuck because its back is like a table.

377
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:10,060
 And so you will see videos of sheep just sitting there like flailing about and they can't do

378
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
 anything about it.

379
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:16,720
 And it's actually a huge problem because if they lay there for just a few hours, then

380
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:24,200
 gases can build up in their bodies and they can die within hours just from laying down.

381
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,840
 So I'm really like, I get that.

382
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,600
 And so the idea is a shepherd comes and, I mean, you can watch shepherds.

383
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,640
 They'll come and flip the sheep over and like all of the blood is out of their legs.

384
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,500
 So they're just like, they've got dead legs and then they get up and they run on.

385
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,880
 But it's those two images, put them together.

386
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,400
 When it says, when David says he restores my soul, here's what he's saying.

387
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,400
 I know what it looks like to have wandered away from the shepherd and for the shepherd

388
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,360
 to bring me back and to nurse me back to health.

389
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,240
 And I'm just going to tell you, I know exactly what it feels like for the Lord to restore

390
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
 my soul.

391
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,720
 Post-college, I graduated from Texas A&M University.

392
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
 Thank you.

393
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
 Yeah.

394
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,200
 And then I moved back to Dallas.

395
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:33,760
 And when I was here post-college, I just gave myself over to a season of sin.

396
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,260
 It was a season where I wanted to do what I wanted to do.

397
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:46,840
 And so it was a season marked by impurity, hiding, and hypocrisy.

398
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,600
 I was actually interning here at this church, Watermark, working with high school students,

399
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,240
 telling them to live one way.

400
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,120
 And then I was going out and living a different way.

401
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,700
 I was going to seminary at the time to become a professional Christian.

402
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,680
 Living in hypocrisy.

403
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,640
 Do you know what happened during that season?

404
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,920
 What really happened was I believed a lie.

405
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
 Here's the lie that I believed.

406
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:22,600
 I believed that I could do what I wanted to do, living in sin, and still be close with

407
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
 Jesus.

408
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,320
 Like I believed a lie.

409
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,800
 Like I told myself, like, "Man, I'm making poor decisions.

410
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,960
 I'm asking God's forgiveness for it.

411
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,560
 I'm reading my Bible.

412
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,800
 I'm praying.

413
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,920
 I'm doing ministry.

414
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,560
 I'm helping other people learn about Jesus.

415
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,600
 But then I'm going back and I'm doing bad decisions.

416
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
 I start the cycle over.

417
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,200
 I say I'm sorry.

418
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
 I go and serve.

419
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,400
 I read my Bible."

420
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:52,840
 And so I believed that I could engage in the sin and still be close with Jesus.

421
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,080
 And it was a lie.

422
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,880
 And without realizing it during that extended period of doing what I wanted to do, that

423
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:11,440
 short-term gratification was laying the roots for long-term shame and pain.

424
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:19,160
 And God loved me enough to yank me back into His fold.

425
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,520
 And it hurt deeply.

426
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,160
 And I would say I could point at that season of my life when God the Good Shepherd yanked

427
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,480
 me back.

428
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,080
 He stripped everything away from my life.

429
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,500
 And He took me to rock bottom so that He could rebuild me.

430
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,440
 And He changed my life.

431
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
 Changed my life.

432
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,720
 I ended up going and traveling abroad.

433
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,920
 And every day I just spent the day with Jesus.

434
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,320
 Like I would wake up early in the morning and I would wake up praying and I would just

435
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,960
 journal my heart out to the Lord.

436
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,680
 And I would read a chapter of Acts each day and I would journal through that.

437
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,560
 And then I would email friends from home just telling them what God was doing in my life.

438
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:11,060
 And when I landed back in Texas, it was a different person.

439
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,340
 And I remember talking to a friend who had watched me hit rock bottom.

440
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,820
 And here's the words that he said.

441
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:21,900
 He said, "I hear life in you again.

442
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,340
 I hear life in you."

443
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,680
 Why?

444
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,520
 Because the Good Shepherd had restored my soul.

445
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,980
 And that's the beauty of God's grace.

446
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,620
 I don't know what you brought into this room tonight.

447
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,820
 I don't know if you're sitting there saying, "God could never forgive me."

448
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,660
 If you're carrying massive amounts of shame around, I don't know what you've done.

449
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,700
 I don't need to know what you've done.

450
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,900
 The size of your sin displays the size of our God.

451
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:01,760
 Jesus Christ in His work on the cross through His death, His burial, and His resurrection,

452
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,620
 it is sufficient to make you new.

453
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:14,360
 And that's what God did for me, is He restored my soul.

454
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,480
 But maybe you're here tonight and my story is similar to your story.

455
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,580
 Maybe you've known Jesus for a long time, but ever since you graduated college, I mean,

456
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,020
 that's what happened to my friends.

457
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,520
 Like my friends, my group of friends were guys that loved Jesus in college and then

458
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:40,020
 everyone graduated and we all came to Dallas and guys just were like, "Ah, the world."

459
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,400
 And so guys just that love Jesus in college, they just jump headfirst into the ways of

460
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,800
 the world for an extended period of time.

461
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
 And maybe that's you.

462
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,960
 Maybe you've wandered away from Jesus.

463
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,880
 Maybe you're in your early 30s and you've been wandering now for a decade.

464
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,120
 And I just want to lovingly tell you, I mean, you've believed a lie.

465
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,720
 You've believed a lie that you can come here each Tuesday night and you can worship God,

466
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,480
 you can go home, you can read your Bible, and then you can jump into sin and God's good

467
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,720
 with it.

468
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,800
 He loves you deeply.

469
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,960
 And yet you have two choices.

470
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,080
 You can either run home to Him or you can wait for Him to yank you back.

471
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,320
 And one's a lot more painful than the other.

472
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,800
 So this is me just gently and lovingly saying, "I know what it feels like to get yanked back

473
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,500
 by the Good Shepherd."

474
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,080
 And it's a great act of love.

475
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,040
 And God will never punish you out of anger.

476
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,940
 He will discipline you out of love.

477
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,540
 Come home tonight.

478
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,640
 Come back into the fold tonight.

479
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:02,760
 If you've wandered away, there is a Good Shepherd who wants to restore your soul and breathe

480
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,480
 life back into your bones.

481
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,640
 Number three, God wants to lead you.

482
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,680
 He wants to lead you.

483
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,560
 David says, "He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake."

484
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,920
 David says, "He leads me in paths of righteousness."

485
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:28,600
 That phrase, "paths of righteousness" in the Hebrew just means, "He leads me on right paths."

486
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,620
 So it's the idea of a shepherd who knows his role.

487
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,340
 His role is to lead the sheep.

488
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,480
 He calls the sheep by name, and the sheep follow Him, and He leads them to places that

489
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,020
 they need to go.

490
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,880
 David is saying, "That is what God has done for me."

491
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:49,620
 David is saying, "I was a shepherd as a teenager, so I know what it's like to lead the sheep

492
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,440
 on right paths, and that's exactly what God has done for me."

493
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,000
 And I think that that's so interesting for David to look at his life and say, "God led

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,040
 me on the right paths."

495
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,960
 The reason I think that's so interesting is I shared some of this last week, but if you're

496
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,720
 not that familiar with David's life, David found out that he was going to be the king

497
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,360
 of the nation of Israel around the age of 15.

498
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,800
 Do you know what age he finally became king?

499
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
 30.

500
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,360
 Do you know what he was doing for those 15 years?

501
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:26,820
 He was running for his life, and yet he can look back and say, "God led me on the right

502
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,820
 paths."

503
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:35,160
 I mean, you look at David's life, finds out at 15 that he's going to be king.

504
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,140
 What would you do if you found out you were going to be king of a nation at 15?

505
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,920
 How arrogant would you be?

506
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,000
 I would be.

507
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 You know what David does?

508
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,240
 He finds out he's going to be king, and then the next day he's back out in the country

509
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,460
 taking care of his sheep.

510
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,520
 And then he's not even old enough to go and fight the Philistine army.

511
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,560
 He shows up, the whole nation of Israel is trembling in fear at this giant named Goliath.

512
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
 What does David do?

513
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,600
 He takes a step of faith, and he drops the giant.

514
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,300
 But then even after that, you know what he did?

515
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,000
 Even as he comes home from slaying Goliath, and everyone's fangirling over David, women

516
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,880
 are writing songs about David.

517
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
 And yet what does he do?

518
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,720
 He goes and plays the harp for the king.

519
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,020
 The king tries to kill him.

520
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,920
 It says that he threw a spear at David twice.

521
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,400
 That means David had a spear thrown at him, and then came back and kept playing the harp.

522
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,760
 And then a second spear got thrown.

523
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,440
 He's like, "Okay, I better leave this time."

524
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,080
 And he actually leaves.

525
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,680
 Good call.

526
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
 And then he goes on the run.

527
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,040
 And when he goes on the run, Saul, the current king, is trying to kill him.

528
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,160
 And then there's this interesting story in Scripture where Saul goes into a cave to

529
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,280
 take care of some business, use the bathroom in case you're not following, and David happens

530
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,880
 to be in that cave.

531
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,760
 And all of his friends is like, "This is it.

532
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
 Kill him.

533
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,040
 Like, he's never been in a more vulnerable position.

534
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
 This is your time.

535
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 Kill him and take the throne."

536
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
 David's like, "I'm not going to do that, because now's not the time.

537
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,200
 He's the king."

538
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,140
 And so I tell you that just to say David knew that God wanted to lead him.

539
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,560
 God wanted to be his leader, and David made a decision.

540
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,120
 My God, my shepherd, is trustworthy.

541
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,060
 I can trust him to lead me.

542
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:40,600
 Even if I can't see how the path turns out, even if I can't see where we're headed, and

543
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:47,640
 even if the path is difficult, I can trust the shepherd.

544
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,720
 He will lead me on right paths.

545
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,200
 And David said, "He leads me on paths of righteousness."

546
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
 For what?

547
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
 For his name's sake.

548
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,320
 What was the result of David's life?

549
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,120
 The result was that he was a great man of character, and a bunch of people began to

550
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,040
 follow him.

551
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:12,640
 In the nation of Israel, God's people flourished, and God was famous to the nations through

552
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,800
 the leadership of David.

553
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,280
 It was for his name's sake.

554
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,800
 See, I tell you that just to say, "What does God want to do?"

555
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
 He wants to lead you on the right paths.

556
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,980
 But it's going to require you to make a decision.

557
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,600
 Is God a trustworthy leader?

558
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,400
 Even when you can't see where the path will end up, even when the path is difficult, can

559
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,960
 God be trusted?

560
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,680
 About a year and a half ago, my youngest son, Jake, he's five and a half now.

561
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,080
 He was right around four at the time.

562
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,200
 And we were at home, and it was time for family dinner.

563
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,600
 And Jake went, I heard him, in our home in College Station, there was a kitchen table,

564
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 and then about 15 feet away was a bathroom.

565
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,880
 And so Jake went to the bathroom, didn't wash his hands, and came out to eat dinner.

566
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,520
 I said, "Jake, you've got to go wash his hands."

567
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,960
 He didn't want to wash his hands.

568
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,320
 I said, "Okay, Jake, here's the deal.

569
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,560
 You cannot sit down at the table and eat dinner until you've washed his hands."

570
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,720
 And he lost his ever-loving mind.

571
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
 And so here's what I did.

572
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,960
 I took Jake to his room and said, "Jake, you're going to sit in your room.

573
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,080
 We're going to go eat dinner," because he's losing his mind.

574
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,400
 He's not going to interrupt our dinner.

575
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,120
 I said, "Ma'am, I'd love for you to come eat dinner with us, but you're going to have to

576
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,320
 wash your hands before you come eat dinner."

577
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,180
 This is so great.

578
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,720
 So I go back to the table, and I'm eating dinner with my wife and my two other sons.

579
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:45,040
 And Jake finally comes out of his room, and I hear him go into the bathroom right by our

580
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
 kitchen.

581
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
 I hear him turn on the sink.

582
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,480
 He's washing his hands.

583
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,000
 And from the bathroom, I'm sitting there eating my food.

584
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,360
 Jake, four-year-old Jake, is in the bathroom, and here's the words I hear come out of his

585
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:03,320
 mouth, "I hate this place."

586
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,040
 I loved that moment so much.

587
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
 It was amazing.

588
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,520
 "I hate this place."

589
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,680
 And I think about that, I'm like, "Man, that escalated quickly."

590
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,640
 That's why he hated this place, because he had to wash his hands if he wanted to eat

591
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
 dinner.

592
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,400
 So quickly, he lost trust in me.

593
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 Why?

594
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,720
 Because he didn't like my ways.

595
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,340
 He wanted to do what he wanted to do.

596
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,160
 He thought that I was in some way trying to steal from him.

597
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,400
 He was convinced that there was a better way.

598
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,560
 And I just think about us.

599
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,280
 I'm like, "How quickly do we lose trust in God?"

600
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,640
 When we can't see where the path is headed, when the path gets difficult, we lose complete

601
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,080
 trust in Him, and we don't fully trust Him to lead us.

602
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,640
 So we decide God's way is not the best way.

603
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,880
 It might be a way, but sometimes it's not the best way, so we're going to do things

604
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,480
 our way.

605
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,400
 And so I'll just say this, there's been plenty of times in my life where I've chosen to trust

606
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,600
 in my own leadership more than God's leadership.

607
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:24,620
 And now that I look over an extended season of life, I'm 42, when I look back, you want

608
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:30,280
 to know the times in my life where I've said, "I hate this place."

609
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,140
 Do you know when it is?

610
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,700
 It's when I've insisted on doing things my way instead of God's way.

611
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,760
 Like when I lived for that extended season doing what I wanted to do, do you know what

612
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,240
 place it landed me in?

613
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,280
 It landed me in a season of brokenness, rock bottom, full of shame.

614
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,560
 I hated that place.

615
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,920
 There was a season of my life where people who hurt me, I allowed bitterness and resentment

616
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,800
 to well up inside of me and it was toxic to my soul for five years.

617
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,580
 I hated that place.

618
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:12,560
 The times when my wife and I get into a fight and I operate in the flesh and I'm just trying

619
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,440
 to win the fight instead of understand and resolve the fight, I hate that place.

620
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,040
 Where I'm like, "I just want to get back to laughing with my wife, enjoying time with

621
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
 my wife."

622
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:31,000
 I hate that place of being in conflict with her.

623
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,920
 The places that I hate in life are always a result of me choosing to trust in myself

624
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,360
 instead of the leadership of the Good Shepherd.

625
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:51,320
 God wants to lead you and He wants to lead you for His name's sake.

626
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,360
 I tell you that just to say as followers of Jesus Christ, we will either bring shame or

627
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,200
 fame to God's name.

628
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,360
 We'll either bring shame or fame to His name.

629
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,680
 I remember I was a student pastor in Austin and after the Sunday service was over, I was

630
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,920
 cleaning up the room and there was a high school kid who left a note for me and what

631
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,280
 he did was he quoted, he wrote a quote that people have attributed to Gandhi.

632
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,560
 I don't know if he said it or not, but what he wrote a note to me saying, "TA, I like

633
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,640
 your Christ, not your Christians."

634
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,080
 And the last time I checked his Facebook, he would identify himself as an agnostic.

635
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,180
 And I would just say how we live and whether we choose to trust the leadership of the Good

636
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:40,160
 Shepherd, it will either bring shame or fame to the name of Jesus.

637
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,240
 So let me just tell you how I started my day today.

638
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,880
 This is just straight out of my prayer journal.

639
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,560
 This is what it looks like for me because I'm in the same place as you just because

640
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,720
 I'm a pastor, that doesn't make me that much, that doesn't put me in a higher place than

641
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,720
 you.

642
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
 Like we are all in this together.

643
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
 This is what it looked like.

644
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,480
 This is how I had to start my day.

645
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,640
 There is no God but you.

646
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,640
 Today I exist to know you, to be satisfied in you and to make much of you.

647
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,600
 All glory belongs to you.

648
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,600
 Be glorified through my life today.

649
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:19,120
 The only reason I have breath in my lungs is to praise you, to behold you and to point

650
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,440
 others to you.

651
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,080
 Lord, have your way in me today.

652
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,120
 There is no area of my life which is off limits.

653
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:34,040
 That's just me saying, "God, I will choose today to trust your leadership."

654
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,480
 Okay?

655
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
 God wants to lead you.

656
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,400
 And then finally, this last point is specifically for the people in the room who do not yet

657
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,960
 have a relationship with Jesus.

658
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,000
 So if that's you, I'm so glad you came tonight.

659
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,960
 What I want you to hear is God wants to save you.

660
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,280
 And you're like, "I don't need saving."

661
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,520
 Well, here's all I want to do.

662
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,680
 I just want to read a few verses of scripture.

663
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,280
 I'm just going to read it.

664
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,760
 And just let God do what he wants to do in your life.

665
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,660
 So I would just ask you to listen to these verses to process what they're saying in light

666
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:20,280
 of David saying, "You'd lead me in paths of righteousness."

667
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,840
 He's saying God leads us on the right path.

668
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:33,560
 Proverbs 14, 12 says this, "There is a way that seems right to man, but its end is the

669
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,040
 way to death."

670
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:46,440
 Matthew 7, 13 and 14 say, "Jesus says, 'Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and

671
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,320
 the way is easy that leads to destruction.

672
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,760
 In those who enter by it are many.

673
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,960
 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life.

674
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,520
 In those who find it are few."

675
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:09,720
 And Jesus says in John 14, 6, "I am the way and the truth and the life.

676
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,600
 No one comes to the Father except through me."

677
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:20,360
 Isaiah 53, 6 says this, "All we like sheep have gone astray.

678
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:29,920
 We have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord has laid on him, on Jesus, the iniquity

679
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,760
 of us all."

680
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,760
 And then finally Jesus says in John 10, 27 through 29, he says, "My sheep hear my voice

681
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,480
 and I know them and they follow me.

682
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,680
 I give them eternal life and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of

683
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,320
 my hand.

684
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,440
 My Father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them

685
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,360
 out of the Father's hand."

686
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,320
 I hope you hear tonight what God wants to do for you.

687
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,840
 He wants to save you.

688
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,760
 If you're sitting there saying, "I don't need saving."

689
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,720
 Well, according to the Scriptures, every single one of us like a sheep has gone astray.

690
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
 What does that mean?

691
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,580
 Each of us has turned to his own way.

692
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:14,720
 We have looked at God's way and we've said, "I'll find a better way."

693
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,840
 And because of that, because of that sin, what do we deserve?

694
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,940
 We deserve hell.

695
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,160
 We deserve eternal separation from God.

696
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,080
 And yet, what does the text say?

697
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:30,960
 That God has caused the iniquity to be laid on Jesus Christ.

698
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,960
 When he died on the cross, he was being punished for you and me.

699
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,320
 When he rose from the dead, he was displaying that his victory was enough for you and me.

700
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,560
 So that when you put your trust in Jesus Christ, when you follow Jesus Christ, what does John

701
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,420
 10 say he does?

702
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,360
 He gives eternal life to us.

703
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,840
 He wants to save you and me.

704
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:57,840
 If you've never put your trust in Jesus Christ, tonight is the night.

705
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,240
 Tonight is the night.

706
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,520
 So you know what God wants to do for you tonight?

707
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,600
 You know what he wants to do?

708
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,440
 He wants to satisfy you tonight.

709
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:17,080
 Tonight he wants to satisfy the deepest longings of your soul.

710
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:24,360
 Tonight what he wants to do is he wants to restore you.

711
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,880
 He wants to lead you and he wants to save you.

712
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
 That's what he wants to do.

713
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,680
 The possibilities are amazing.

714
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,720
 Will you take a step?

715
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:43,800
 Let's pray together.

716
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,000
 And let me just ask, just with your eyes closed, we don't do this all the time, but I just

717
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,080
 want to ask if you're here tonight and you want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ,

718
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,680
 with your eyes closed, would you just slip up your hand real quick so I know who I'm

719
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,800
 talking to in this place tonight?

720
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,200
 If that's you, it's great.

721
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,640
 It's awesome.

722
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,920
 And if that is you, I just want to invite you in this moment, would you just say, there's

723
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,600
 nothing magical about this prayer.

724
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,640
 It's just you telling God what you want to be true.

725
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:20,400
 Would you just tell him, Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?

726
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,900
 Say Lord Jesus, thank you that you died on the cross for me.

727
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:31,060
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

728
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,720
 Would you come into my life?

729
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,840
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

730
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:46,760
 And would you lead me in a new life with you as my savior and as my king?

731
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,440
 Say I give my life to you tonight, Jesus.

732
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,800
 And if you've been walking with Jesus for decades, would you just do business with him

733
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,320
 right now?

734
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,320
 Would you just invite him to do a new work in your life, whether it's satisfying you,

735
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:10,680
 restoring you, leading you, whatever it is, would you talk to him and invite him in to

736
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,680
 do his work?

737
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,880
 And then we'll respond in song in just a moment.

738
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,540
 (ominous music)

739
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,040
 (eerie music)
