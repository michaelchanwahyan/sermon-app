[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.100]   - Love it, like born identity, let's go.
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.400]   Tonight we're kicking off some new series called Amnesia,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.100]   where we just explore what it looks like
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.420]   specifically for Christians who struggle
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.360]   with short-term memory loss like all of us do,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.160]   and what it looks like to remember who we are in Christ,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.720]   remember who God is, remember our purpose,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.220]   and why you are on this planet in general.
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.120]   So for the next four weeks,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.080]   really we're gonna explore those topics.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.180]   So welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.040]   welcome friends in Fort Worth, in Houston,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.960]   and in the woodlands.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.880]   I'm gonna start off with a question.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.020]   Hey, who's Amazon Prime members in here?
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.400]   Anybody in Amazon Prime?
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.040]   There you go, all right, come on.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.520]   Man, I may end up trying to convince the rest of you
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.840]   why you should be an Amazon Prime.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.840]   I got an Amazon Prime membership not long ago
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080]   as a gift at Christmas, Amazon Prime.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.440]   I'll explain what it is in case you're like,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.940]   what is he talking about right now?
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.480]   Man, you have no idea how exciting this night is for you.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.320]   This is free.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.760]   I was given this gift where it's a year-long membership.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   Pay 90 bucks, get this membership, Amazon Prime.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.960]   At the time I'm going, man, I don't know how often
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.480]   we're gonna use this, but free two-day shipping,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.760]   this is cool, I guess.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.960]   Little did I know that I would be making an investment
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.140]   in Jeff Bezos' future, and in the future
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.920]   of lots of dollars that I would make,
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.000]   would end up going all to the Amazon incorporation
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.760]   as we would become the family
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.960]   that we buy everything on Amazon.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.680]   It has changed the way that we shop,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.620]   and if you know what I'm talking about,
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.800]   it's free two-day shipping,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   and it crushes every price you're out.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   You're out at the grocery, like, yeah,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.800]   is this paper towels?
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.280]   Hold on, let me see.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160]   Yeah, I can get 30 cents lower.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.200]   We'll buy it on Amazon.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.440]   I can wait two days, it'll be fine.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.320]   It's totally changed the way that we experience
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.200]   purchasing, Christmas gifts, everything we buy now
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.660]   on Amazon Prime, it's amazing.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.840]   Not only did it have two-day shipping,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660]   but someone came along and began to say,
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.140]   hey, you know what else comes with that membership?
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.200]   And I had no idea.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.500]   I was like, I thought it was just kind of a shipping
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.920]   relationship that I had with Amazon,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.020]   and they said, no, there's all kinds of stuff
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.860]   that come with it.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.940]   If you're an Amazon Prime member,
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.460]   you get Amazon Photos, which is unlimited online storage.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.340]   It's like a Dropbox account, unlimited,
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.880]   so if you have a Prime, you have that.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.780]   You have unlimited Amazon Music,
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.540]   which is like over a million songs, like Spotify.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720]   You have Prime Video, which is like its own version
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.880]   of Netflix, you have all these different things
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.400]   that come with Amazon.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.800]   I'm just trying to get a sponsorship by Jeff Bezos.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.820]   So Jeff, if you hear me, I'm open to it.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.460]   Oh, this is awesome, Amazon Prime Now has come out.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.560]   Anybody seen Prime Now?
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560]   Look, this is crazy.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.800]   All right, so you can buy things,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   and they are two-hour free shipping.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.440]   You go online, download the Prime Now app,
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.280]   and if you want something, you can select it,
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.120]   and within two hours for free,
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940]   you get stuff delivered to your door,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.480]   all of which I had no idea about.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.860]   I did not realize all that was coming
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.480]   with this gift that I had received.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.240]   It's true, you can be buying, I see you right now
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.460]   buying stuff on there right now.
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.680]   Here's why I start with that story,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.280]   and here's why I open up with that.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.220]   Because in the same way that in that scenario,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.780]   I had been given this gift, and I did not realize,
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.400]   oh man, all that came with it.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.040]   There were all kinds of different things
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   that were a part of this gift.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.640]   I just thought it was shipping.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.800]   I didn't realize the fullness of everything
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.240]   that came with it in the same way
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.840]   as it relates to the Christian faith.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.040]   I think most of us in the room
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.380]   either fail to understand everything that comes,
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.520]   what you have received.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.120]   If you're a Christian, I'm talking specifically to you
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.200]   tonight, what you have received
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.540]   when you put your faith in Jesus,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.900]   when you became a Christian,
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.520]   what came with that, if you will?
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   And they fail to remember or fail to understand
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.680]   all that they've received in Christ.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.120]   In fact, tonight, if you're not a Christian,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.680]   you'll get a window into, as we explore the words of Paul,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.900]   really, if you ever were to become a Christian,
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.200]   what that entails, what comes along with that account
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.720]   or that membership, if you will,
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.560]   when you become placed in Jesus,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.760]   you say, hey, I'm trusting Jesus
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.660]   and what he did on the cross for my sin.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.680]   You become a Christian.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.560]   Tonight, we're gonna explore all that you have in Christ,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   and here's why I think this is so crucial.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.040]   As we open up this series, I don't think that
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.640]   most of you have a problem with learning.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.080]   You need to learn more of what you have in Christ.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.880]   It is a remembering or a realizing
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.880]   and fully understanding what Jesus has given to you
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.120]   when you trusted in him, and if you and I fail to realize
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   or fully understand what you have received
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.040]   when you received Christ,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.080]   which was not just a free ticket to heaven,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.800]   you received so much more, and if you fail to realize that,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.960]   you and I are in danger of spending the rest of our lives
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.880]   aimlessly wandering, not experiencing our purpose,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.600]   not experiencing the abundant life that God has created
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.380]   and wired you and I for,
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.800]   the adventure that all of us, like inside, deep down,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.760]   we all want to have, the relationship with God
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.600]   that all of us, when we go to bed at night,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.000]   wanna have that peace with God,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.880]   and if you and I are not quick to embrace
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.480]   the three things specifically here,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   then you'll end up spending the rest of your life
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.040]   searching for that peace,
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.440]   and specifically, if you don't embrace all three,
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.200]   then you'll end up spending an eternal life away from God.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   So tonight, we're gonna explore what you have in Christ.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.120]   If you take notes, you can write out Amnesia, Part One,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.960]   what you have in Christ.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.880]   We're gonna be in 2 Corinthians, Chapter Five.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.520]   2 Corinthians, Chapter Five, you have a Bible
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.140]   you can flip over to 2 Corinthians.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.620]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, Corinthians,
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.420]   there's one of 'em, then you go to two,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.060]   there we are, 2 Corinthians.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.740]   Paul writes this letter to 2 Corinthians,
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.860]   we'll be in Chapter Five, and we'll pick up in Verse 14.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.820]   Here's what's going on.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.460]   The New Testament, 2 Corinthians is one of several
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.980]   different letters between the Apostle Paul
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.500]   and these different churches that he would either start
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.700]   or somebody else would start,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.340]   and Paul was this big leader within the old church
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.500]   or within the ancient church,
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.740]   and so he would write them and be like,
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.280]   "Hey, this is how you live out your new Christian faith."
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.340]   So he's writing to the church in Corinth.
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.740]   Corinth is this city that is very pagan,
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.060]   so it is like Las Vegas.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.060]   What happens in Corinth stays in Corinth.
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.280]   That's Corinth.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.980]   True story, I mean, the term Corinthian in the first century
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.980]   was synonymous with a stripper or a call girl,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.780]   so like, "I'm in love with a Corinthian."
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.780]   That was going on for the Corinthian church.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.020]   That's what, when you saw, "Hey, she's a Corinthian, dude,"
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.020]   it's like, "Hey, my mama, I'm not messing with that.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.340]   "She would not like it if I took that Corinthian home."
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.260]   That's what a Corinthian was.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.300]   So this is a very pagan society.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.260]   Temple of Aphrodite is there, all kinds of pagan worship.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.860]   These people trust in Jesus.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.180]   They're trying to figure this thing out.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.380]   How do we live out this new life in Christ?
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.500]   Paul writes a couple letters to him that we have,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.060]   and he begins to address,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.940]   "This is what it looks like to live out the Christian faith,"
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.740]   and specifically where we are here,
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.800]   he begins to lay out,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.340]   "Hey, this is the new life that you have.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.400]   "This is the new things that you have now in Christ.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.340]   "Whether or not you realized it when you trusted in him."
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.980]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse 14,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.660]   and we will explore the new point of view
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.780]   that you and I have,
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.660]   the new permanent status,
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.060]   and that'll make more sense here in a second,
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.540]   that you and I have,
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.180]   and then the new purpose that you and I,
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.460]   when you trusted in Jesus, were given in Christ,
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.660]   the new purpose, the new point of view,
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.180]   new permanent status,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.100]   and new purpose that you have in life.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.060]   Paul, just to set up where he's,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.520]   he's about to tell us the thing that drove his ministry.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   Paul, most influential missionary the world has ever seen.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.920]   Time Magazine would even say,
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.940]   "One of the most influential people of all time."
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.780]   That's Paul.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.480]   Artist formerly known as Saul,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.680]   and he was a guy that went around killing Christians
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.240]   'til he met Jesus, and everything changed.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.080]   And he's about to say,
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.000]   "Hey, you know what drove my ministry
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.700]   "that will go far beyond what any of us in this room
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.960]   "will ever accomplish?"
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.280]   In other words, in 2,000 years,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.840]   they are not gonna be reading my letters
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.840]   or your letters to anybody,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.980]   but Paul, that's what exactly we're doing.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.860]   And he's about to tell us
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.820]   what drove the incredible ministry that he had.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.220]   We'll begin in verse 14.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:51.100]   For Christ's love compels us, or drives us,
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.900]   because we are convinced that one, that's Jesus,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.240]   died for all, and therefore all died.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.740]   That Jesus died so that everyone didn't have to.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.460]   He died in our place.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.560]   And he died for all, so that those who live,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:04.900]   so that the new life,
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.580]   everyone who's a Christian, if you will,
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.600]   everyone who receives the new life in Christ,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.800]   should no longer live for themselves,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.820]   but for him who died for them, that's Jesus,
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.740]   and was raised again.
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.480]   So from now on, we regard no one
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.980]   with a worldly point of view.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.220]   We see things from a different point of view.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.980]   Though we once regarded Christ in this way,
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.480]   we do so no longer.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.860]   So Paul points out our very first point from this text,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.260]   that when you became a Christian,
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.860]   you were given, and now you have a new point of view,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.840]   a new perspective on the life in the world around you,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.540]   that it has become to influence your thinking
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.900]   and Paul said, hey, when you became a Christian,
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.340]   all of a sudden, everything changed.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.580]   You may not have realized it,
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.080]   but your thinking, your perspective on the world around you,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.380]   on yourself, on other people, all began to change.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.480]   This is why for many of you, like you've experienced,
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.520]   you were hanging around the porch,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.640]   you were coming for a while,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.020]   you didn't know what you think about Jesus,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.180]   what you thought about God,
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.680]   and you were kinda coming here,
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.180]   you had one foot in the church,
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.460]   one foot in the world,
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.120]   hanging here on Tuesday, in the club on Friday,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.100]   here living this mixed life,
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.520]   and all of a sudden, you kept coming
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.860]   and at some point, you trusted in Jesus.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.220]   And your point of view began to change.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.060]   And all of a sudden, you have been,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.260]   if you've experienced this change,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.900]   you're not even as good at sinning as you used to be.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.300]   It's not as fun anymore,
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.340]   you're not as good at picking up girls at the club,
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.600]   you're not as good with a pickup line,
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.300]   instead of being like, oh man, I'm so smooth,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.300]   you're like, hey girl, do you go to church anywhere?
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.380]   And you're like, man, what is wrong
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.920]   with everything's beginning to change
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.380]   because your perspective, all of a sudden,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.840]   you're going to the club and it's like
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.280]   these new goggles have been put on
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.420]   and you're like, man, the bar's not as fun
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.820]   as I used to think it was.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.920]   Getting wasted every Friday night
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.360]   that I used to think was awesome,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.420]   all of a sudden, I'm like, man,
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.060]   this is really boring and dumb.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.460]   We do the same thing every Friday
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.000]   and I can never remember it.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.140]   All of a sudden, you're able to see
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.040]   a new point of view on life, on yourself,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.040]   on the world around you.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.580]   And not only that,
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.880]   you're also given this new point of view,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.740]   Paul says, as it relates to other believers,
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.880]   or I'm sorry, as it relates to other people in the world.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.180]   Like you've been given this new ability
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.680]   to see people not as someone who's annoying
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.020]   or in your way or that crazy person
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.660]   who lives upstairs in your apartment complex
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.760]   or the person in the cubicle next to you
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.260]   who annoys you at work or the dorm room next to you
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.460]   or whatever the situation.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.100]   All of a sudden, this begins to happen
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.000]   in the life of a Christian where they go from like,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.860]   man, that's my crazy uncle at Thanksgiving
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.240]   to I wonder if he knows Jesus.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.440]   I wonder if he has a faith.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.340]   And all of a sudden, you go from thinking that way
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.980]   to beginning to dialogue with people
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.740]   because you no longer see people as like,
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.080]   man, they're either a problem, they're annoying,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.240]   I don't know, I'm busy, gotta go.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.960]   You all of a sudden begin to see people for who they are,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.720]   someone with an eternal soul
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.600]   that will live forever somewhere.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.660]   You begin to realize that, man,
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.460]   everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.700]   Like there are no mere mortals.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.540]   Every person you've ever laid eyeball, eye to eye with,
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.640]   you've ever seen is someone who will live eternally with God
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.980]   or eternally away from Him
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.900]   based on what they do with Jesus.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.100]   And all of a sudden, it's like you become awake.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.420]   And this new point of view becomes a part of how you think.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.440]   Everywhere that you go, you're like,
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.880]   man, that person behind the counter at the gas station,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.620]   regardless of how they look,
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.160]   regardless of the color of their skin,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.760]   the amount of money they make, all of them,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.660]   every politician on a TV screen,
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.640]   every one of them is someone that Jesus,
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.160]   it's not just some talking head,
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.500]   it's someone Jesus, my Savior, died for.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.260]   Someone with an eternal soul,
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.600]   someone who the salvation of that single person
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.240]   is worth more than anything I will accomplish in this life.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.220]   Any job accomplishment, any success in a career,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.620]   you begin to all of a sudden see,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.220]   your mind becomes awake and you can see people.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.540]   And you do see people with a new point of view.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.460]   And Paul says that's because
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.240]   that's what you were given in Christ.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.180]   All of a sudden, you can see people for who they are.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.340]   I know that there's a lot of you that see it this way
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.500]   because I go out and engaging and communicating
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.060]   and talking with people in the city.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.860]   I bump into people who have already bumped into you
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.180]   or bumped into people from here
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.020]   that I've already been talking about.
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.060]   A few weeks ago, I was getting my haircut at Great Clips,
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.420]   which is pretty 50/50 on the great part,
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.220]   but it is inexpensive.
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.620]   And I apologize, Great Clips, if you're in the room,
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.140]   I'm also open to a sponsorship.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.820]   That's so wrong.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.500]   (laughing)
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.740]   That's so wrong, I'm not looking for a sponsorship.
[00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.900]   So I'm getting my haircut, I'm rolling the dice again,
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.660]   and I'm talking to a lady and I'm like,
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.820]   "Hey, do you have a faith?"
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.900]   And she goes, "You know, I was raised Catholic,
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.220]   "but I need to get baptized in a church
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.180]   "and I'm trying to figure out how we begin dialogue."
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.540]   Halfway through her answer, she stops me.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.700]   She says, "But let me ask you a question.
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.140]   "Do you go to the porch?"
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.780]   I said, "I do go to the porch."
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.260]   And she said, and I said, "How do you know?"
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.060]   And she said, "Because the people from the porch,
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.420]   "they're always coming in here asking me about Jesus
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:06.700]   "and talking to me about Jesus,
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.780]   "and they're always coming in here."
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.020]   And I was like, "Man, you know why they do that?"
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.660]   Yeah, you can golf clap for that, sure.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.780]   You know why they're doing that?
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.620]   Stay with me.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.660]   Because they see you differently.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.980]   Like they don't just see, this is the haircut lady,
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.060]   they say this is a person with a name,
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.660]   with a soul, with an eternal destiny.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.220]   And so I'm gonna engage with her
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:37.020]   because I've begun to be able to see clearly.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.220]   I've been given a new point of view.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.900]   Some of you, honestly, in the room right now
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:44.340]   are in the room because of someone who saw you differently
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.060]   and said, "Man, I wonder if they know
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.400]   "how much God loves them.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.720]   "I wonder if they know that there's a God
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.500]   "who hasn't forgotten them, who cares about them.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.740]   "I wonder if they know who hasn't given up on them.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.360]   "There's a God out there who hadn't given up on them.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.180]   "I'm gonna invite them, I'm gonna engage with them,
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.200]   "invite them to church, ask them what they believe
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.820]   "because I see them from a different point of view."
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.020]   And Paul says, "That's because you received it in Christ."
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.180]   He also says something else that you received in Christ.
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.540]   Here's what he says in verse 17, the next idea.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.420]   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.700]   "the new creation has come, a change has taken place.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.700]   "The old has gone and this new thing is here."
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.540]   All of this, this new creation, this new relationship,
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.540]   this new status or standing the Bible uses,
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.820]   but we could use the word status
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.620]   as it relates to a relationship with God.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.960]   All of this comes from one place.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.340]   Where does it come from?
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.540]   God.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.820]   All of this comes from God, this new relationship.
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.060]   If a person becomes a Christian, it doesn't happen
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:44.900]   'cause they're like, "You know what?
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.960]   "I'm just gonna decide this today."
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.580]   Whether they realize it or not, it all came from God.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.780]   God was the initiator.
[00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.580]   And it was God who reconciled us to himself through Christ
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.260]   and he gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.380]   That God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.980]   not counting people's sins against them.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.820]   That Paul just introduced this huge idea
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.500]   that when you trusted Jesus,
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.500]   when you put your faith in Christ,
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.300]   you were placed into Christ.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.860]   And it was though as your life
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.700]   was placed into Jesus's life, if you will.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.980]   The Bible also talks about, hey, Christ in you.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.460]   That's not what we're talking about tonight.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.020]   Theologically, which is just Paul's big academic,
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.180]   if you will, word here,
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.620]   or big explanation for what Paul's saying,
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.140]   he said when you became a believer,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.140]   it's like you were placed into Jesus.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.180]   And when God looks at you,
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.300]   he sees the exact same relationship he has with his son,
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.700]   Jesus, he sees with you.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.060]   If you've put your faith in Jesus,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.100]   you've trusted in what Christ did on the cross,
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.440]   his resurrection, and have accepted him
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.300]   as your Lord and Savior, you have been placed into Christ.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.980]   Your life is now hidden in him.
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.100]   When God looks at you, he sees not your sin,
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.180]   he sees his son.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.700]   Our second idea from the text tonight
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.620]   is that you, if you have trusted in Jesus,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.220]   you have been given a permanent status before God.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.700]   You have been given a permanent, unmovable,
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.140]   unchangeable status before God.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.580]   That when you've trusted in him,
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.780]   you were placed as it were inside of Jesus.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:13.780]   And the same righteousness of Jesus is your righteousness.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.340]   Not because of anything that you did,
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.860]   not because of any way that you behaved,
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.380]   but because of a moment of faith,
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.340]   I believe Jesus, I'll never be able
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.180]   to earn my way into heaven,
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.020]   I accept what you did on the cross,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.820]   that you died in my place and you rose again,
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.820]   and I can have new life because of that.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.540]   In that moment, Paul says, the Bible teaches,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.360]   God says, you are righteous, forever righteous.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.220]   Permanently, that is your relationship status with God.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.880]   Whether or not you feel righteous,
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.380]   whether or not you feel new,
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.860]   whether or not you feel worthy,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.140]   all of those things, Paul would say,
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.980]   it's not about your feelings,
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.060]   it's not about your senses,
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.420]   it is about in a moment of trust,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.520]   you accepted what God did for you,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.780]   and you have a permanent relationship status.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.840]   It will never change.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.500]   You have the righteous, as righteous as Jesus is,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.740]   even if you looked at pornography today,
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:06.700]   that's how righteous you are, as righteous as Christ.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.140]   And you may not feel like it,
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.100]   you may be counting the days since you looked at porn.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.600]   Even if you slept with your boyfriend last night,
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.980]   or slept with your homosexual boyfriend,
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.740]   your lesbian, whatever it is,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.380]   that there is nothing that keeps someone outside
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.580]   of reconciliation with God.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.060]   Sin is no longer the issue.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.300]   That Jesus and God specifically, through Christ,
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.520]   decided to do something, and it says,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.140]   I am setting sin, and I'm setting it aside.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.340]   It will no longer stand in the way.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.940]   That's what the verse says.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.400]   Not counting people's sin against them.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.800]   I'm introducing a new way
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.020]   that they will have a relationship with me.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.900]   A permanent status of righteousness.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.260]   That he's saying, the theological term is this new position
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:56.460]   that they have of in Christ, immovable, unchangeable,
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.540]   all of which is from God.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.740]   In other words, your behavior didn't get you
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.940]   into the relationship,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.180]   and it can't keep you out of the relationship.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.960]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.760]   But what about if someone sins?
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.960]   If somebody sins, there's earthly consequences
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.480]   and pain that they invite into their life,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.920]   but the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.040]   is not whosoever behaves has eternal life.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.520]   It is whosoever believes has eternal life.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.340]   And Paul says, if you trusted in Jesus,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.880]   you would be given a new status, a permanent new standing.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.740]   It's not dissimilar, the clearest illustration,
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.960]   honestly, our team was brainstorming about,
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.440]   man, what is the illustration of a time where this happens?
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.480]   It's like a father to a child.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.480]   It's probably the clearest
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.880]   where there's a permanent relationship established.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   Like my son will always be my son.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.840]   For the rest of his life,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.960]   he's gonna have a different girlfriend,
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.880]   only one, actually, he's never gonna have any,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.600]   he's gonna have different teachers,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.340]   he's gonna have different relationships
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.560]   to different people, different friends,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.160]   will come and go and all that stuff will change.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.320]   He will always be my son.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.540]   He will always be, he has my DNA,
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.500]   he will always be my child.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.400]   And I will always be his father.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.320]   It cannot, for the rest of his life, it will not change.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.260]   And in the same way, God has placed himself
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.100]   and placed you into this relationship
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.540]   for the rest of your life,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.700]   just like a father is a part of bringing a child
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.580]   into the world, God is the active agent
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.660]   who brings Christians or brings that faith about
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.700]   and has placed you permanently.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.400]   You will always be my child.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.860]   You've been placed in Christ.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.220]   And the righteousness of Jesus is now yours.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.740]   When you run from God, it's yours.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.500]   When you lie at work, when you cheat on an exam,
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.900]   when you do all the different things
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.680]   that you know better than,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.140]   maybe some things that you don't,
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.100]   if you've trusted in Jesus,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.480]   none of them change how he looks at you.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.940]   You've been placed permanently
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.320]   and given a permit status in Christ.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.140]   It almost sounds too good to be true.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.300]   Like, wait a second, like I can just,
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.860]   I can run, I can do, like I can go smoke whatever I want,
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.980]   drink whatever I want, do anything,
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.260]   and none of that's gonna change how God feels about me?
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.740]   That just sounds crazy, it sounds too good to be true.
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.200]   It is, it's otherworldly,
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.460]   because it's not like anything in this world.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.500]   It comes from a heavenly world,
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.180]   another world outside of this one.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.740]   And that feeling of like, man, this is,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.120]   oh my gosh, that's crazy, that's unbelievable.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.620]   God decided to do something
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.860]   before anything could ever be done from me.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.940]   I never did anything good,
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.100]   and God decided I'm gonna save you,
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.400]   despite everything bad that I've done.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.920]   It almost feels like, man, it's too good to be true.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.840]   That's why Paul goes where he goes next.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.380]   It is too good to be true.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.740]   It is unbelievably true, though.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.500]   It comes from another world, it's beyond true.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.820]   Here's what he says, or here's why he goes
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.940]   where he does next, like, yes, this is an amazing,
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.420]   that's why we call it good news.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.480]   Verse 20, and he has committed to us
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   the message of reconciliation,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.340]   the message that God has done something,
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.640]   that God decided to act and to give his son
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.280]   so that the world wouldn't have to work their way
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.060]   towards God, which they could not,
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.260]   that God decided to sacrifice his son
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.400]   to allow every person who's ever lived,
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.980]   if they were willing to accept it,
[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.100]   to have a relationship with him.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.260]   And he gave us this message.
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.900]   So we are therefore Christ's ambassadors,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.660]   as though God were making his appeal through us.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.120]   Like, we gotta tell somebody about this amazing news,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.500]   that's what we're here on this planet to do.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:38.400]   We implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.420]   God made him, in other words, he just gives us,
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.900]   here's the message that we tell the world around us.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.220]   Hey, be reconciled to God, or you can be reconciled to God,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.340]   because God made, verse 21, him who knew no sin,
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.860]   that's Jesus, perfect righteousness,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.920]   to become sin for you and for I,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.100]   so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.020]   Paul lays out, within the context
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.180]   of what he's talking about, a new purpose,
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.980]   our third idea, a new purpose for life.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.180]   So you have this new point of view,
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.020]   what do you have in Christ?
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:09.860]   You have this new point of view,
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.220]   all of a sudden, you begin to see things differently.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.700]   It's like sixth sense, man, I see dead people,
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.140]   I see things differently.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.380]   First thing that we have in Christ,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.900]   the second thing is that we have this permanent status.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.700]   Like, nothing can ever change that.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.940]   And then the third thing that we have in Christ
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.340]   is we've been given this new purpose in life.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.500]   We can now begin to experience the reason
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.460]   you're in on the planet right now,
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.760]   the reason that you have breath in your lungs.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.100]   Paul just laid out that you and I are now called,
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.460]   and we get to experience that purpose
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.220]   by going to call others around us in the world.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.680]   Hey, you can be reconciled to God,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.940]   that God has done something.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.340]   Every other world religion is saying,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.580]   hey, you better earn your way to heaven,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.900]   you better do a bunch of stuff,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.260]   and Christianity says, no, no, no,
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.660]   God didn't say, hey, you gotta do,
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.420]   it's about what God did on the cross.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.620]   He doesn't want you to climb the mountain,
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.180]   he came down the mountain and died for you and I,
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.220]   and anyone who accepts that can have eternal life.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.740]   That's the message of Christianity,
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.220]   and now we as ambassadors are called to go take that
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.140]   to every place and every space,
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.900]   and he says that's the purpose of your life.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.660]   Don't buy the lie of Dallas of trying to get a nicer lease
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.740]   on the next Range Rover and a bigger house,
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.940]   and when am I gonna get married,
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.460]   and when am I gonna get done with exams,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.220]   or whatever else, all the noise that's such a distraction,
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   and miss out on your purpose.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.260]   Like today, how did you do with your purpose
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.580]   of taking the message to the city around us,
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.980]   to every person that you saw today
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.460]   that will live forever somewhere, how did you do?
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.980]   Maybe just over the past week,
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.180]   and Paul says, man, let that unbelievably good news
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.940]   drive you to the place where you just are able to engage
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.260]   with people around you who are gonna spend eternity
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.300]   with God or eternity away from him,
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.780]   and say, hey, can I just tell you about what I believe,
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.700]   or hey, do you know what the Bible teaches,
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.620]   the central message of the Bible?
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.140]   Man, you don't, awesome, well, I can definitely tell
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.540]   you're an intelligent person, so let me tell you,
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.180]   because I'm sure you'll wanna know for the future
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.780]   whether or not you believe it.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.860]   The Bible simply teaches that God loved, so God gave.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.700]   God loved the world so much that he gave his son.
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.660]   He gave his son to pay for their sins.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.460]   God loved and God gave, and now we, if we believe,
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.500]   we receive eternal life, central message of the Bible.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.380]   God loved the world that was running from him so much,
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.380]   he said, I will kill my son so that you don't have to die.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.180]   He will pay for you and pay for everything you've ever done,
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.420]   pay for the sins you're gonna commit tomorrow,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.700]   and if you will accept that payment through belief,
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.420]   if you believe or we believe and we receive,
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.660]   you will have eternal life.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.020]   That's the central message of the Bible,
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.120]   and now we take that message everywhere we go,
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.660]   that God has done something, 'cause here's the reality,
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.340]   most people that you run into,
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.940]   like they haven't, they're not anti-God.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.860]   Like most people that you run into, that you work with,
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.260]   like here's the reality, the people that you work with,
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.380]   the people in your family next week at Thanksgiving,
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.380]   most people aren't anti-God, there's some,
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.220]   but it's a very small proportion of society.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.720]   They're not atheists, the majority of people,
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.540]   they're just kinda like, ah, God's out there
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.700]   and I think I need to be a good person.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.740]   I need to pay my taxes, I need to try to be nice
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.580]   and not kill anybody, and pretty much I think that'll,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.820]   and they've bought this lie.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.020]   71% of Americans, a recent study came out and said,
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:38.540]   71% of Americans believe that in order for you
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.660]   to have a relationship with God, you need to do good things.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.040]   You need to make action, you need to be a part
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.060]   of your salvation and earning it.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:47.380]   They've bought into this idea of like,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.780]   hey, God helps those who help themselves.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.900]   That is a lie.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.460]   God helps those who say, I can't help myself, God.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.100]   If I'm gonna get into eternal life
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:25:59.500]   or have a relationship with you,
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.980]   I will never, ever be good enough.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.540]   And if you think you're good enough,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.980]   you have bought the lie.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.780]   You'll never get there.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.540]   And God's not angry at that, he's in love with you,
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.940]   and so he decided from the beginning of time,
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.820]   I'm gonna give my son, because they'll never be able
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.260]   to make it, there's a gap between me and them
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.920]   and they'll never be able to cross it, I will give my son.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.660]   That's the message of the gospel.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.340]   And if you think, man, God helps those who help themselves,
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.620]   you have bought the lie.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.500]   You think that good people go to heaven
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.020]   and bad people go to hell, you have bought the biggest lies
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.520]   that relates to God out there.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.460]   It is forgiven people who go to heaven.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.860]   That's it.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.500]   And the only way to get forgiveness is through Jesus.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.160]   And so now, as Christians, Paul says, that's what we have.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.140]   We have this message of reconciliation.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.000]   We take it to the world, we take it to the streets,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.160]   we take it out there.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.000]   I know inside of this room, there's really like two camps
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.300]   as it relates to the Christians that are here.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.800]   There's world-changing Christians
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.960]   and then there's worldly Christians.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.800]   Same thing in Fort Worth, same thing in Houston,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.960]   same thing in Woodlands, there's world-changing,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.880]   like hey, we're gonna take this message,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.040]   this unique message the church has of reconciliation,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.540]   which how crucial is that right now in culture?
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.900]   That we have, we're gonna take it to this world
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.800]   and change it.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.300]   Or there's worldly Christians
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.140]   who are not changing the world,
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.340]   you're being changed by the world.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.380]   I mean, let's just be honest.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.780]   I mean, you were like, yeah, I'm here to be minister
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.940]   and if people talk about their faith,
[00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.300]   I don't wanna, I'm not too religious
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.860]   and just not too into it, but I wanna be kind
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.780]   to people at work and I'm gonna go to happy hour
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.180]   and hang out and kind of be on mission
[00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.520]   and now you're just getting buzzed at happy hour
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.600]   and you're going home buzzed
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.440]   and then all of a sudden you stop going home buzzed,
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.740]   you start going home with her or with him
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.200]   and you're not changing the world,
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.560]   you're being changed by it.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.600]   And Christ, there's so much more for you,
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.360]   you're missing out on your purpose.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.320]   What more tragic thing is there?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.840]   At the end of your days, at the end of my days
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.040]   for me to say, man, I miss my purpose
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:19.660]   and Christ and Paul in this letter says,
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.700]   don't miss it, you've been placed here for a reason.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.820]   That he's called all of us, if you're a Christian,
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.660]   I don't even know if such a thing as worldly Christians
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.940]   exist, to be honest, that as a Christian,
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.240]   you and I are called to be those who change this world.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.420]   The message of, or the mission statement of the porch
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.740]   and I'm about to land the plane,
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.740]   we're about to close it out tonight,
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.740]   the mission statement of the porch,
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.060]   a few years ago our team sat down,
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.820]   we brainstormed, hey, what's the mission,
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.340]   what's the purpose for which we exist
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.740]   and what we came up with, JP threw out an idea
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.820]   for a sentence and essentially it may have gotten
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.660]   massaged a little bit but it was pretty much this,
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.140]   it was surrender to God, we are changing the world
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.380]   through the lives of young adults.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.220]   What are we gonna do?
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.860]   Hey, what are we gonna do in Dallas and Fort Worth
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.300]   and Houston and Woodlands, every single place
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.020]   that we gather, we are gonna change the world
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:06.860]   through the lives of young adults.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.020]   Surrender to God, we're gonna be dependent on you, God.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.340]   Whatever you call us to do, we wanna be obedient to that.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.100]   We need you, we cannot do this on our own.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.780]   If we try to do, minister on our own,
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.660]   we make it about us, we know it will not succeed.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.180]   We know that, and if it does succeed and it gets big,
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.320]   or numbers happen, but it's not for Jesus, what's the point?
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.660]   Surrender to God, will you help us, Lord,
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.500]   to change the world and we are changing the world
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.740]   through the lives of young adults.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.140]   We grabbed onto that mission statement
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.740]   and honestly, it's been behind every single thing
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.580]   that we do.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.000]   It's really the purpose that is to be behind everything
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.300]   that all Christians do.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.860]   This is why this year, past Unashamed,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.000]   we do this thing called Unashamed, which is this weekend,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.060]   where we go out inside of the city of Dallas
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.620]   and what drives us is to change the world
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.820]   because the love of Christ is behind or compels us to do.
[00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.260]   So volunteers, hundreds of them this year.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.900]   Man, if you are not, if you didn't go on Unashamed
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.220]   or you don't even get to experience living out your faith
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.500]   on a daily basis, you are missing out if you're a Christian.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.780]   If you're like, man, I work too much,
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:11.980]   I work too many hours, you are missing out.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.980]   Unashamed is this three-day in-town mission trip
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.020]   where we all come together.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.700]   Hundreds of young adults went through it this week
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:17.920]   or through this past year.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.380]   They come together, three days inside of the city of Dallas,
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.660]   they go around sharing their faith in restaurants,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.860]   in streets, in South Dallas, all over the town.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.100]   They go around, why?
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.860]   Because the love of Christ compels them.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.060]   They believe that everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.420]   We've been given this message to reconcile the world.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.260]   Can we go around, have you heard of Jesus?
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.300]   Do you have a faith?
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.420]   Do you have a relationship?
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.720]   This is why Awaken, once a month, a church or our church,
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.420]   does this event called Awaken, which is in Clyde Warren Park,
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.460]   which is in the center of Dallas.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.580]   And we go downtown, we have a worship service.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.420]   Shanes will be there from time to time,
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.820]   different worship leaders will come,
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.420]   and we'll just perform worship in Clyde Warren Park.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.620]   We have to pay for it because Clyde Warren's like,
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.780]   this is too big of a group, we're gonna charge you for it.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.140]   And we're like, we're just hanging out.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.020]   And they're like, well, sorry, we'd like to make a buck.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.540]   And so we have to pay, but the reason why we pay
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.820]   is because the love of Christ compels us.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.140]   We're trying to get the message to the streets of Dallas
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.800]   that there is a God, and how many people inside us,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.560]   if 70% of Americans have bought the idea
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.020]   that man, God wants me to work my way to him,
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.360]   we wanna make sure that we use any megaphone we have
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:21.520]   to get the word out in the streets of Dallas
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.000]   and in Fort Worth and in Houston, that God has made a way.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.600]   And it's not through you earning and being a good person.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.960]   He killed and murdered his son because he loves you,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.940]   and he loves me.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.960]   And he doesn't want you to spend the rest of your life
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.080]   trying to earn your way to him.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.240]   So we take that message to the streets.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.000]   This is why hundreds of volunteers in Fort Worth
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.500]   and in Dallas gather every single week.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.400]   The porch is put on, the message and the music
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.360]   is a very small piece.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.600]   There's hundreds of volunteers.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.760]   They're the most gifted, incredible volunteers
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.120]   of any ministry at Watermark,
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.840]   and they put on the porch every single week.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.280]   The things that they do are unbelievable.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.120]   Why?
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.400]   Because the love of Christ compels them.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.360]   The food trucks that are here every week, they call 'em.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.220]   The events that are out there partying.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.860]   I don't know any of the events that are going on.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.700]   Neither does JP.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.760]   We have no idea what's going on.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.200]   We have amazing volunteers who said,
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.100]   "I'm gonna give my life to see Christ made more famous
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.080]   "inside of this city on every campus,
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.820]   "in every cubicle, in every classroom, at every place.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.960]   "I wanna see people come to know Jesus."
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.440]   'Cause everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.720]   That's what the volunteers who do.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.680]   In Fort Worth, they do the exact same thing
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.960]   where they've given up their time,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.160]   they've given up their lives to say,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.600]   "I wanna see Jesus made more famous."
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.780]   In the woodlands, you know how the woodlands started?
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.500]   The woodlands right now is being led by Chris.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.600]   Chris is a guy who has another full-time job.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.360]   Like he's not like, "Yeah, I'm just a young and old
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.200]   "church pastor."
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.640]   He's like, "Dude, I have a job,
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   "but I'm gonna give my nights in order to see Jesus
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.760]   "made more famous in this city."
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.480]   Somebody's gotta reach the hundreds of thousands
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.320]   of people in the woodlands.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.360]   And so Lord, maybe that's through us.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.120]   Will you help us to know how we can best do that?
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.080]   And he's experiencing his purpose.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.160]   Are you?
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.760]   The same thing in Houston where Josh
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.200]   and his incredible team of volunteers
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.380]   is giving their lives by vocational,
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.080]   which means they have a full-time job
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.280]   and they're like giving their life to serve.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.640]   And be a full-time volunteer, if you will, down there.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.480]   Why?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.920]   Because they believe that God is alive,
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.520]   eternity matters, and people's eternal lives
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.760]   are hinging on the church who takes the message
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.800]   of reconciliation out to the world.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.480]   And they've given themselves because the love
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.400]   of Christ compels you.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.700]   Is it driving you?
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.640]   Is the love of Christ compelling you?
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.440]   Are you a part of the mission that God's got the church on?
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.120]   And if not, you are missing out.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.400]   We were exchanging emails this week of just like,
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.820]   man, there's 600,000 young adults in Dallas.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:47.240]   600,000 around 25 to 29, 600,000.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.920]   And we were just praying, Lord, will you save 600,000
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.120]   young adults in this city through the ministry of the porch?
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.920]   And if you're going, man, this is all about numbers.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.600]   One, yes, we are all about reaching
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.880]   as many people as possible.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.420]   So if you're like, man, this is all about the numbers.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.260]   Yes, we are.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.100]   You know who else was?
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.160]   God and Jesus and Paul.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.360]   They were all about the numbers.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.800]   We don't care about them coming to the porch.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.920]   We care about them experiencing eternal life.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   So if that rubs you the wrong way, honestly,
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.400]   I don't think it rubs God the wrong way.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.720]   I don't think he's in heaven being like,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.280]   you believe this guy, Jesus?
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.240]   He's saying he wants 600 people, 600,000 people saved.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.140]   Unbelievable.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:28.320]   I think he's going, David, use bigger numbers.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.600]   I'm God.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.800]   Are you kidding me?
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.040]   I can do anything.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.460]   And we're not committed specifically to the porch.
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.380]   We're just saying, hey, whatever God's gonna do
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.020]   to reach people in this city for Christ,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.900]   we're not committed to a Tuesday gathering.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.300]   If there's a better way to reach people
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.900]   outside of these walls, we will shut down tomorrow
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.020]   and do that because we believe
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.100]   everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.900]   There's a purpose that he's created us for,
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.660]   and that's to extend the message to the world around us.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.480]   We're not perfect.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.460]   We are messed up, broken sinners.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.940]   Me at the top of the list.
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.860]   If you knew the thoughts that I had today,
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   you would not wanna be in here right now.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.740]   And if I knew the thoughts that you had today,
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.540]   we would not let you in here right now.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.980]   But we cling to Jesus and we point others to him.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.980]   Are you gonna be a part of that, whether that's here
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.460]   or wherever you are plugged in into a local church?
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.500]   If you're a Christian and you're not, you are missing out.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.180]   We are gonna take the college campuses
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.320]   that are represented in this room by storm.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.020]   With every breath inside of us,
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.140]   we're gonna see whatever we can do.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.260]   So if you are at DBU or UNT or you're at UTD
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.220]   or whatever school and campus you're on,
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.900]   we are gonna see to the best of our ability
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.780]   and pray that God will raise up men and women
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.100]   who will take that message all over that campus
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.300]   and infiltrate and flood it with the love of God
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.900]   because the love of Christ compels his people.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.180]   I'll close right here,
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.440]   and the band can come up and finish.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.460]   I know that just like with Amazon,
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.140]   there was, it's really like, if you're an Amazon Prime member
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.180]   there's three types of people in the room
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.020]   as it relates to Prime.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.580]   There's those who are going, yeah, hey,
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.100]   I have Amazon Prime, it's unbelievable.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.740]   Using the music, using the pictures, I know all the stuff.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.260]   I'm using all that I have, all that I have access to,
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.420]   taking advantage of it.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.620]   And then there's people who are like,
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.140]   oh, I just thought it was the shipping thing,
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.420]   kind of like I was.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.860]   Oh, this is cool, so there's music, interesting.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.960]   And then there's people who don't have that at all.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.780]   And in that same way,
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.900]   as it relates to the relationship with Christ
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.040]   inside of the room, there's really those three categories.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.580]   There's people who are going, look, I am all in.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.680]   I know what I have in Christ.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.760]   I experience the new point of view.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.180]   I know that my position, my status with God
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.640]   will never change.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.700]   There's nothing that I can do.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.420]   There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.820]   because God has done what the law or my obedience
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.380]   could not do by sending his own son for me.
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.780]   And dying in my place, I have freedom in Christ.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.740]   And when I blow it, I can freely confess that.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.300]   I can freely walk in the light.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.000]   But I don't have to wonder where I stand with God.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.540]   There's that person.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.640]   And then they're also experiencing their purpose,
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.820]   where they're living out their mission.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.660]   They're not chasing a bunch of trinkets.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.780]   That just like, remember when you were like
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.740]   in middle school and there was like gigapets
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.260]   or beanie babies and things that you like,
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.720]   spent your life, oh, these are so awesome.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.980]   You look back and you're like, man, that was so weird.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   Gigapets, man, that was really,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.500]   I lost like half of you on that thing.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.340]   Beanie babies, whatever it was, you look back,
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.380]   pogs or Pokemon, before there was the Pokemon Go.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.420]   Whenever you look back and you're like,
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.740]   man, why did I chase after that?
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.660]   That's so foolish.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.160]   There's gonna come a day where you're gonna see
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   from heaven's perspective, the heaven point of view
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.980]   that anything you've chased in this life was like that.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.620]   And then there's the type of person in the room
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.180]   who's saying, I'm all in with Jesus.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.660]   I'm experiencing my purpose.
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:58.980]   Then there's the type of person who's saying,
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.100]   I feel like I've trusted in Christ,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.900]   but I'm not experiencing my purpose.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.740]   I'm too busy, I've got too much going on.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.340]   I just don't care that much.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.540]   And you're missing out.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.720]   You're not just missing out in the Amazon thing
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.860]   of saving 30 cents.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   You're missing out on the reason you exist,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.420]   which is to know God and to make him known.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:25.060]   And then there's the person who doesn't have
[00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.700]   just like the Amazon account doesn't have it at all.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:34.540]   And tonight, God offers that, extends it to you freely
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.920]   if you will just accept it.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.360]   Just like if I was like, hey, tonight,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.740]   if you pull out your phones, I've got a promo code
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.860]   that I keep with me for Amazon Prime.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.820]   Thanks, Jeff.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.260]   I'm gonna give this to you, and if you don't have it,
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.980]   you can accept it for free tonight in the same way
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.140]   God has said.
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.860]   Regardless of what you've done,
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.500]   regardless of what you did today,
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.220]   regardless of what's in your past,
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.780]   whatever you're facing, whatever shame you feel,
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:04.780]   if you will accept it, my grace stands for you.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.820]   Eternal life, you don't have to wonder anymore.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.580]   You can have permanent status,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.540]   permanent relationship with me,
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.780]   permanently dealt with on the cross.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.300]   Every sin that you're going to commit,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.940]   every sin that's been committed,
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:22.860]   all of them offered freely if you'll just accept it.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:28.740]   And in doing that, you'll experience the freedom in Christ
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.760]   and step towards the purpose of your life.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.800]   Let me pray that that would happen.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.440]   Oh, Lord.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:51.460]   Father, would you save our city?
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.460]   Father, would you save Fort Worth?
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.660]   Would you stretch out your hand?
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:02.660]   The God of Paul,
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.820]   the God who raised our Savior Jesus from the dead,
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:09.540]   the God over all things,
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.220]   the God who made us, fashioned us,
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.700]   the God who knows everything we're facing.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.180]   Lord, will you stretch out your hand
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.180]   and will you save hundreds of thousands of young adults
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.460]   in this city, Lord?
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.220]   Would you strengthen your church, Father?
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.580]   Would you strengthen those in this room?
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.500]   Would you give them a vision for their lives?
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.620]   Would they dream dreams as big as you are, God?
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.920]   Would you do the same in my own heart and life?
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.180]   Father, thank you that you made a way
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.740]   that you don't require us to try harder and be better,
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.860]   but simply accept the free gift that you've given us,
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.420]   where you made Him, Jesus, our King,
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.700]   who knew no sin to become sin for me
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:54.820]   and for my friends in this room.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.380]   Would you stretch out your hand now
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.380]   and press on the hearts of friends who don't know you?
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.620]   Would they come to know you tonight,
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.220]   that tonight is their night?
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.340]   Would you stretch out your hand
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.220]   and press on the hearts of men and women
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.660]   who have known you for a while,
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.860]   but they have not been experiencing their purpose, Lord?
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.140]   Would that change?
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.820]   Would the city of Houston change?
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.340]   Would the woodlands change?
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.420]   In every city where the church gathers, Lord,
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.380]   in Dallas, may it be as it is in heaven,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.940]   and in Houston as it is in heaven,
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.460]   in the woodlands as it is in heaven,
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.300]   in every place where the church of Jesus Christ
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.420]   is in the full earth,
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.020]   Father, would you use us
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.220]   and do abundantly more than all we could ever ask and thank?
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.100]   Thank you that you use imperfect people
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.420]   who are broken and sinners like me
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.860]   and like my friends here.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.060]   The question is just, will we surrender?
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.740]   Surrender and seek your purpose.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.580]   We love you, amen.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:42:02.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
