00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Well, hello Porch, how we doing? Yeah, it's great to be with you. My name is Todd. I get to hang out with you guys periodically and hang around here all the time at Watermark. It's awesome to be here.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And I'm going to tell you a story about a friend and he's got a question for you. True story. I've got a friend who's very powerful.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 This particular friend was a good guy for a long time, but one day, man, you know how it is, he just laid his eyes on something he couldn't keep his eyes off of.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And he kept looking at it and he kept liking it and eventually he tapped into it. And not just a little bit, but all the way. Just one time.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And he thinks that she's pregnant.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Even worse, this deal with my friend is that it was not just the friend of a friend of his, it was the wife of a friend of his.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And he comes to me and he says, "What are my options if she's pregnant?"

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I'm asking for a friend. I mean, here it is. I was just getting along and having a good time with a girl and all of a sudden we get out just one time, but a good time for a long time and then we get this.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I'm asking for a friend.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 What do you do if you're pregnant, man? What are your options? What can I do now? Let me just go on and tell you something about this friend. True story.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 This friend was powerful. I told you that. And so what he did is he decided to try and cover up the mistake he made this one time with his friend's wife.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And so he invited the friend home. The friend was away doing business for him. The friend worked for him.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 He brought the friend back home thinking that bringing the friend back home would cause the friend who'd been away for a while to sleep with his wife.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And then maybe when he worked forward 9-10 months, he would figure out that the child was his and it would all go away and it would be just his little secret and the wife's secret.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And he was going to let it go away, but here's the thing. When his friend came home, where his friend came back from, he had left some other friends.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 He was called home on a special envoy by this friend of mine to come back. And when the friend came back, he was honorable and said, "I'm not going to enjoy the benefits with my wife this short time when I'm home.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'm going to be all about business so he didn't sleep with his wife. And so my friend's got a problem." And he wants to know what are his options because she's pregnant.

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 What he actually did is he decided to do something crazy. He sent this friend to his back. I didn't tell you this yet, but what his friend was was a warrior, like a Navy SEAL.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Think like a Navy SEAL. He was a Navy SEAL. And because he was powerful, he put this guy in a position where he knew that probably in the mission that he was on, he wouldn't survive.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 True story. And his friend, whose wife he had slept with one time and she got pregnant, died.

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He, in effect, murdered his friend. Because as he tried to figure out what he should do, and he was thinking through his options, he thought, "I can't tell my friend I slept with this gal. I can't tell the world that this girl's pregnant by me.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So what I'm going to do is set this person up and I'm basically going to murder this person. That's what I'm going to do because this person, I didn't mean to get pregnant, got pregnant. I think my option is to eliminate my problem."

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Now how many of you all want to live in a land with a person like that, who because it was more convenient for them, because it was powerful, they were powerful and able to do this, that the way they dealt with their problem that was a major inconvenience was to commit murder?

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Anybody want to live in a land like that? I know I don't.

26
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 There's a law, actually not a law, there's a change that was made in our society.

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Back in 1776, we conducted a great experiment. The experiment was could people live together in what is called a democratic republic? In other words, no longer was the king going to be law. It's called Rex Lex, where Rex, the king, is Lex, law.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 The king is the law. He's got all the power. He can make all the laws.

29
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 We came back and we said no. In fact, we took from something called the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta was a great document and it challenged Rex Lex and it said no, Lex, Rex.

30
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 The law is actually king. There is a right that even the king should have to live this way.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But see, sometimes powerful people don't like to live ways they don't want to live, especially when they've got problems they don't want to have and they've got the power to do something about them and they like Rex Lex.

32
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I'm asking for a friend. She's pregnant. What are my options?

33
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Now listen, my friend didn't talk to me about this particular problem before he made the decision to commit murder on his buddy so there would be no problem as he moved into a more permanent relationship with his ex-friend's ex-wife.

34
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But I think all of you guys have listened to this story and you go, "That's crazy. You said that story is true." Yeah, the story is true. It's the story of a guy named David. He was king.

35
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And he laid eyes on Bathsheba, who was the wife of his good friend Uriah, who was one of his mighty men, the navy seals of his day.

36
00:05:43,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And when David didn't know what to do and he found out that somebody that he didn't mean to get pregnant was pregnant, the king just did what he wanted because he could, because there was something in the way, something costly, something bothersome, something he was powerful over, and he decided to commit murder to deal with this problem.

37
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Well, what are you going to do when your friend comes to you? They're in a sense king. Maybe your friend's a girl. It doesn't matter. She's queen. And she can decide what she wants to do. I mean, I'm pregnant. What do I do?

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So here's what I would say to my friend. What are you pregnant with?

39
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I mean, what are you pregnant with? Let's just start with that because depending on what you're pregnant with, we may or may not have a problem.

40
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Are you pregnant with a mouse? Are you pregnant with a gerbil? Are you pregnant with a panda? Now, some people might have a problem with that if you mess with that panda.

41
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 But what is it that you're pregnant with? Because let me just tell you something. I'm a dad, and every now and then people ask questions, and before you answer the question I ask of you, you want to get a little bit more information.

42
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So I've been in this situation where I'm in one room, I can't see what's going on in another room, and all of a sudden I go, "Ahh! Dad, can I kill this?"

43
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Now listen, before I answer that question, what do I need to do? I need to go, "Well, what is it that you want to kill?"

44
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Is it a cockroach? Yeah, I'm going to step on that thing, kill it.

45
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Is it the neighbor's dog? Mmm, all right.

46
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Is it your brother? Let's definitely come in here. What is it that you want to kill?

47
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Because once you determine what it is that you want to kill, then we've got some answers, and we know kind of which direction to go.

48
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And we know what your options are if you're pregnant.

49
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Let me just talk about this as we get going a little bit further, because there are certain things that we all like, and there are certain things that we all respect when we see things in other people.

50
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And so in addition to asking you, "What is it that you're pregnant with?"

51
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 By the way, so what's the mother of the baby? Well, it's a human. What's the father of the baby? It's a human.

52
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Well, throughout history, we're pretty sure that creatures create after their kind, so probably what she's pregnant with is, in fact, a human.

53
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And that something is alive. If it wasn't alive, we wouldn't need to deal with it, because it's not a problem.

54
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 No, something is growing in you. It's alive. That's the problem that we're trying to deal with if we're looking at this as a problem instead of possibly an opportunity.

55
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 An opportunity to do what, you might say? Well, an opportunity to do the things that we always see people do that makes us respect them.

56
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Have you ever thought about what it is that makes you look at somebody and go, "I admire that person"?

57
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I had a friend of mine who actually had a chance to speak to a bunch of folks about a topic related to what I'm talking to you about tonight, where she's basically making a case for her friends that human life matters.

58
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And one of the things that she said was just basically this. She said, "There's really three things I always see in other people that make me respect them and admire them.

59
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Number one, they inspire me when I see people put others ahead of themselves. And when I see people do that, it makes me really admire them."

60
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 She used a great example. She talked about in 2009, there was a captain of a ship called the Costa Concordia.

61
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I don't know if you guys remember this or not, but he was the captain of a cruise ship.

62
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And this cruise ship got a little bit too close to land, and it tipped over. And a bunch of people actually died.

63
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 That's not why the story made the news, because this cruise ship tipped and a bunch of people died.

64
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It made the news because the captain of the Costa Concordia in 2009 said when the ship tipped, he fell out of the boat into a lifeboat, and that's why he abandoned ship.

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 He was later court-martialed. And he was villainized universally. Why?

66
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Because there were people dependent upon him, folks that were under, if you will, his care, and he abandoned them, and he left them.

67
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And he didn't inspire anybody. He was villainized and charged and prosecuted.

68
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Three years later, there was a guy that was flying a U.S. Airways flight, took off from LaGuardia. You remember this story?

69
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 A flock of geese jumped into one of the jet engines and shut this sucker down.

70
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And Captain Sullenberger saw that he was losing power in both engines. He couldn't make it back to LaGuardia or any other near airport, so he said, "I'm not going to do anything but try and land this thing."

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And he landed that plane safely onto Hudson.

72
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And when he got there on that Hudson, what happened is that people in the back didn't realize that the tail was submerged, so somebody opened that exit gate in the rear of the plane, and water began to flood the plane that he had miraculously—it's called the miracle of the Hudson—it miraculously landed safely.

73
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And people then started all running towards the middle and the front where the two exit doors were there, except one person.

74
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Captain Sullenberger made his way to the back. He made his way all the way to the back and made sure everybody got out the middle and the front.

75
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And he made two laps up and down, water waist-high, checking every seat to make sure everybody was out.

76
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And Tom Hanks made a movie about this hero, and it inspires us when we see somebody who looks at others in their care and they put those others ahead of themselves.

77
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Doesn't that inspire you?

78
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Secondly, we look at folks and they've got a perspective, that they realize that the issue that they're dealing with right now isn't the end of the world, and so they don't make impulsive, dramatic decisions.

79
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 They don't add one problem to another problem. They're prudent, they're careful, and they're wise, and they stop and they slow down.

80
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 You know, one of the options that you have when somebody gets pregnant is to say, "I'm going to do the noble thing, right? I'm going to make them mine.

81
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I'm going to take them under my wing. I'm going to offer to be their husband." That may not be the wise thing to do. It's an option.

82
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 But if you've got two people that are reckless, that are prone to do what they want to do when they want to do it, who live in rebellion against God consistently to try and then move them together in a marriage where those two people have never learned to love,

83
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 but have always been used to doing what they want to do when they want to do it, which is partly how they got where they are in the first place, then it may not be wise for them to get married.

84
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 It is an option that you can marry that person that you got pregnant, or if you are the pregnant person, that you can marry the person that impregnated you.

85
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But that may not be the wisest thing to do.

86
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And I'm inspired by people that have perspective, that can see outside the moment, that are individuals that are careful, not hasty and impulsive.

87
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I'm inspired by people who do the right thing even when it's hard.

88
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I'm asking for a friend, man.

89
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 She's pregnant.

90
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 What are my options?

91
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Let's walk back through some of this again.

92
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Let me just start by just asking you, what is it that we're pregnant with?

93
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 What's going on inside of you right now?

94
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because if what is growing inside of you is not a human being, then no justification for what you might consider as an option, let's just call it abortion.

95
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 That's what it is.

96
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 No decision to abort something that is not a human is really a problem.

97
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Like I said, if it's a panda, you know, the Chinese are going to be ticked off.

98
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 You guys, why did you say that?

99
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Well, because you know that every panda in the world is owned by the Chinese.

100
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Do you know that?

101
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And they lease them out to zoos all around the world at a million bucks a year.

102
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 So, the Chinese might be ticked off if you're going to abort a panda.

103
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But what is it that she's pregnant with?

104
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 If what is growing inside of her is not a human person, then no justification for abortion is necessary.

105
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 If it's just tissue, then it's no problem.

106
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 But if it's a human being that she's pregnant with, then no justification is adequate.

107
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And you have a situation right here where you've got to have a little perspective.

108
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 You want to add one problem to another.

109
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 You want to be noble.

110
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 You want to do the right thing.

111
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 You want to add to your mistakes.

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 My friend, quote unquote, David, made a mistake.

113
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 He added to the mistake murder.

114
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And when I told you that story, every single person said, "Man, why in the world would you do that?"

115
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And let me just be very tender here.

116
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I just want to say this as we go forward.

117
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I want to be really compassionate towards you tonight because some people want to say,

118
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 "Man, Todd, when you talk about abortion and you mention the word murder, man, don't you know that according to people who study this,

119
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 that one out of every three women alive will have an abortion one day, that one out of four women alive today under 45 have already had one?"

120
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 She got pregnant.

121
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 There was some problem, man.

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And now she's done this and you just equated that with murder?

123
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Is that what you just did?

124
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Is that kind of how you told the David story and worked it back around that she was pregnant and didn't know what to do and thought his option was murder?

125
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And now you're dragging that from your riot and what David did, which we all thought was wrong, to what that mom just did?

126
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Let me just say something.

127
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Some people would say, "Man, you can't talk like that.

128
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And you can't talk about it that way because you've got to protect people from guilt and pain."

129
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And what I want to say to you is I'm not trying to create guilt and pain in you.

130
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I don't want to shield you from unnecessary pain as much as I want to keep you from that which you need to understand, which will bring about necessary healing.

131
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Until you understand what you may have been a part of or might be about to be a part of, you can't feel bad about it, you can't deal with it, or you're going to feel it for a long time.

132
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 But you may not feel it the way you need to if you keep telling yourself it's something that it's not.

133
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Let's just be clear.

134
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 If it's just a clump of cells, then we don't have a problem.

135
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Day one.

136
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 The moment that a sperm fertilizes an egg, at that particular moment, every chromosome, all the DNA, everything that will be present in that human when they are 80 years old is present immediately after that conception happens.

137
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 It is unique human life at the moment of conception.

138
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Let me just say this.

139
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 One of the things that we know is that sometimes when people can't get pregnant, they go to a life specialist, an in vitro fertilizing professional, who is going to sit there and try and figure out when they have something they can implant inside of you that will lead to a human being.

140
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 What is that thing?

141
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 That thing is a fertilized egg, and they don't say, "We're not really sure if it's going to be three weeks before it has a heartbeat or six weeks before it has a full sense of touch and brain waves and its mouth and lips are there and fingers are there, or at 17 weeks it's got a sense of hearing and memory."

142
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 No.

143
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 They know they have a human life the second there is a fertilized egg.

144
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 It's human life.

145
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 They go, "Now we can implant that in you, and if it is cared for and protected, it will lead to a human life."

146
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 We know when life begins.

147
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 It's not just a clump of cells.

148
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Or should I say it this way?

149
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It is a clump of cells just like you and I are a clump of cells.

150
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 That's what a human being is.

151
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It is an ordered assembly of cells.

152
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 You might say, "Well, Todd, man, that newborn baby doesn't look very much like a human."

153
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I'm going to tell you, that fertilized egg looks exactly like every human ever looked exactly at that human's age of development.

154
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Man, she's pregnant.

155
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 What are my options?

156
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 What is she pregnant with?

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Sometimes when folks are talking about this topic, they just say, "Well, look, man, there's a couple of things that are necessary for you to really have a sense of responsibility towards that."

158
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Because I'm not really sure.

159
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Okay, so it's a human being, but it's not a human person.

160
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And because it's not a person, it doesn't get all the rights that persons should get.

161
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 And I go, "Well, what makes you say it's not a person?"

162
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I've already talked about one of them.

163
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 They go, "Well, it doesn't look like a human."

164
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I say, "No, no, it looks like every human looked at that particular age of development."

165
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 A four-year-old doesn't look like a 40-year-old.

166
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But we all agree a four-year-old is just a 40-year-old at a different life stage.

167
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It is a human being, and it is filled with dignity and value, and it is worth protecting because it's a human person.

168
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 It's the same thing true when it's a zygote or an embryo or a fetus.

169
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Fetus just literally means in Latin that which is brought forth.

170
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Embryo just means fruit of the womb.

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 It's just words that we use, and the reason we sometimes use words is because we want to protect people from guilt and shame.

172
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And what I'm going to tell you is I don't want people to feel guilt and shame, but I also don't want to protect them from that which is going to bring them necessary healing.

173
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 And until you know what you've done, until you know that there's a problem, you cannot deal with the problem and move towards a solution.

174
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Blessed are the poor in spirit.

175
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 People who understand what they've been a part of and understand what they've been doing.

176
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 It helps clarify what your options are.

177
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Some would say it's not a person because of its size. Let's just talk about that.

178
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 In fact, I want to give you a little acronym.

179
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's a simple way for you to remember when you're talking to a friend who says, "Man, I think she's pregnant," or "Hey, I think I'm pregnant. What are my options?"

180
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 You want to think about sled. You just give it the sled test.

181
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 People go, "Well, it's not probably a person because of its size. It's not as big. It doesn't look like."

182
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 I've already talked about that. It looks exactly like every human being looks like at that particular part.

183
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 By the way, a newborn doesn't look like a toddler. A toddler doesn't look like a child. A child doesn't look like a teenager.

184
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 A teenager doesn't look like somebody who's 50.

185
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The size of something does not determine its personhood.

186
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 100% of the genetic information that exists in me was present when I was a zygote.

187
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Size does not determine dignity and value.

188
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Some people would say, "Well, not just size, okay, because we think a two-year-old is as valuable as a four-year-old.

189
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 What about the level of development?"

190
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 In fact, there are people, a guy named Peter Singer, who is a philosophy professor at Princeton,

191
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 makes the case that we shouldn't give any dignity to somebody unless they're rational, conscious, and self-aware.

192
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 In fact, he believes in what's called "Iphanticide."

193
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Up until several years of age, you should be able to make a decision about whether you want to keep a child.

194
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And frankly, he's more consistent than many other people who, because they hide behind certain languages and certain terms,

195
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 think there are more options with what you should say or what you might consider when you find out that she might be pregnant.

196
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I'm asking for a friend.

197
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Peter Singer says, "I don't care if she's pregnant. I don't care if the baby was born."

198
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Until that baby is rational, conscious, and self-aware, it isn't a dignified human person.

199
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I want you to think about that.

200
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 When you start to talk about something that is small, and at the moment that the one-celled human embryo begins to exist,

201
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 it doesn't have an organ that allows it to think.

202
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I've mentioned to you that that sense of memory or the brain isn't really developed until about six weeks.

203
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So those first six weeks, if you're lucky enough to find out that you're pregnant during those six weeks,

204
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 you might think, "Well, it's not a human yet."

205
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 I would tell you it's completely human, and everything that is there, that will be there when that human is 80, is there right then.

206
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 It just hasn't developed.

207
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Now, it's different than an amoeba.

208
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 An amoeba isn't something that will ever be rational, conscious, or self-aware because of what it is,

209
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 not because of how old it is.

210
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Children are not rational.

211
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Children are not often self-aware.

212
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Children aren't conscious of their surroundings.

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Two-year-olds are people that still, in their level of development, have not yet developed all the things that we have when we walk in this room tonight.

214
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And yet, nobody in this room would side with Peter Singer.

215
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And yet, Peter Singer, in many ways, is scientifically more consistent, although he's philosophically way off base.

216
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Peter Singer says, "I'll tell you what your options are, not just up until that child is born,

217
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 but I'll tell you what your options are up until we think that child is rational and conscious and self-aware."

218
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Size doesn't determine dignity.

219
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Level of development doesn't determine dignity.

220
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And environment doesn't determine dignity.

221
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 They would say, "Well, it's not really human because that human lives inside of the mother.

222
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's in the wrong location."

223
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We don't think that somebody becomes less human when they leave the Earth's atmosphere and go into orbit.

224
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 We don't think somebody becomes less human when they put on scuba gear and go underwater.

225
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 We go, "No, it's still a human, even though it's in a different environment."

226
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Environment doesn't determine whether or not somebody is human.

227
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Then what about this one, Tyler?

228
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 What about degree of dependency?

229
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That child is dependent.

230
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 In fact, one of the things that I would say is that we look at, and go back to our example of Captain Sullenberger,

231
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 is the more that something is dependent, the more something is needy, the more something requires care and attention,

232
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 the more we put responsibilities on the individual who is stewarded the care of that individual.

233
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 If a mother decides to go to the roller skating party on Thursday night and she leaves a six-month person at home alone,

234
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 there's going to be a different response from our government than if she leaves to go to a roller skating party on Thursday night

235
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 and she leaves an 18-year-old at home.

236
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The greater the level of dependency or the degree of dependency that's in somebody,

237
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 what should be more true is the greater the care that we give to them should be.

238
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Some people go, "Well, Todd, you can say all this, all that you want, but I am king.

239
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 I believe in a woman's right to choose, so I've got options."

240
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 All I would say when somebody says that, "I believe in a woman's right to choose,"

241
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 that's just kind of a statement that needs to be finished.

242
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 What do you mean you believe in a woman's right to choose?

243
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It's not even a sentence.

244
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 You believe in a woman's right to choose what?

245
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Her nail color? I'm all in.

246
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 What job she wants? I'm all in.

247
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 What she wants to spend $800 for and call a purse? I'm all in.

248
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 A woman has a right to choose.

249
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 She can do whatever she wants, but does a woman have a right to choose to kill her six-month-old?

250
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Does she have a right to kill a baby that makes her uncomfortable or costs too much or disrupts the life she always dreamed of?

251
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I might say to you, "Would you believe in a right of a man to take?"

252
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Take what? Take a chance?

253
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Take his dog to the park? Take a nap?

254
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Sure.

255
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Do you believe in a man's right to take a woman's dignity?

256
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Do you believe Harvey Weinstein had the right to take?

257
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Me too, neither.

258
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Finish your sentence.

259
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 We don't believe that people have a right to choose anything they want to choose.

260
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 "Well, hey, I wouldn't choose that, but I'm going to let her choose that."

261
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Really? Let me ask you a question.

262
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 What would you do if somebody came to you and said they were going to rape somebody else?

263
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I know you wouldn't rape somebody, but what if somebody was going to rape somebody else?

264
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Would you go, "I'm going to do everything I can to keep them from doing it"?

265
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Yeah. Would you say that if they go ahead and do it, that there are going to be laws in place to keep them from doing it again?

266
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 There are going to be consequences and significant ones?

267
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You bet you would.

268
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The same thing is true if you might not take someone's life,

269
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 and you just don't think you should let somebody else.

270
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 There should be laws in place.

271
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 The question is, what is she pregnant with?

272
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 See, at the end of the day, you've got to realize that this topic that we're talking about,

273
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 your view on abortion, is not just a personal choice you're making about a child.

274
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It's a declaration you're making about who is your God.

275
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I'm not talking about Bible verses that talk about the dignity of human life.

276
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I'm not talking about Bible verses that talk about that God knows us in our womb,

277
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and He's seen us from the moment that we were conceived.

278
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I'm talking about what you're going to say at that particular moment, "I don't really care about that child.

279
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I don't really care about anybody but me.

280
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 So what are my options because I'm going to choose what I want to choose?"

281
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Listen, we don't let people kill people for all the reasons that are always offered

282
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 when we talk about this thing called abortion.

283
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 We don't let people kill people because they're in the way, they're costly, it's a privacy issue.

284
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I've got a right to my own body.

285
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

286
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

287
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

288
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

289
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

290
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

291
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I've got a right to my own life.

292
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I'm talking seriously about significantly increasing the consequences of men who rape women.

293
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But do you believe we should kill a child because of the sin of the father?

294
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 What is the rape victim pregnant with?

295
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 What inspires you?

296
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 What inspires me are people that put others ahead of themselves, that have perspective

297
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 and that do the right thing even when it's hard.

298
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So if you're asking for a friend, what do you do?

299
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 You've got to think about what it is.

300
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Now let me just take just a moment and I'm going to show you some hard stuff.

301
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And I'm not going to show you some hard stuff because I want to, again,

302
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 have you experience unnecessary pain, but because I want to keep you from missing out on necessary healing.

303
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I want to keep you from being persuaded by stories and questions and illustrations that aren't true.

304
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 There have always been human rights atrocities.

305
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Here's a picture of two of the more well-known ones of a person that because of his color and race

306
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 was treated as chattel, was treated as somebody that he wasn't owned.

307
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Actually, I want to show the slide of the three people up here first.

308
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 The African-American slave, the victim of the Nazi Holocaust, and then you're also going to see the child in the womb.

309
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 There's always been victims of human rights offenses.

310
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And the reason that they've been victims, it'll come up in just a moment,

311
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 is because of the way that they were described.

312
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 They were seen as less than human.

313
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 They were whipped. They were imprisoned because of their ethnicity, their color, their race,

314
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 or their stage of development, or how they were viewed as a person.

315
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Every human right injustice that's ever happened dehumanizes the innocent victim and says,

316
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 "That's not a human. They're not human. It's not human. What are our options?"

317
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 The picture that was up here a little bit ago was of a young man whose name is Emmett Till.

318
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Emmett Till actually just was exhumed and had his casket moved to the African-American Smithsonian Museum in D.C.

319
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 The reason it did is because Emmett Till became a very famous individual in 1955 in a way that wasn't at all glamorous.

320
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Emmett Till was from Chicago. He went down to visit some relatives in Dixie.

321
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 When he was down there, there was a woman, Carolyn Bryant, who accused him of wolf-whistling her,

322
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 grabbing her aggressively, and actually thrusting himself upon her.

323
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 She later denied that that ever happened.

324
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 But her husband, Roy Bryant, and his buddy, J.W. Milliam, took him that night and beat him to death,

325
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 threw him in the Tallahatchie River, tied him with barbed wire to a cotton gin fan,

326
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 and threw him in the river and left him there to decompose.

327
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It took several days for them to find him.

328
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 When they found him, they took his body, and they sent his body back to Chicago.

329
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 His mother, Mammy Till, decided to have an open casket funeral.

330
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Now, brace yourself.

331
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 In 1955, Jet Magazine went ahead and ran this picture I'm about to show you of Emmett Till

332
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 because she wanted to awaken the nation to the horrors of dehumanizing somebody

333
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 simply because of somebody else not thinking they're valuable.

334
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 This is the picture of Emmett Till that began to change the consciousness of America.

335
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Both eyes were gouged out. There was a bullet hole to the head.

336
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 He was severely beaten and left dead.

337
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 She just said, "You need to realize that this is what they're doing to people

338
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 because they put them in a category that they say those people don't matter."

339
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I'm going to show you in just a second very quickly some pictures

340
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 because pictures communicate truth.

341
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Your buddy comes to you and says, "I think I might be pregnant."

342
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Your girlfriend comes to you and you go, "I think I might be pregnant. What are my options?"

343
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 You've got to ask yourself, "What are you pregnant with, sweetie?"

344
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Because if it's a human life, I don't care how costly it is for you to bear it.

345
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I don't really care how much it's going to be in the way of your perfect plans.

346
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 I don't care what you think about what it reminds you of.

347
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 I don't care about your privacy issue. I don't care about what you want.

348
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I don't care about the tragic beginning. Have some perspective.

349
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Because what's being aborted is a human life.

350
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Now listen, if you are not comfortable with certain images, I don't put these up to shock you.

351
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 I put these up to teach you just like Mamie Till did.

352
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 I'm going to put up five images in five seconds and they're going to fly by.

353
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 This is what's being aborted. It's a precious human person.

354
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 What are my options?

355
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Your options are to be heroic. Your options are not to make another problem.

356
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Your options aren't to say, "Rex, Lex, baby, I'm king."

357
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Your options are to really acknowledge that maybe you've been a part of something that you never thought you'd want to be a part of.

358
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 See, because some of you in this room, I know you've made a decision already to terminate the pregnancy.

359
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And the moment you did, you became un-pregnant, but you know every single year when that child's birthday would be.

360
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 You look at other kids and you go, "That child's about six. That's how old my child would be."

361
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 You became un-pregnant, but you're not an un-mom.

362
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And you know that.

363
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And you carry that weight around with you, and I don't want you to carry that weight around anymore.

364
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And I want you to know something.

365
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 There's a God who loves you.

366
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 He's not mad at you.

367
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And he wants to heal you.

368
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 There's a verse in Isaiah chapter 49 that says this, "But Zion," that's the name for Israel,

369
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 "the people that God loves, says, 'The Lord has forsaken me. The Lord's forgotten me.'"

370
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And then Isaiah the prophet says this, "Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion on the son of her womb?"

371
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Isaiah says, "Oh, yeah."

372
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Almost 60 million Americans have since 1973.

373
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Hundreds of women in this room, hundreds of men in this room have been a part of forgetting the precious unborn human person

374
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 that they were given stewardship over.

375
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Moms can forget. Dads can forget.

376
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 They can find convenient words and convenient reasons to maybe deal with it in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

377
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 But we need to realize exactly what's going on here.

378
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Yeah, these may forget, but this is what God says, "I won't forget you."

379
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 "Behold," verse 16 says, "I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands."

380
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The things that are hindering you, the troubles, the protection you need, they're continually before me.

381
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And I love you.

382
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 I want you to know this. Proverbs 28, 13 says this, "That he who conceals his transgressions will not prosper."

383
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 You may think that this is a secret you can take with you and that you can go forward with,

384
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 but he who conceals his transgressions will not prosper.

385
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 But he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion.

386
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 I'm going to give you a testimony from my friend David,

387
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 the one who didn't seek good counsel when he found out that she was pregnant

388
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 and ended up participating in a murder.

389
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 This is what he says in Psalm 32.

390
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 He says, "How blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.

391
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 How blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute,"

392
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 which means just to put upon, to place upon their sin,

393
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 "and whose spirit there is no deceit. How blessed is that man."

394
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 He says, "That's not me. I know exactly what I did.

395
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Even though I'm king, even though I can cover it up, I can't cover it up inside of me.

396
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 I carry the weight of my decision with me.

397
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And when I kept silent," verse 3, "about my sin, my body wasted away

398
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 through my groaning all day long.

399
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me, the hand of his conscience, the hand of God.

400
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer."

401
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And he just rests. And he sits in that pain.

402
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 But he said, "Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and my iniquity I did not hide."

403
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 I said, "I'm going to confess my transgressions to the Lord,

404
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 and you forgave the guilt of my sin."

405
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 That's what God wants you to hear tonight.

406
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Listen, we all make decisions without perspective.

407
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 We've all rebelled against God.

408
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 All of us like sheep have gone astray, and hundreds of us in this room

409
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 have made a decision to deal with an unwanted pregnancy in a way that we look back

410
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and we just go, "You know, I just didn't have perspective.

411
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I can't ever tell anybody that, even though I never really stopped thinking about that."

412
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 And you have a God who is here who's telling you, "Tell me.

413
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Tell me you know exactly what you did.

414
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Tell me you know that all the rhetoric and all the language that you've used

415
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 and you were told about it being safe, that it's not safe.

416
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 And that you carry it with you everywhere you go, and that you need forgiveness."

417
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 This is what he says, "Therefore, let everyone," in verse 6,

418
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 "who has godly prayed to you in a time when you may be found surely in a flood of great waters,

419
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 you will not reach him."

420
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Oh, David says, "You're my hiding place.

421
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 You preserve me from trouble.

422
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 You surround me with the songs of deliverance."

423
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 That's why we sing these songs.

424
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 We want you to know it doesn't matter what you've done.

425
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 There's a God who wants to forgive you.

426
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 You're pregnant.

427
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 What are your options?

428
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And your options are you can keep that child, and you can find folks who will support you

429
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 and care for you.

430
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 You can be courageous and just say, "Hey, I'm going to be there.

431
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 I'm going to alter my life plans.

432
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 I'm going to be a mom.

433
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 I may not be the husband of my baby's mother, but I'm going to provide for that woman."

434
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 We have examples here at Watermark of a godly man who made a decision early in his life

435
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 to be intimate with a woman that wasn't his wife, led to a child that they courageously brought to bear,

436
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 that he continues to have a good relationship with the mother, care for the child,

437
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 and is happily married, and they're both members here.

438
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 You can make the courageous decision to give the child up for adoption.

439
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Only 2% of all unwanted pregnancies, unplanned pregnancies, end up in adoption,

440
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 and you can make that courageous decision.

441
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Let me tell you a story.

442
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Two years ago, right here, March of 2016, sweet little Dominique shows up here.

443
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 This is a picture of Dominique.

444
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 She was 20 years old at the time.

445
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 She came down actually with her sister because she wanted somebody to pray for her sister.

446
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 She gets connected with some friends, and it turns out she's about to go on spring break,

447
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 and she tells these friends that probably she can go on spring break because the people that go on spring break

448
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 are the wrong playmates, and that's the wrong playground.

449
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 They encourage her not to go, but she went ahead and went anyway,

450
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 and three or four weeks after she went, she found out that she was pregnant.

451
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Dominique came back, and she already had a three-year-old, and now she's pregnant again,

452
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 and she was at a point where she didn't feel like she could handle another child,

453
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 and so she was abortion determined.

454
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 She made three different appointments with Planned Parenthood that weren't there to help plan her parenthood

455
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 but were there to help terminate the life of her precious unborn human child.

456
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 But she kept talking with Liz and Tracy, her two friends she met at the PORS,

457
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 and they did an amazing job of just walking alongside her and just helping her think through

458
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 what that growing thing inside of her was.

459
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 It was everything she is, just 20 years younger.

460
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 She had made a bad decision, but now we don't want to make another bad decision.

461
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Your bad decision shouldn't affect the life of your child, and Dominique kept listening,

462
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 and eventually she got connected to Pregnancy Resource Center,

463
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 and others around here began to care for her through her pregnancy.

464
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 She didn't really find anybody, though, in an adoption agency that she resonated with,

465
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 and we've said this before, and I'm going to say it again.

466
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Let me tell you what one of your options is going to always be.

467
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 As long as God's people are here at Watermark, if you get pregnant,

468
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 one of your options is to place that child with us in the care of a godly, loving couple.

469
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 We introduced Dominique to Allie, who had made a decision similar to the one that Dominique was about to make.

470
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Dominique and Ryan, who are members here, just said, "Hey, Dominique, we'd love to take your child.

471
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 We'd love to support you. We'd love to bring that child up."

472
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Twenty months ago, little Everett was born.

473
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 That precious, unborn human person is now 20-month-old Everett Wall.

474
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Dominique's story isn't over. Dominique continued to hang out with us here.

475
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Dominique's a member of Watermark. She's here. She's in community.

476
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 A couple of months ago, I had the privilege with Ryan and Allie to be in the water

477
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 and just celebrate Dominique's profession of life

478
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 and the forgiveness and the freedom that comes to her and anybody who seeks our gracious king.

479
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 "Hey, man, I'm pregnant. I'm asking for a friend. What are my options?"

480
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Your option is to be heroic or to enter into a horror that, even if nobody knows about it,

481
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 you're going to know about it the rest of your days.

482
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 It's not a clump of cells. It is a human, and God has given you stewardship over it.

483
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 You have a chance to not make another bad decision.

484
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 You might even have a chance to provide for another couple

485
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 who is praying for an opportunity to love a child like yours,

486
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 a chance for that child to be given to that couple and raised by them and loved by them.

487
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 You have a chance to do the hard thing, live with perspective,

488
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 and put others in front of yourself.

489
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 I'm going to sing a song, and then I'm going to come back up and tell you that

490
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 there are a bunch of men and women here tonight. We have two ministries.

491
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 One of them is called Someone Cares, and one of them is called Forgotten Fathers.

492
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Someone Cares is a ministry of women who have made an abortion decision,

493
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 and they would love to sit with you and explain to you the healing and the forgiveness that they have found.

494
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 They'd love for you to know what they now know and to find the freedom that they have found.

495
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 There are guys that have made the decision to be a part of an abortion decision,

496
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 that have processed that, that have found forgiveness and hope and reconciliation and forgiveness,

497
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 just like I have for my sins.

498
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 And they'd love to meet with you. We'd love to share with you the hope that we have.

499
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Hey, even if you don't need it right now, there's going to be a day that a friend is going to need that encouragement

500
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 to know that someone cares and they're not forgotten and that God forgives.

501
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Father, I pray that my friends in this room would be advocates for life.

502
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 I pray that if a friend comes and says, "Hey, I'm pregnant, and I'm asking what are my options,"

503
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 that they would sit them down and say, "Well, let me just tell you.

504
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 Let's first of all figure out what it is that you're pregnant with."

505
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 And they would love them and they would care for them.

506
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 They would remind them that they haven't made an unforgivable decision

507
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 about making the mistake of bringing a child into life apart from a covenant marriage relationship.

508
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 A friend that could remind them that there's a God that's good,

509
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 that can take what we intended for evil and turn it into something glorious and beautiful.

510
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 That's what our God does. He makes beauty from ashes.

511
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 They can encourage Him.

512
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Father, I pray for anybody in this room who's listening tonight.

513
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And the thing they said they'd never think about again,

514
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 they were forced to think about one more time.

515
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 And Lord, I don't want them to experience unnecessary pain,

516
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 but I certainly don't want them to miss necessary healing.

517
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 So Lord, as they're convicted of what they've been a part of,

518
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 would they be comforted with who you are and what you were a part of that they might be forgiven?

519
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Would they understand the glory of the cross?

520
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Would they understand the kindness of God?

521
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 The one who understands that humans are frail and live without perspectives

522
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 and act like they're king when they are not.

523
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 And that there is a God who does hard things,

524
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 who does put others ahead of Him,

525
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 who went to a cross He didn't deserve and died a death He didn't need to die,

526
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 that they might receive the forgiveness that they need.

527
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Father, would you bring healing to this room tonight?

528
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 We thank you, Father, that when we seek you, you answer us.

529
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 That you're the God of comfort, the God of grace.

530
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Would you remind us of that now through song?

531
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 Amen.
