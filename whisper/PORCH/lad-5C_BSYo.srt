3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,560
 >> Let's go.

4
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,760
 Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth.

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,080
 How about Kanye starting us out?

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
 Let's go, man.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:47,680
 College Dropout was the greatest album Kanye had before Yeezy, before Kim.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
 Just good old days.

9
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,680
 Hey, anyone fly a lot for their job in here?

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 Good, three of you.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,080
 Let's start with a flying story that happened not long ago with our family.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,800
 Basically, when you travel with kids, it's kind of a nightmare, and by kind of,

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,520
 I mean entirely, especially if you're getting on a plane.

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,120
 And the day had come and we had kind of packed everything up, and the reason it's kind of

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,600
 a nightmare is, one, because you're that person on the plane with the screaming child, and

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,480
 two, you're trying to like just do like Frogger, essentially, through the airport with kids

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,040
 who are running all over the place.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,600
 And so the day had come, we'd packed up all the bags.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,180
 In addition to one of the challenges is you have like 95 extra things.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,440
 The days of like, hey, I got to carry on, it'll be good, we'll figure it out, are over.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,840
 So you're packing like a child seat, you're bringing all these different things.

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,160
 And this day had come, we were going on a trip with family, got our kids there, got

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,240
 to the airport, we've got everything kind of locked in, and we had stuffed as much as

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,240
 possible into as few bags as possible, because I think we were flying like Spirit Airlines,

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,040
 which charge you for like breathing.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,080
 They're like, hey, you feel your limit, it's 50 cents from now on, and you're wearing shoes,

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,340
 that's $20 more.

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,040
 And so we were trying to like save on in terms of like the bag of stuff.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 We stuffed everything in there.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,760
 We get to the airport, we're beginning to go through the check-in process, get the bags

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,840
 checked in, we got the kids, they're kind of running everywhere.

32
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,080
 Throw the bag up on the scale.

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,000
 I had already weighed the bag at home to make sure, hey, I'm going to be below 50 pounds.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Throw the bag on the scale.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,280
 Somehow in the car, my bag gained three pounds.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,320
 No idea how.

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,240
 Lady looks at me, she's like, this is 53 pounds, you got to do something with three pounds.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,160
 It's like, oh, come on, lady, we got like kids running all around us, can we just look

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
 the other way?

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
 What's it really going to do?

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,480
 And she goes, no, you need to move things around.

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,800
 So we have to take that bag off.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,960
 Then you have to weigh the other bag to be like, how much margin do we have to work with

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
 here?

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,240
 And so we take that off, we get that bag out, and we realize, man, we don't have a ton of

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,760
 margin to work with.

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
 We got to get rid of these three pounds, begin going through.

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,200
 And here's the worst part of this whole situation if you've been to the airport before.

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,440
 No one is ever at the airport with like tons of time to spare, right?

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,200
 No one, unless you're like psychotic, is like, you know I love to spend a good afternoon

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
 in the airport.

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,240
 And so I like to get there early, take my time, enjoy the Starbucks.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,120
 And so you're always like in a hurry, and so they're like, hey, you got to get three

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
 pounds up.

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
 There's 150 people behind you.

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,040
 She's basically like, hey, you got to get your stuff out of there.

57
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,360
 You're opening up your bag, your underwear is falling out in front of all these strangers

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
 in front of you.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
 And you're like, what weighs three pounds?

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
 Does the shoe weigh three pounds?

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,120
 What should I get rid of that's going to weigh three pounds?

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,880
 Because I got to get less than that in here.

63
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,600
 So we're going through that whole process of trying to figure out how to get the weight

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,080
 on the scale because they're saying, hey, that's too much weight.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
 We will not allow that to pass through.

66
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,320
 You need to make sure that you do something with that.

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,600
 So we're taking out shoes, stuffing them into our backpack, trying to get everything

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
 below the weight limit.

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,520
 And the reason I start there is because tonight we're going to talk about a subject that is

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,160
 related to the idea that I think when it comes to God and particularly having a relationship

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,800
 with God, there are many people in our world and many Christians, sadly, or people who

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,920
 think that they're Christians, who think that God operates a little bit like the check-in

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,400
 clerk at the airport.

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,720
 That, hey, you're going to bring your baggage in here, but let me make sure you know there

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 is a weight limit.

76
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,120
 And so if you bring too much baggage in, you're on your own.

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,800
 You're either going to have to carry that onto the airport or you're going to have to

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
 pay an additional fee or fine.

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,760
 That if you bring too much baggage in, that God's going to cut you out of that relationship

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,640
 or it's going to cost you.

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,880
 And not only that, we often think that as it relates to like our baggage in life, there

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,080
 are certain things that weigh certain sins, if you will, that weigh more than other sins.

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,360
 And nobody would articulate it exactly like that, but we often think that, hey, there's

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:35,000
 certain sins that if your baggage is just kind of jealousy and gossip and occasional

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,120
 speeding and maybe you had too much to drink at prom, it's not that big of a deal.

86
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,320
 But if it includes adultery, oh man, that's going to put you over the limit.

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,720
 If it includes abortion, homosexuality, if it includes any of the more serious, like

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,360
 that's just too much weight, you're going to have to either pay more or it's going to

89
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,960
 cost you and you're going to have to kind of work some of that off or you're not going

90
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
 to be allowed in.

91
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,000
 Tragically, Christians often even contribute to this.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,120
 Where there's this idea of whatever reason, a lot of people like think of our sins as

93
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,800
 though there's like a scale and certain sins weigh more than other sins.

94
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,000
 And so, you know, pornography or addiction or alcoholism, like that's going to be a really

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
 heavy bag.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 You got to deal with that or you're not getting in.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,240
 But some other sins that are just kind of, you know, the occasional lying you cheated

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,160
 on your algebra test one time, that's not that big of a deal.

99
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,240
 And what we're going to talk about tonight and explore and study and discover is that

100
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,000
 our idea of a scale and this idea that, hey, there's a certain baggage limit and there's

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,300
 a certain type of sin or different sins that really put you over the limit of the reach

102
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,880
 of God is totally false.

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,120
 But the Bible says that God doesn't operate like humans think, that there's kind of this

104
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,920
 scale of sins and this is really intense.

105
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,080
 And if you do these types of things, you're really far from God and you got to work your

106
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 way back.

107
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,680
 But he doesn't operate like that at all.

108
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,320
 And we're going to discover in a story in Luke chapter 19, how Jesus approaches really

109
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:18,120
 sinful people and do so by looking at one of the most notorious sinful people in all

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,840
 of the New Testament and the interaction that Jesus had with them.

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,120
 We're kicking off a series called Jesus Walks where for the next six weeks, we're going

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,760
 to look at certain interactions and exchanges that Jesus, while he was on the planet, he

113
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,200
 would walk up to different people and he would have an exchange that would totally blow the

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,880
 paradigm of usually the person he was talking to and certainly everyone around him and the

115
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,840
 disciples, they were always confused.

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,640
 And how Jesus, who came to this planet to correct humanity's perspective on what God

117
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,840
 is like, shows up and he says, "The scale that everyone has is off."

118
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,880
 The way that God sees humanity is not the way that you think God sees humanity.

119
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,440
 So we're going to jump into Luke chapter 19.

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,320
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.

121
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,240
 We're going to look at a very famous man whose name was Zacchaeus.

122
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,640
 Now, if you grew up in church, there's a song that goes along with Zacchaeus.

123
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,320
 Anyone know this song?

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 Zacchaeus was a what?

125
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,400
 Oh man, whoever came up with that, dude.

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,920
 Hopefully, they're getting royalties because that thing went viral.

127
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 He was a wee little man.

128
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,720
 A wee little man was he.

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,920
 He sat up in a sycamore tree.

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,200
 Some of you guys haven't been in church in like 10 years, but you have got this one on lock.

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,560
 You know it better than Kanye's "Jesus Walk" song.

132
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,840
 Here's the problem with that song, just before we dive in, because that song sanitizes who

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,880
 Zacchaeus was.

134
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,360
 Zacchaeus was not a good guy.

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,880
 He wasn't a guy that people would be like, "Oh, little Zac, little cutie right there."

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,080
 He wasn't a guy that we today would look at and be like, "Oh man, that guy, I just love

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,120
 how Jesus is going after him."

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,160
 Zacchaeus was a borderline criminal.

139
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,000
 He was a guy that didn't have a good reputation of the day and one of the most notorious sinners

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 of his day.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,480
 And so we're going to dive in and look at Jesus's exchange, and I'll explain more what

142
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,520
 I'm talking about here in a second, but we'll start in verse 1 of chapter 19.

143
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,280
 And if you don't have a Bible, the verses will be on the screen.

144
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,160
 There's also Bibles in the Welcome Center.

145
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
 That's our gift to you if you'd like one.

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,400
 We'll jump in right here.

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,080
 Now Jesus entered Jericho and he made his way through the town.

148
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,440
 There was a man there named Zacchaeus.

149
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,120
 He was a chief tax collector in the region, and he had become very rich.

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
 So here's what happens.

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
 Jesus is on his way to Jerusalem.

152
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,360
 That's kind of the timeline.

153
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
 He's going to Jerusalem to be crucified.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 That's where we are in the story, if you will.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,440
 And he's walking through, and on the way there, there's a town named Jericho.

156
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,920
 Jericho, here's all you got to know.

157
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,360
 It is like Beverly Hills in Palestine.

158
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,240
 It is the wealthy.

159
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
 It's where the wealthy would live.

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,280
 It was only the richest of the rich.

161
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,960
 People got vacation homes there.

162
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,080
 It's like San Diego in that it's 70 degrees year-round.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,800
 One of the commentators or historians writes, "Jericho was such a nice place because you

164
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,960
 could wear linens all year-round."

165
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
 That's your thing.

166
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,200
 And just the point being that it was a very consistent 70 degrees.

167
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,680
 Palm trees are everywhere, so only the elite of the elite.

168
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,120
 And inside of this town, there's a man named Zacchaeus.

169
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,160
 And we're told something that would have made his audience or would have made the original

170
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,880
 readers go, "What?"

171
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,400
 Zacchaeus was a tax collector.

172
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
 And not just any tax collector, chief tax collector.

173
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 What does that mean?

174
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
 Is that like the IRS?

175
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,120
 Because nobody's big fans of the IRS.

176
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,560
 Is that what he's trying to say?

177
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
 No.

178
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
 There's really not exactly a modern equivalent today.

179
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,000
 It would be like the IRS if the IRS was known for cheating and robbing you out of your money.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
 Hopefully, they're not.

181
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,520
 And the money that they were using was financing an oppressive army.

182
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,720
 And it would only be Jewish men and women who said, "You know what, dude?

183
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
 I'm deuces on God.

184
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,240
 I really don't believe this whole thing anymore.

185
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,960
 I don't believe the Jewish faith.

186
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,240
 I'm out on that.

187
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,280
 And the Roman army is gonna pay me to be a tax collector.

188
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,800
 And I can charge people whatever I want if I'm a tax collector.

189
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,160
 So yeah, I'll do that."

190
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
 So he was seen as a traitor.

191
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,480
 This would be like a Jewish person in Nazi Germany saying, "You know what?

192
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,840
 I'm not really a fan of any of these other people too, so I'll work for you guys."

193
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,880
 Zacchaeus was a hated person.

194
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,680
 And we're not told he was just a tax collector.

195
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,760
 He was a chief tax collector, that he had not been doing this for a month, a year, 10

196
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,080
 years, maybe, 20 years.

197
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 He had worked his way up.

198
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,760
 He had tax collectors working for him.

199
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 He was a man who was known for ripping people off.

200
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,000
 And he was extremely wealthy.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
 So here's what you know about him.

202
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,620
 He was hated.

203
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,620
 He was feared.

204
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,200
 If you jumped into him, he could take anything you have.

205
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,960
 He could tax you above and beyond.

206
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,360
 And he was incredibly rich.

207
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,160
 His only friends would have been other tax collectors.

208
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,360
 He's the dude who's driving around.

209
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,640
 He's got the Lambo.

210
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
 He's got the houses everywhere.

211
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,520
 He's wearing the nicest clothes, only eats the best food, has an unreal house.

212
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,280
 One person said, "This is the wealthiest person in the New Testament, Zacchaeus."

213
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,760
 And I'm pointing all that out because a lot of times we think of Zacchaeus as like, man,

214
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
 he's like the prostitute and the marginalizer.

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,400
 There's Jesus again going after the guy that, I love that about Jesus.

216
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,760
 This would have been like, Jesus, why would you have any interest in this man?

217
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,980
 He's the guy who took my grandma's retirement savings away.

218
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,940
 He's a guy who's ruined lives.

219
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,120
 And Jesus comes along and they're about to have an exchange together.

220
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,280
 Now he, that's speaking of Zacchaeus, verse three, tried to get a look at Jesus, but he

221
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,080
 was too short to see over the crowd.

222
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,700
 So Jesus is walking through.

223
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,520
 Now this time Jesus is really famous because we're told earlier, shortly before this, he

224
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,940
 had raised the guy from the dead.

225
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,720
 And something happens when you raise people from the dead, as I'm sure you know.

226
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,940
 Your popularity kind of goes through the roof.

227
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,920
 And so everywhere he goes now, there's like crowds following him.

228
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,640
 There's a parade that begins to form as Jesus is walking through.

229
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,460
 They've heard this man, Jesus, is coming.

230
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,160
 And Zacchaeus is too short, we're told.

231
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,560
 He can't really see and he's looking through the crowd.

232
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,220
 So here's what he does.

233
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,760
 So he ran ahead and he climbed a sycamore fig tree beside the road for Jesus was going

234
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,300
 to pass that way.

235
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:20,080
 When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and he called him by name, Zacchaeus.

236
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,840
 He said, "Quick, come down.

237
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,360
 I must be a guest at your home today."

238
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,160
 Zacchaeus quickly calmed down and took Jesus into his house with great excitement and joy.

239
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,200
 But the people were displeased.

240
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,360
 They said, "He," speaking of Jesus, "has gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner."

241
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 They grumbled.

242
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,880
 So Jesus, he's going through the parade.

243
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,400
 Zacchaeus is kind of getting up, wondering what he's going to look like.

244
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,760
 And all of a sudden, he's looking down at the parade, Zacchaeus from the tree, and he

245
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
 sees this man.

246
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,160
 Everyone's gathered around to see Jesus.

247
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,280
 And Jesus stops the parade and he looks up in the tree and says, "Zacchaeus, what was

248
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
 that moment like?

249
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,520
 A total stranger shows up from out of town and he knows your name?"

250
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,160
 And he says, "Come down.

251
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,760
 I'm going to spend my rest of the day with you.

252
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
 I'm going into your house."

253
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,520
 What that basically meant in that time would be like, "Hey, I'm associating with you.

254
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,640
 I want to have a relationship with you."

255
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,680
 And the crowd reacts like many of us would react.

256
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
 "What are you doing?

257
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,760
 Do you not know who this person is?

258
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 Do you not know what home you're going into?

259
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,600
 Do you not know how he paid for the home you're about to go into?"

260
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,280
 This is Jesus coming through town.

261
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,360
 He goes into Hugh Hefner's home.

262
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,000
 He's the guy they don't want to spend time with in this whole city.

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,640
 He doesn't talk to anybody but Zacchaeus.

264
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,040
 First idea really we see from this, and really the three points that I'm going to give you

265
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
 tonight.

266
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,800
 My biggest fear is that these are truths that are so tremendously important and yet for

267
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,160
 many of you, they're going to fall on deaf ears because you've heard them but you really

268
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 haven't embraced them.

269
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 But the first idea that we see from this interaction of Jesus saying, "Hey, before you do anything

270
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,920
 right Zacchaeus, I'm coming to be with you."

271
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,760
 It's simply that your sin doesn't keep Christ from seeking you.

272
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,520
 Your sin, anyone else's sin, sin in general, is not a barrier for Christ to come and have

273
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,880
 a relationship with you.

274
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,720
 This was not just a wee little man, this was a wicked little man.

275
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,000
 And Jesus before anything had been done right in Zacchaeus' life says, "I want to have a

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,520
 relationship with you.

277
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,680
 I'm coming in to spend time with you before you get anything right in your life.

278
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,600
 You're the one that I want to spend and have a relationship with."

279
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,200
 I know there's many of you in the room, you think that there's a barrier between God wanting

280
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,560
 to know you, seeking after you, having a relationship with you because of sin in your past, sin

281
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,880
 in your present, that there's a God who's there, that your behavior today or your behavior

282
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
 in your past is a barrier for him.

283
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,800
 But the truth of the Bible is your sin does not keep Christ from seeking after you.

284
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,280
 Christ was far more interested in seeking Zacchaeus than Zacchaeus was in seeing him.

285
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,680
 And he said, "I'm going into your house today."

286
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,880
 Oftentimes it seems like we're so like bent to be like, "Dude, if I'm going to have a

287
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,040
 relationship with God, I really need to get things in order in my life."

288
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,080
 And it's kind of like this, this past weekend we had a birthday party for my one-year-old

289
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 daughter.

290
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,200
 It was her birthday and so it was at our house, we planned it all out and we realized like

291
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,600
 the day before, "Man, we need to clean this place."

292
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,920
 We have family friends coming over, family in our community coming over.

293
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,120
 And so for the next like for eight hours straight, I mean, we are cleaning this entire house,

294
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,320
 we're putting candles in rooms that have never seen candles before.

295
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,960
 My wife is like getting out brownies and baking.

296
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,800
 We haven't baked brownies maybe ever in this house.

297
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
 We're cleaning everything.

298
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,280
 It's as though we're like, "Hey, we need to make this place look like no one has ever

299
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
 lived here before."

300
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,440
 So we're cleaning, we're throwing pillows on different stuff.

301
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,320
 If it can't be shoved in a closet and it's in the way clutter, it's like just throw it

302
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 in the trash.

303
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
 We need to get this stuff out of here.

304
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 There's people coming over here to see us.

305
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,080
 True story, we got a babysitter so that we could clean.

306
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,880
 How embarrassing is that?

307
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,520
 It was like, man, this is terrible.

308
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,640
 And this was our closest friends and family.

309
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,800
 It was like the people who are closest to us in the world, we need to pretend that our

310
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,240
 life is a lot more in order than possible.

311
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,880
 So people are coming over, there's music on, "Let me light this candle.

312
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,640
 I'm in an apron just baking over here.

313
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
 Hey, how are you?"

314
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,960
 And yeah, this is just like our life.

315
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
 This is always what it looks like.

316
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,600
 And how ridiculous is that?

317
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,200
 Because despite being the closest people that we have a relationship with, there's part

318
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,200
 of us that feels like, man, we need to pretend that kind of our life is in order and this

319
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,240
 is all great.

320
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,080
 And sadly, that is how a lot of people think when it comes to God.

321
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,400
 That, hey, you've got to get life in order.

322
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,720
 If God's going to come have a relationship with you, if you're going to really experience

323
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,920
 knowing Jesus, that you first need to clean yourself up.

324
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,320
 You need to make sure things are in order.

325
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,680
 You need to put things and just kind of keep them in the closet of your past before God

326
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,120
 wants to come in and have a relationship with you.

327
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,360
 The message of Zacchaeus or really this story that we're looking at is before anything had

328
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,560
 changed, Jesus said, "I've been seeking after you."

329
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,600
 Before anything changes in your life, in your world, Jesus has been seeking after you and

330
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,080
 you don't have to pretend.

331
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,240
 Just like you shouldn't have to pretend with family and friends, like, "Hey, this is what's

332
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 going on."

333
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,680
 The God who's there knows everything.

334
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,760
 And it's crazy that there's still some part of us that feels like I have to pretend.

335
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,600
 Like, what do I mean by that?

336
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:19,400
 I mean, the desire to kind of seem like, you know, "God, I'm worthy of your love," can

337
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,080
 manifest itself in all kinds of ways.

338
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,160
 Like, some of you, you pray weird because you're trying to impress God.

339
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,800
 Have you ever been around someone like this?

340
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,040
 Like all of a sudden, they're like, "Hey, I feel like I just need to downshift into

341
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,400
 King James Version."

342
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 And they're just beginning to pray.

343
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,360
 Or you know, like, the way that you pray is you, it's basically like you're reading the

344
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 Declaration of Independence.

345
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,440
 It's like, "Our Father, we owe these truths to be self-evident."

346
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,320
 And you're like trying to almost be impressive as though that's why God wants to listen or

347
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
 would listen.

348
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,120
 Others of you, you feel like you can't come to church after you got wasted on Saturday

349
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
 night.

350
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,440
 You're like, "I got to give a little space, let this thing breathe a little bit.

351
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,060
 I feel like I, you know, haven't behaved in a way that God really would want to have anything

352
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
 to do with me."

353
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,600
 Some of you, you're not reading your Bible because you're looking at pornography consistently,

354
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,480
 and it just fills you with shame and you continue on the cycle.

355
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,240
 Shame can manifest itself in all kinds of ways.

356
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,440
 Some of you, maybe you feel like God, if He's there, doesn't want to have anything to do

357
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,400
 with you because you're filled on the inside when you're alone and when you're really honest

358
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,080
 with yourself with shame, and it drives you from Him.

359
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,760
 And the message of Zacchaeus and the message really of Jesus all throughout the Bible is

360
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,280
 that there is no sin that keeps the Savior from seeking to have a relationship, from

361
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,200
 seeking to walk in relationship with you.

362
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,720
 The truth is God knows everything about your life.

363
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
 Like there is no pretending, there is no hiding.

364
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,400
 He sees all the closets.

365
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,760
 He sees within everything.

366
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,440
 He knows what you did last summer and four summers ago.

367
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,920
 He knows everything broken and messed up, and He says, "I want to come spend time with

368
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,760
 you, Zacchaeus, and I want to come spend time with you."

369
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:02,360
 Fill in the blank, that your sin does not keep Christ from seeking after you.

370
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,440
 The Bible teaches that it is not, you know, hey, there's some good people and bad people

371
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,960
 because there's really another flawed way that I think a lot of us think about ourselves

372
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,880
 really and kind of as it relates to God.

373
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,480
 And if the first is that flawed idea that I got to clean myself up before God wants

374
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,160
 to know me, the second is that, man, I really don't even have that much to clean up.

375
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,120
 There's some people that are pretty messed up and they really need to clean up.

376
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,040
 It's kind of a lie about this, hey, I'm not really that bad of a person.

377
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,320
 That Jesus wants to have a relationship with sinners and I love that and He also wants

378
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,880
 to have relationships with me, you know, because I'm a pretty good guy.

379
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,920
 And the Bible would say that's crazy.

380
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
 Humans think like this.

381
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,960
 They're like, hey, there's good people and there's bad people.

382
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,760
 There's people with a good heart and people with a bad heart.

383
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,640
 It's like, you know, good heart, which is me and you, of course, and then there's like

384
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,000
 the bad hearts that are like Hitler and Osama bin Laden and ISIS, like those are the bad

385
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 apples.

386
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,120
 And the Bible doesn't teach that there's some good people and bad people.

387
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,440
 It says there's only bad people and one good guy, Jesus, who came to die for all the bad

388
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,920
 and broken people in this world.

389
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,000
 And so inside of the room, the other lie that you can buy is, hey, I need to clean everything

390
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,560
 up in my life before God could want me, is that, hey, I deserve for God to want me in

391
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,520
 all of my greatness 'cause I'm really not that bad of a person.

392
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
 And Jesus said, I came for sinners.

393
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,900
 The only way you can have a relationship with me is to acknowledge you are a sinner.

394
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,760
 You have fallen short of God's standards.

395
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,840
 You're not a good person.

396
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,760
 Another way of saying it is the gap between you and Hitler is much smaller than the gap

397
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,720
 between you and Jesus.

398
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,520
 And he's come for sinners.

399
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,480
 And let me be abundantly clear, 'cause there's some people in the room that you think, you've

400
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,680
 kind of got this like workspace theology to, hey, if I'm good, God will accept me.

401
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,160
 If I, you know, pretty much don't steal and murder anybody, like I'll be fine.

402
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,520
 And the Bible doesn't teach that.

403
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,040
 It teaches everyone is messed up, everyone is sinners, everyone is broken.

404
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,440
 And Jesus did not just become and come to be a friend of sinners.

405
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,560
 Let me be abundantly clear.

406
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,380
 He is only the friend of sinners.

407
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,080
 He's only the friend of people who are willing to say, I need a savior.

408
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,760
 My life is messed up, no matter how good I think I am, no matter how I stack up to the

409
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,760
 person next to me, no matter how bad I think I am and how far I've fallen from the standards

410
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,920
 of my parents or my standards of my friends or my own standards, I need a savior.

411
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,360
 That is the person who, like Zacchaeus, is a candidate for God's grace.

412
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
 The crowd, here's the irony, the craziness of the crowd.

413
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,400
 They look at Jesus as he goes into the house of Zacchaeus and they go, what?

414
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,280
 This guy's gone in to be the home guest of a notorious sinner.

415
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,680
 The irony in that is everyone in that crowd was a sinner.

416
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,880
 Think about it.

417
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,980
 Jesus could have come out of that house and been like, look, all right, Beverly, I know

418
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,080
 what you did, had too much drink last night.

419
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,920
 You slept with somebody who wasn't your wife and you, I feel like you got a little tipsy

420
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 at prom that one time.

421
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,720
 He could have come out and pointed out everything wrong and broken in every single person in

422
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,600
 that crowd's life, but the crowd couldn't see it.

423
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,480
 They saw, like many people today see, hey, there's kind of good people like us and then

424
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,920
 there's bad people.

425
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,600
 We deserve God's love, but they don't.

426
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,360
 You are never more in danger of hell than when you begin to believe things like that.

427
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,640
 You're someone who, hey, if God's out there, as long as I'm a pretty good person, he should

428
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
 accept me.

429
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,740
 The Bible says that there is no exceptions, no exceptions to who God will accept, as long

430
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,520
 as the acceptance is that trusting in what God did, what Christ did on my behalf.

431
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 He paid for it.

432
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,960
 Not because I earned it, not because I deserve it, but because he paid for it.

433
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,120
 And Zacchaeus went in and he experienced for the very first time a relationship with God

434
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,280
 that he'd given up long ago and something happened.

435
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,280
 Verse seven, "But the people were displeased and they said, 'He's gone in to be the guest

436
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,840
 of a notorious sinner.'

437
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,000
 Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said, 'I will give half of my wealth to

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 the poor.

439
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,400
 And if I have cheated any people on their taxes, I will give them four times as much.'"

440
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,280
 There's something that happens between verse seven and eight that we're not given vision

441
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
 into.

442
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,280
 Jesus goes into the house, they share a meal.

443
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,880
 We don't know if it was four hours, we don't know if it was an entire day, maybe it was

444
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,360
 just an evening.

445
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:29,120
 But they're hanging together and you've got to think, like, what is Zacchaeus thinking?

446
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,040
 He's looking into the eyes of probably the most compassionate person he's ever seen and

447
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,360
 will ever see.

448
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,580
 He's seeing the man that everyone in crowds want to see and they're eating a meal together

449
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,840
 and he doesn't feel condemnation and rejection and shame, we're not told any of that.

450
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,880
 And something begins to happen inside of that meal.

451
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,120
 If I was Zacchaeus, I'd be wondering, does Jesus know what paid for the food that he's

452
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
 eating right now?

453
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,080
 Like, does he know what I've done?

454
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,320
 Does he know who I am?

455
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,480
 And the answer would be yes.

456
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,000
 And throughout the course of that meal, something happened to Zacchaeus and everything began

457
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 to change.

458
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,800
 It's as though in the midst of the conversation, he wells up, he can't stand it anymore, and

459
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,640
 he stands up, he's like, "I've got to make a toast.

460
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,560
 I'm changing everything.

461
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,480
 Jesus, I'm changing everything.

462
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,360
 I'm giving half of everything that I own away to the poor.

463
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,180
 If I've cheated anyone, if I've sinned or robbed against anybody, I'm not just going

464
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,680
 to pay back what I took from them, I'm going to go back and pay four times what I took

465
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,600
 from them originally."

466
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,000
 And everything began to change.

467
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,440
 Zacchaeus experienced the love of Christ and it changed him.

468
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,800
 The second idea really from this text is that it is love, not laws, that lead to lasting

469
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 change.

470
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,200
 It's love, not laws, that lead to lasting change.

471
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,000
 What drove Zacchaeus was he encountered the love of Jesus and it drove him out of a love

472
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,200
 in response to that to extravagant ends.

473
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,700
 What do I mean by that?

474
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,920
 He just said, "I'm going to give half of everything that I owe to the poor, and if I owe anybody

475
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,240
 four times," he's like, "Dude, if I go broke on all this, I don't even care.

476
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,500
 So I'm selling the Lambo, I'm getting rid of the camels and the chariots, whatever I

477
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,640
 got to, I'm giving it away, Jesus, because you're worth more than all of that."

478
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
 Think about that.

479
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,440
 Half of everything you owe, if your roommate came home tonight and they're like, "Hey,

480
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,760
 dude, I met Jesus, I'm giving away half of everything that I've done, can't believe it,"

481
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,800
 what would you think?

482
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,520
 Some of you don't even tithe, and when you do, you're like, "I feel like I'm doing a

483
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
 favor to God.

484
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
 Here's $25."

485
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,000
 Zacchaeus says, "Half of everything, I don't even care anymore."

486
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,480
 Clearly a man who had changed.

487
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,360
 Further extravagant was the fact that he said, "I'm going to pay back way beyond what the

488
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,680
 law requires."

489
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,480
 This was not about what the law says, it was about love.

490
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,680
 He had encountered the love of Christ and it changed him and moved him out of a love

491
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,520
 for Christ to change.

492
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
 What do I mean by that?

493
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,680
 In the Old Testament, if you cheated somebody, if you stole from somebody, there was a law.

494
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,360
 It said this in Leviticus chapter 6, verse 1 through 5.

495
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,320
 It says, "If you steal, you have to pay back what you stole plus one-fifth."

496
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,600
 So if I stole $100, I pay back $100 plus one-fifth, that's $20.

497
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,320
 So that's $120.

498
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,400
 Zacchaeus says, "Everybody that I stole $100 from, I'm giving an additional $400 to.

499
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,280
 I'm going above and beyond, way beyond what the law being required."

500
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 Think about that.

501
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,480
 I mean, this would be the equivalent of if you've ever had your car stereo stolen, somebody

502
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,880
 showing up at your door and being like, "Hey, sorry, stole the stereo, so here's this and

503
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
 here's four more."

504
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,640
 You'd be like, "What?

505
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
 Who are you?"

506
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,160
 And Zacchaeus, one by one, went to the people he had stolen from because it was not law

507
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
 that drove.

508
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,040
 This is what changes people, man.

509
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,560
 What's changed people in the room is not like they've come to church and they've got some

510
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,040
 new rules and some code that's led them to be like, "Oh, now I'm going to really try

511
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
 to be a good person."

512
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
 That doesn't work.

513
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,920
 What changed Zacchaeus was love.

514
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:01,400
 He encountered the love of Christ and it drove him out of a response of love towards Christ

515
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
 and everything began to change.

516
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,440
 Some of you inside of the room, the reason why, like maybe you're here and you came with

517
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,840
 a friend and you've like seen their life.

518
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,000
 I hear this story all the time.

519
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,720
 Like, "Dude, yeah, a buddy of mine, he's been going to your church and it's like, man, he's

520
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,520
 like uber Christian, like all over the top.

521
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,640
 He's like there like four nights a week.

522
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,160
 He doesn't do any of this stuff we don't, we used to like, you know, go smoke a bowl.

523
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,360
 He's not into that anymore."

524
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,720
 It's just totally changed.

525
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,280
 Why?

526
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,480
 Is because some new rules that he's found?

527
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
 No.

528
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,720
 He's found and fell in love with a savior and experienced the love of Christ that has made

529
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
 him go, "I don't care what I have to leave behind.

530
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,240
 Everything I'm experiencing here is so much better.

531
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,080
 So if no one goes with me, I'm going."

532
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,680
 And Zacchaeus said, "Whatever it costs, I don't care.

533
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 I'm making a change."

534
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,760
 And it was out of an overflow and response to that love that he moved.

535
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,960
 Some of you, the reason why like Christians hate sin and the reasons why we fight against

536
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,240
 sin is not because we have to in order to have a relationship with God.

537
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,020
 It's because we have a relationship with God and we don't want anything to interrupt the

538
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,920
 intimacy that we can experience with him.

539
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,960
 So it's like, "Man, I'm going to fight against anything.

540
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,600
 I'm going to confess sin inside of my life, whether it's anger or lust, masturbation,

541
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,200
 pornography, stuff from my past, anything that could inhibit that because Jesus is so

542
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 much better.

543
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,760
 This is how and why people change."

544
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,080
 It's not because of just some like, "Here, keep these 12 different rules that you have

545
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
 to run through."

546
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,040
 And Zacchaeus in a moment encounters the love of God and changes.

547
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,320
 We've seen love changes people.

548
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
 We've all seen this.

549
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,360
 If you've ever seen somebody dating, if you've ever dated before, like you see people like

550
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,160
 adopt new habits, new hobbies when they start dating somebody.

551
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,640
 Like we've all, maybe you have a guy friend who's like, "Yeah, now I get pedicures.

552
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 It's what we do.

553
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
 And you know, it's cool, man.

554
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
 I'm into it."

555
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,440
 And you're like, "Okay."

556
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,360
 And or the girl who's like, "Yes, I love the cowboys."

557
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,720
 And it's because she started dating some guy with the cowboys.

558
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,840
 And you're like, "Can you name a cowboy?"

559
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,560
 And you're like, "Dirk Nowinski."

560
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,240
 And like, "I don't think, I think you're just into this because he's into this."

561
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,440
 Like when people fall in love, they change.

562
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,760
 The best one of all time is particularly around guys and ladies.

563
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,600
 You may never even see this, but this is what happens.

564
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,720
 Let me tell you what happens every time a guy calls you.

565
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,440
 If he's hanging out with these buddies, dude, this is gold.

566
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520
 I'm going to try to be short here.

567
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,280
 He's hanging out, it happens to all of us, myself included, hanging out with your buddies.

568
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,720
 You're like, "Yeah, dude, I cannot believe, you know, Dak, that happened.

569
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,400
 Oh my gosh, some massive words."

570
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,440
 And then you'll call and it's like, "Hey, give me a sec.

571
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
 Oh, hi.

572
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
 Yeah.

573
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
 Oh no."

574
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,460
 It's to the point where it changes them so much.

575
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,840
 We always walk away.

576
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,280
 We're like, "We're going to give you guys a second."

577
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,360
 And it happens every single time you walk over there.

578
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,360
 You're like, "No, I love you.

579
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
 No, you hang up.

580
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
 No, you hang up.

581
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
 No, you."

582
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,120
 And it's like, he goes from all of a sudden thug life to Romeo because love changes people.

583
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
 Dude, that is true.

584
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
 It happens every time.

585
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,280
 Guys, you know what I'm talking about.

586
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,440
 Because love changes people.

587
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,720
 It leads to different behavior and different actions.

588
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,760
 It far exceeds anything the law could do.

589
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,680
 Just like in that dating relationship, like if somebody just told you, "Hey, I want you

590
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,280
 to like that girl.

591
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,280
 Here's the rules.

592
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,200
 When you talk on the phone, you got to talk like, you know, you're back in seventh grade,

593
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,320
 pre-puberty, and that's what you have to do."

594
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,240
 People would not do it if they didn't actually have a desire, a love, and affection for that

595
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
 girl in the same way.

596
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,960
 This is why, and this is how Christians live the Christian faith and Christian life.

597
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,320
 This is why people change.

598
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,040
 This is why people begin to make decisions more in line with that because they're like,

599
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,920
 "Dude, I just want more of Jesus."

600
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,880
 And I begin to experience it in such a royal way.

601
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,680
 I just want more and more of that.

602
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,040
 Zacchaeus experienced it and everything changed.

603
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,280
 It's love, not law that leads to lasting change.

604
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,600
 Jude, the brother of Jesus.

605
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 Jude has one book in the Bible.

606
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 It's only one chapter long.

607
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,040
 It's a very short Bible or a very short book.

608
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:06,200
 And in that chapter, he says something about the way that the Christian life is lived.

609
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,680
 Here's a guy who actually, Jesus' baby brother, you may not know that.

610
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:12,200
 There's two guys in the Bible who wrote books in the New Testament, scholars would say,

611
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,240
 are the brothers of Jesus, Jude and James.

612
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,640
 And Jude writes in the 21st verse, he says, "Here's what I want you to do.

613
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:26,120
 Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to

614
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,600
 bring you to eternal life."

615
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,240
 What do I do, Jude?

616
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,360
 We're waiting on God.

617
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,200
 We're trying to make sure that we live out the Christian life.

618
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,080
 How do I spend the rest of my life?

619
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
 Keep yourselves in the love of God.

620
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,520
 Think about that sentence from the little brother of Jesus who says, "Hey, hey, let

621
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,200
 me give you a secret.

622
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,640
 Keep yourselves in God's love for you."

623
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,960
 You want to be someone who actually experiences change in your life.

624
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,280
 You want to live out the Christian life.

625
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,200
 It won't come by bootstrap obedience, by trying harder, and anyone who tells you it

626
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480
 will is lying to you.

627
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,800
 It comes by experiencing God's love, understanding how God sees you, that despite the fact that

628
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:06,520
 you did not earn it, you don't deserve it, that God loved and sought and seeks you.

629
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,160
 Wherever you're at right now, whatever you're going through, whatever you did today, that

630
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,720
 there's a God who's crazy in love with you.

631
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,240
 And Jude says, "Hey, here's what I want you to do while you wait.

632
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,920
 Church for all of eternity until Jesus comes back."

633
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,760
 Or for how many thousand years?

634
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,040
 Keep yourselves in God's love.

635
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,240
 And then you know what happens?

636
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,920
 You'll love because he loved you.

637
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,800
 That's what 1 John chapter 4 says.

638
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,320
 That it ends up overflowing inside of your life.

639
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,360
 Some of you, more than anything else, I hope you hear that.

640
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,280
 That you would think and operate as someone who sees themselves, that your identity is

641
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,320
 so wrapped.

642
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,960
 Jesus loves me, the God of the universe, the God who created the stars and breathed all

643
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:58,760
 things into existence, loves me to the point where he would die on a cross for me, for

644
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:07,880
 you, despite everything messed up in your life.

645
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,440
 Zacchaeus experienced that love and it changed him.

646
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,720
 Verse 9 says this, about to close.

647
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,920
 And Jesus responded, "Dude, I love this.

648
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,080
 Salvation has come to this home today.

649
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,880
 For this man has shown himself to be a true son of Abraham.

650
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:37,000
 For the son of man came to seek and to save those who are lost.

651
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,280
 That salvation has come to this house."

652
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,960
 He's a child of Abraham basically means like, hey, he's a true child of the faith.

653
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,500
 He's one of the descendants of Abraham, the father of faith.

654
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,360
 He's one of those followers.

655
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,480
 He's a true follower.

656
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,320
 But he experienced a conversion with Jesus in that moment.

657
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,200
 And the reason I said I love it is what does he say?

658
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,160
 Salvation came to this person's house.

659
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:09,440
 He personifies salvation, which is so interesting because who came to Zacchaeus' house?

660
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,520
 Jesus.

661
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,080
 The third thing we see from the story, and this is so huge for so many of you who grew

662
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,640
 up in backgrounds and denominational faiths that don't teach this, what we just see in

663
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,760
 this passage, salvation begins and is about a person, not a process.

664
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,080
 Salvation comes with a person, not a process.

665
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,840
 Salvation comes with a person named Jesus.

666
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,000
 It has a name, Jesus.

667
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 It is not a process.

668
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,040
 It doesn't take place over you keeping sacraments over your life.

669
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,800
 The Bible teaches the message of Jesus.

670
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,840
 Hey, salvation showed up at this guy's house because that salvation is me.

671
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,360
 Salvation begins and is experienced and is about a person.

672
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,520
 It's about you knowing Jesus, not about you keeping a process over your life.

673
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,240
 Salvation is about a person, not about you doing confessional, getting baptized, keeping

674
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,800
 a certain number of sacraments, praying a certain number of times a day.

675
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,000
 It begins and has always been about a person.

676
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,200
 And Zacchaeus encounters in a moment of faith a person.

677
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,480
 And in doing so, he encountered salvation.

678
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
 Everything changed.

679
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,840
 His past changed, his current day changed, and he changed.

680
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,640
 Christianity to keep going along those lines we've already said, begins to take place and

681
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,440
 the process only takes place after the person in that relationship with Christ has started.

682
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,640
 And you enter into this unending, unbreakable covenant with Jesus.

683
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
 And then the process takes place.

684
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,040
 But the Bible says that's his responsibility, not yours.

685
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,480
 He's the one who's faithful to continue the good work that he started in you, Philippians

686
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,840
 chapter one verse six says.

687
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,200
 And it is that relationship, that new covenant that brings about change.

688
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,520
 It's not dissimilar to this.

689
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,400
 Like when I got married, there was a new covenant relationship I entered into, a new person

690
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,440
 in my world and a new way, and everything changed.

691
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
 What do I mean by that?

692
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,520
 Practically lots of things changed.

693
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,000
 I went from eating TV dinners and sleeping on a futon, and all of a sudden, it's like

694
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,280
 we have three meals a day, we have pillows, pillows, we got pillows everywhere.

695
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,200
 Anybody needs a pillow tonight, I got you, and then some.

696
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,600
 I used to be in a flag football league, men.

697
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,480
 Now I am a member of the Arboretum, and everything changes.

698
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,320
 Where you go changes, what you eat changes, what you do change, how you spend your time,

699
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,880
 because there's a new person, a new covenant.

700
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,040
 That's what Christianity says happens with somebody who's encountered Jesus.

701
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,200
 This is why some of you, you've come to know and trust in Jesus, and it's hard for you

702
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
 to go back.

703
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,320
 You know why that is?

704
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,240
 You find yourself, you want to go back to the club or go back to the bar and hang on

705
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
 Friday night, and it's like you can't even be who you used to be anymore.

706
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
 You can't even do it.

707
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,400
 You go to try to pick up a girl, and you're like, "Hey, girl, you have a Bible, and you

708
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,760
 can't even do it, because you have stepped into this relationship, and it has begun to

709
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
 change you."

710
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,440
 The God who's there is saying, "Man, I've got a hold on you.

711
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,800
 I am entering into a relationship with you, because this is about a person, not a process.

712
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,520
 For the rest of your days, I'm going to finish that work."

713
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,760
 That's why some of you are like, "Dude, I can't even do it anymore.

714
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,520
 I can't even do it with the same enjoyment that I used to be able to."

715
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,840
 Because Jesus has gotten a hold of your life.

716
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,040
 Some of you, this is why Christianity, you would say, never worked, because you thought

717
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,560
 it was about a process.

718
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,280
 Christianity is about being in a relationship with a person, and that is how change begins

719
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
 to come.

720
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,920
 The thing that's figured out in addition to that is something I've never really noticed

721
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,280
 before, and I was trying to explain this to someone earlier, and so hopefully this comes

722
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,480
 out clear.

723
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,320
 It says that Jesus came to seek and to save those who are lost.

724
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,680
 When I read that verse, I've always focused on, like, "Man, he came to save.

725
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,200
 That's what Jesus came to save, lost people."

726
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,360
 It tells us something about the heart of God.

727
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,280
 He came not just to save lost people.

728
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,820
 That is a very big part, and that is clearly a part.

729
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,040
 Kind of a two-part system, or two-part thing of why he said he came, but he came to seek.

730
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,840
 There's not a person on the planet that God has not been, since the moment they breathe

731
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,520
 their first breath, seeking.

732
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,480
 He's all about seeking lost people, which is everyone.

733
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,600
 As bad as Zacchaeus sought to know Jesus, Jesus was far more interested in knowing him.

734
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
 What do I mean by that?

735
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
 Think about it.

736
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,000
 Zacchaeus said, "Man, I'm willing to climb up and do whatever I have to in order to see

737
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Jesus."

738
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,300
 Zacchaeus said, "I'm willing to do whatever it takes, including die, in order to save

739
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
 Zacchaeus."

740
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,660
 Zacchaeus was willing to climb up a tree to see Jesus.

741
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,580
 Jesus was willing to die on a tree to save Zacchaeus.

742
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,220
 Zacchaeus said, "I'll give half of my money to the poor."

743
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,660
 Jesus said, "I'll give all of my life for you, Zacchaeus."

744
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,220
 Whatever you think, whatever link to which you think, "Man, I'm interested in knowing

745
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,180
 God," he is far more interested in knowing you.

746
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,780
 He is far more interested and far more seeking of you, because that's the heart of God.

747
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
 That's what he is.

748
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:04,220
 No matter how far people run and no matter if they run until they die, God is seeking

749
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,380
 after lost people to know him.

750
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,220
 He's seeking after, or he did seek after Hitler every day that he was alive.

751
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,380
 Seeking after every member of ISIS.

752
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,980
 He's seeking after every political person, depending on which side you fall, who seems

753
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
 like the enemy.

754
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:24,780
 I'll tell you what God's first and biggest concern with Joe Biden and Donald Trump is,

755
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
 Jesus.

756
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,580
 His biggest concern with you is the same concern that he had with Zacchaeus, is that you would

757
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
 know him.

758
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,860
 He's doing everything that he can to let you know that.

759
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:47,140
 The truth and the irony in that whole bag and weight situation is a funny thing, man.

760
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,780
 You take the bag out, and I've been told there's weight limits on the plane, so you can only

761
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,220
 bring certain amounts.

762
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,300
 They stack them in there, and they account for each person to weigh a certain amount.

763
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,260
 The reason I say it's ironic is it's still coming on the plane.

764
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,700
 I'm taking it out of that bag, and it's going in my backpack, and it's still going on the

765
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,700
 plane.

766
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
 Everyone knows that, right?

767
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,580
 We all good there?

768
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,500
 It's a little bit like, "Yeah, okay, I'll hold the socks.

769
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,300
 I guess I'll do that if that's going to really make this thing go down in the Pacific Ocean."

770
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
 It's still coming on.

771
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,460
 They may say there's a weight limit, and you can't get past here with that, or that's too

772
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
 much weight.

773
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,140
 You're going to have to carry that yourself, because we can't afford it.

774
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
 We can't hang in.

775
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,300
 We can't put that down there, not that weight.

776
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,060
 That is so unlike what Jesus says he is all about.

777
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,540
 In fact, he says the opposite.

778
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,900
 I'm going to close here.

779
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
 I'm laying on the plane.

780
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,740
 We're about to finish.

781
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,060
 He says the opposite is true.

782
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,580
 He says that it's not that, "Hey, you know, I'm going to carry most of it, but if there's

783
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,140
 any overages, then you're on your own.

784
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,580
 You've got to carry that onto the plane."

785
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,300
 He says, "I carry all of it or none of it.

786
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,980
 I carry every sin you've ever committed, everything messed up you've ever done, or I carry none

787
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,980
 of it."

788
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,260
 There's no you carry some and I carry some halfway, and you really work hard, and then

789
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,540
 we can have a relationship together.

790
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,420
 Jesus says, "I carry all of it or none of it."

791
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:17,140
 If you're going to have a relationship, it's going to involve you saying, "God, I surrender

792
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
 everything.

793
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,860
 You paid for every sin I've ever committed in my past, everything I've ever done in my

794
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,420
 present, everything I'm going to do in my future.

795
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,580
 You paid for all of it, God.

796
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,820
 I don't have to wonder anymore if I'm going to have eternal life.

797
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,820
 You paid for everything."

798
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,620
 That's what the message of Jesus says.

799
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,700
 It's not whosoever achieves can have eternal life.

800
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,580
 It's whosoever receives.

801
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,820
 Jesus has eternal life.

802
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,900
 The Bible says in Romans chapter five, verses six, seven, and eight, this.

803
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,260
 This is so huge, and so I'm going to land right here, because it's so applicable to

804
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,340
 all of us.

805
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,980
 Paul says, and he's writing this letter, and he says, "Let me tell you about what God did

806
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,780
 and when he did it for you.

807
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,260
 You see, at just the right time."

808
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,660
 What is the right time, Paul?

809
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:18,540
 When we were still powerless, when we couldn't obey God, we didn't want to obey God, we had

810
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,900
 nothing to offer but sin to God.

811
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:28,780
 Christ died for the ungodly.

812
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,100
 Very rarely will somebody die for a righteous person.

813
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,180
 So he begins to go into an analogy, "Though some for a good person might possibly dare

814
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
 to die."

815
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,540
 In other words, like, hey, most people won't die for somebody great, though every once

816
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,100
 in a while somebody dives on a grenade for a brother in the army, or somebody does something

817
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,620
 valiant and heroic.

818
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,180
 But God shows his love in this.

819
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:02,740
 While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

820
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,620
 The message of the Bible, the message of Zacchaeus is that all of us are like Zacchaeus.

821
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
 You are like Zacchaeus.

822
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,620
 You bring nothing to the table, and while you were powerless, the God of the universe

823
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,460
 said, "You know what time it is?

824
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,580
 It's the right time.

825
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,820
 When they can do nothing, they don't care about me, they're an enemy of God."

826
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,940
 God comes out and he says, "You know what I'm gonna do for my enemies?

827
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,260
 Die for them."

828
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,540
 There is no love like this that anyone has ever heard of, ever expressed.

829
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,140
 There's no other religion in all of the world.

830
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
 Let me land it right here.

831
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,700
 There's no other belief system that includes anything like the love that Paul just described

832
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,700
 here.

833
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,660
 The love that the page of the Bible expresses, and the love that Jesus demonstrated perfectly

834
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,660
 on the cross.

835
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,700
 There is no expression of Allah is love and he will die for his enemies.

836
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,980
 There's no other belief system in the world that says God is a God who goes out and dies

837
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
 for his enemies.

838
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,220
 Who says, "Hey, let's come to the battle line.

839
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
 Here's what we're gonna do.

840
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,500
 There's a war taking place.

841
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
 Here's the truth.

842
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
 I will die for all of you."

843
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,100
 There's no love the world has ever seen like that.

844
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,220
 And that the Bible says, and could it be true that the God who's there is a God who says,

845
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,300
 "You know what I do for those who can do nothing for me?

846
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:15,740
 I'm so in love with them that I will lay down my life for my enemies, let alone my friends

847
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,020
 or let alone some good people.

848
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:23,100
 For those who reject, who will always reject me, I still die for them."

849
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,420
 The God who's there has died for sinners like you, sinners like Zacchaeus, and sinners like

850
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,460
 me.

851
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,380
 Before anything was done, before you could do anything for him.

852
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,380
 Now my biggest fear is there are a lot of you in the room, candidly, you think you bring

853
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,380
 something and you have something to offer God.

854
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,540
 You're gonna do like, "Hey, you guys take that much luggage and I'm gonna carry on a

855
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,100
 little bit and I'm gonna do my part 'cause it makes me feel better and I feel like that'll

856
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,220
 keep me in relationship."

857
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,980
 And you have bought a lie.

858
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,460
 The message of the gospel is before you do anything right, before you could do anything

859
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:03,420
 right in order to have a relationship and be right with God, it takes you saying, "Man,

860
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,540
 I'm too broken and undeserving.

861
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,500
 I've fallen short of God's standard and I'm receiving.

862
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,180
 I'm not seeking to achieve anymore.

863
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,500
 I'm receiving what God did on my behalf."

864
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,780
 Jesus didn't come to give you what you deserve.

865
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,300
 He came to give you what he deserves.

866
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,620
 The message of Zacchaeus, the message of the New Testament, the message of the gospel and

867
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:33,180
 the God who's there is that you can have what he deserves, what Christ alone deserves.

868
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,540
 If you will just accept it by faith, "You paid for my sin.

869
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,700
 You died on the cross.

870
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,700
 You rose from the dead.

871
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,340
 You showed the check cleared.

872
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,900
 It was more than enough.

873
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,900
 And I'm not gonna believe and put my faith in what I do, how good I am, what I haven't

874
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,820
 done or what I did do.

875
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,900
 I'm not gonna let what I have done keep me out.

876
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,460
 I'm trusting in Jesus."

877
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:59,980
 And when you do, you, like Zacchaeus, become a child of Abraham, a child of faith, the

878
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:10,500
 one Jesus came in, like those of us who believe, to seek and to save.

879
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,900
 Let me pray.

880
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:29,620
 Father, I pray for any man or woman in this room who's never put their faith in what you

881
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,200
 did on the cross.

882
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,380
 You paid for their sin.

883
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,380
 You died in their place.

884
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,140
 You offer eternal life and you offer abundant life now.

885
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,460
 Tonight would be the moment that they would step off the ledge of trusting in themselves

886
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:49,580
 and step into a relationship with the God who's been reaching out in their direction

887
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,700
 all of their life.

888
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,380
 They wouldn't allow what they've done, their sins, how embarrassed they are, the shame,

889
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,280
 the guilt, all of those things that they feel like make them unworthy of having a relationship

890
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,180
 with God do anything other than drive them to you, the God who said, "I paid for all

891
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,380
 of it while they were still powerless, while they were still weak.

892
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,460
 I demonstrate my love.

893
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,900
 And yet while they were sinners, I died because I love them."

894
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:22,300
 Tonight would men and women receive that free gift?

895
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,140
 Would you help the parts in our hearts that still feel like we need to clean ourselves

896
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:32,420
 up and run from you in shame to be overtaken by the truths that we see in the New Testament?

897
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:38,060
 You are God who runs towards us and calls us to walk with you and experience life and

898
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,060
 freedom.

899
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,620
 May that message penetrate deeper into our hearts.

900
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,180
 Start with me, God.

901
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,180
 We worship you in song.

902
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,680
 Amen.

903
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:55,680
