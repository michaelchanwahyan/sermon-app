1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,440
 - What's up, Porch?

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,780
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,920
 Thank you, I paid that entire section to be here.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
 Guys, it is so good to be with you tonight.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,240
 My name is Josh Thames, and I have the wonderful privilege

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,560
 of being on the Porch team over in Fort Worth.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,520
 Welcome to all of you guys here in the room tonight,

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,560
 all of everyone listening online.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,500
 Guys, Phoenix, Phoenix started the Porch tonight.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,100
 Welcome, Phoenix.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,880
 They are living in the promised land,

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,320
 living in Arizona, and now the Porch is there.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,900
 I'm excited for them.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,800
 Guys, we are in an incredible series.

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,680
 I've enjoyed it called Self-Care,

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,040
 where we have taken a dive into a biblical look

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,440
 into what does it mean to care for our mind, soul,

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,560
 and our body, and tonight, tonight,

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,600
 we are talking about a subject

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,240
 that I am really passionate about.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,400
 I'm really passionate about it.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,280
 This is what this has looked like for me.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,400
 We're talking about what it looks like

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,440
 to care for your body, a biblical perspective

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,680
 on how to care for your body,

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,240
 and this has been something you guys need to know

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,820
 that for 25 years of my life that I didn't do right.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,320
 Like for 25 years, I was pretty sure

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,400
 that my body was just about me,

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,800
 and I sought affirmation really in two ways.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,480
 The first way was this, in just the way that I looked.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,400
 I sought affirmation in the way that I looked.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,320
 I was really excited about being fit from here to here,

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,920
 or really in the way that my body

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
 could perform as an athlete.

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
 That changed for me.

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,080
 Four years ago when I came here,

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,520
 and friends of mine, Bobby and Becca,

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,900
 asked me to jump into a ministry called Well.

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,100
 And in that ministry, we spent, myself and others,

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,460
 spent 12 weeks taking a deep dive into God's word,

43
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,180
 and what does it have to say about our bodies.

44
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,140
 And it changed my life.

45
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,520
 I began to learn for the first time

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,820
 that my body was not my own,

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,940
 that it was given to me by God,

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,440
 and instead of for my glory, actually for his.

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,780
 And so at the end of 12 weeks,

50
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,480
 not only was I more physically healthy,

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,880
 there was a healthiness between me

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,460
 and my relationship with God, just personally,

53
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,620
 as I began to see what that looked like.

54
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,280
 And here's why I'm excited about it.

55
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,860
 Really, there's two reasons.

56
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,060
 And the first one is this,

57
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,580
 is I don't think that we have done an excellent job

58
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,560
 talking about this subject.

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,980
 I mean, it, in a lot of ways, is kind of taboo.

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,460
 I mean, we'll talk about pornography,

61
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,240
 and we'll talk about drug addiction and alcohol abuse,

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,620
 but talking about our bodies is just something

63
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,260
 that I frankly don't think we have done

64
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,380
 an excellent job about.

65
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,300
 And then the second reason is this,

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,100
 is that each one of us has a relationship with this topic.

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,980
 Each one of us has a relationship with the topic

68
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,820
 of how to care for your body,

69
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,220
 because each one of us has a body.

70
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,860
 Every person in here.

71
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,500
 So this is, whether or not you've thought about it well,

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,900
 or you haven't, each one of us has a body,

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,380
 each have a relationship with how we view,

74
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,820
 treat it, and care for it.

75
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,380
 And so here's the thing.

76
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,980
 I think our culture is telling us

77
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,860
 there really seems to be two extremes.

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,660
 Two extremes here in our view of the body.

79
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,340
 One extreme is like, hey, you're obsessed with working out

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,260
 and making your body look a certain way, right?

81
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,460
 Hashtag fit fam, or motivation.

82
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,660
 This is not motivation, it's demotivating.

83
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,220
 And then the other camp is this.

84
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
 The other camp is really like,

85
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,500
 hey, you just like love for you for you, you know?

86
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,460
 Like, the way you're made is great.

87
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,540
 Like get somebody like self-love,

88
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
 curves of the new beautiful, right?

89
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,000
 You can't body shame me.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,820
 There seems to be like really two camps here.

91
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,040
 And I don't know if you may end up on one of those extremes,

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,700
 but it just seems the problem with both of those

93
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,380
 is that they center around us and not around God.

94
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,820
 And you're gonna be like,

95
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,420
 well, I don't land in either one of those extremes,

96
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,940
 but I do think that if you pay attention tonight

97
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,660
 that there's things inside of God's word

98
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,500
 that are going to help you

99
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,460
 in how you view and care for your body.

100
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,800
 God cares that we are healthy.

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,340
 He cares about our fitness,

102
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,480
 but I think differently than the way you and I care.

103
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,500
 We're gonna be taking a look at what the world says

104
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,420
 about this topic, what the world says,

105
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,900
 what the word says, and then how to,

106
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,020
 how to care for our bodies

107
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,660
 in light of what God's word has to say.

108
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,820
 And so if you have your Bibles,

109
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,260
 you guys can open those up to 1 Corinthians.

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,140
 1 Corinthians 6 verses 19 and 20.

111
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,860
 This is Paul writing to the church in Corinth.

112
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,060
 And so it should be up here on the screen

113
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,620
 and I'll read it to us.

114
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,940
 He says this, "Or do you not know

115
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,300
 that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,

116
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,580
 whom you have from God?

117
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,220
 You are not your own,

118
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,820
 for you were bought with a price.

119
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,700
 So glorify God in your body."

120
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,840
 In context, Paul is warning against the use of our body

121
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,700
 in sexual sin, but he says some pretty crazy things here.

122
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,780
 He says, one, that our bodies are a dwelling place

123
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,100
 for the Holy Spirit.

124
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,580
 And then that our bodies are not our own,

125
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,620
 they're actually God's.

126
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,680
 And because they are God's,

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,900
 our bodies are meant to bring him glory and not us.

128
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,820
 My first point this evening is this,

129
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,820
 the world says to worship our bodies as God.

130
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,460
 And when I say worship, I don't mean

131
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,020
 what just happened here with the lights low

132
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,500
 and our hands up high,

133
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,220
 but what I mean by worship is to love, admire,

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,580
 and to care for something very, very much,

135
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,220
 and to make something that God in your life

136
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,380
 is to mean your world centers around it.

137
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,060
 Right, that it's kind of everything to you.

138
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,020
 The world is telling us to worship our bodies as God.

139
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,980
 I mean, it's almost as if everything around you

140
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,900
 is telling you that what you look like is everything.

141
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,120
 We see this, it doesn't take long to see this play out.

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,820
 TVs reinforce this, movies reinforce this,

143
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,060
 pornography reinforces this,

144
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,340
 the billboards that we drive by reinforces this,

145
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,460
 fitness blogs and models are literally making a living

146
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,440
 because of the way that they look.

147
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,020
 Our world is telling us to worship our bodies as God.

148
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,820
 And we also say that if we worship,

149
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,100
 if you worship your body good enough,

150
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,380
 we're gonna worship you as God.

151
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,020
 You don't believe me, I'll prove it to you.

152
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,020
 Anyone in here know the name Harrison Schmidt?

153
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,700
 Harrison Schmidt, anyone?

154
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,820
 Harrison Schmidt was the last man to walk on the moon.

155
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,380
 Like there's been 12 total people,

156
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,620
 Harrison Schmidt being one of them

157
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,940
 that ever have walked on the moon.

158
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,580
 You have to imagine that as he's walking around up there,

159
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,100
 you know, like I don't know how that like looked,

160
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,540
 it had to have been amazing, you know, he's like,

161
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,260
 I can't wait to be a household name.

162
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,620
 Like I'm never paying for a meal or drink

163
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,700
 for the rest of my life, right?

164
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,020
 Yeah, I'm gonna be a household name.

165
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,340
 People are gonna name their kids after me.

166
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,020
 It's going to be amazing.

167
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,780
 You know what is a household name?

168
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,940
 Kim Kardashian.

169
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,700
 Gotcha, yeah, why?

170
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,700
 Because of how she looks.

171
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,380
 But I mean, she hasn't done anything like amazing,

172
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,380
 she hasn't created something,

173
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,180
 she's not like flipping houses down in Waco.

174
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,500
 I mean, literally because of the way that she looks,

175
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,420
 we know her, right?

176
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,660
 So in like the famous club, who's gonna be famous?

177
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,100
 Who's gonna be a household name club?

178
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,300
 They're like, walk on the moon, meh, got a big butt.

179
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,740
 Yep, you're in, right?

180
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,620
 I mean, it's crazy.

181
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,820
 It's crazy the world that we live in.

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,140
 We were literally saying, hey,

183
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,740
 if you worship your body as God,

184
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,180
 good enough, I'm gonna worship you as God.

185
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,500
 It's craziness.

186
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,300
 It's craziness and it's affecting all of us.

187
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,260
 We're buying into this way of thinking.

188
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,780
 Cosmetic surgeries are up 200% since the year 2000.

189
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,060
 Surgery, surgeries that are enhancing the way

190
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,940
 that you look and enhancing your physical features

191
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,020
 have become normal today.

192
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,580
 They've become normal.

193
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,580
 What we choose to post on social media shows us this.

194
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,740
 Like, I'm gonna post that 'cause I look great, right?

195
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,180
 What we choose to not post on social media proves this.

196
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,940
 We are buying into the lie that we are meant

197
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,020
 to worship our bodies as God.

198
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,620
 Here's another thing.

199
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,060
 Another way I know this for a fact is when you go,

200
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,820
 a lot of us are hiring personal trainers

201
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,060
 and I don't know if you guys have ever,

202
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,980
 some of you may have not,

203
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,900
 but when you, there's a classic question they ask you

204
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,540
 which is, "Hey, what are your goals?"

205
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,220
 And it's like, "To be hot?"

206
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,420
 Right?

207
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,540
 Six pack would be good.

208
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,500
 How much would an eight pack cost me?

209
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,540
 Right, I mean, it's one thing.

210
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,420
 And so what I'm trying to do here is to show you

211
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,180
 that it is clear that in God's word,

212
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,100
 the temple being our bodies that he's talking about,

213
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,740
 which is a place where we go to worship.

214
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,220
 Instead of worshiping in this place,

215
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,380
 the world is telling us to worship the place,

216
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,540
 the temple itself.

217
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,260
 Instead of worshiping in the temple,

218
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,980
 we are worshiping our bodies.

219
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,160
 If you invest into your body,

220
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,300
 you're investing in something that's depreciating.

221
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,780
 Like it's going away.

222
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,500
 Like gravity wins, people.

223
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,780
 Like, I don't know if you know this.

224
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,060
 I had a friend tell me this recently.

225
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
 He said, "Hey, when you wanna think about

226
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,640
 "what you're gonna look like when you get older,

227
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,820
 "like don't pick up a magazine.

228
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,300
 "Like go to like an old photo album

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,740
 "and find like your grandma.

230
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,260
 "Like that's where you're headed."

231
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,740
 Right?

232
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,580
 That's where you're headed.

233
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,460
 And it'd be if in 2013, your friend said,

234
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,300
 "Hey, you know what?

235
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,780
 "We should all invest all of our money into Vine."

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,100
 Which now as we know, 2019 is like extinct, gone.

237
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,540
 People, you investing in your body, caring for your body.

238
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,300
 Wait, if you do that, if you make that your world,

239
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,040
 if you make that what your world is centered around,

240
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
 you're investing in something that is depreciating.

241
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,640
 Here's the thing, we are left empty and insecure.

242
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,920
 Because whether you have decided you're going to work hard

243
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
 to make your body look a certain way,

244
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,640
 or you've found a way to rationalize inside your mind,

245
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,960
 like, ah, just like doesn't matter what I look like.

246
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,700
 I don't care what people think.

247
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,800
 Both of those are leaving us broken and hurt and insecure.

248
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,900
 It used to be magazines.

249
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,480
 Used to be magazines, but all of us know

250
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,400
 those are like, you know, Photoshopped,

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,360
 electronically enhanced.

252
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,780
 Now, it's your social media.

253
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,080
 Now it's your Instagram feed.

254
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
 Now like the normal people in your life

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,320
 look better than you do, right?

256
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,960
 I mean, I don't know how everyone is so tan toned

257
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,940
 to eat pizza and like live in their like VW camper vans

258
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,780
 on a beach, right?

259
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,680
 I mean, it's crazy.

260
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
 Like what seems to be the normal,

261
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,360
 what's on your phone is proving to you,

262
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,860
 or it seems as if like that should be what I look like.

263
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,000
 And I don't look like that.

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,960
 What's wrong?

265
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,380
 Here's the thing.

266
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,320
 If we are worshiping our bodies of God,

267
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
 we are finding our worth.

268
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
 We find our worth in what we worship.

269
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,920
 If what you worship is money,

270
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,040
 then the number in your bank account

271
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,560
 is where you're going to find your significance.

272
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,920
 But if you worship your body and you find your worth

273
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
 in what you look like, it's dangerous

274
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,760
 'cause it's going down.

275
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,280
 And here's a good way to tell if you have bought into this.

276
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,440
 If you are worshiping your body as God,

277
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,280
 if your mood changes,

278
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,640
 if your mood changes,

279
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,880
 if your mood changes,

280
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,840
 depending on like what you look like that day,

281
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,000
 maybe like there's a pimple on your face

282
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,040
 and you're like, "Hey, what are you looking at?"

283
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,960
 And no one even knows it's there.

284
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,160
 Maybe it's like you had a bad hair day

285
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,000
 or possibly it's a number on a scale.

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,620
 If your mood changes because of either how you look like

287
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,560
 or a number on the scale,

288
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
 that is a telltale sign for you

289
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,240
 that you are worshiping your body

290
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
 as God.

291
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,140
 Yeah, it just seems that there's really two responses

292
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,040
 to the world's message.

293
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,320
 And that is those who accept it and those who avoid it.

294
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,840
 And those of us who accept it,

295
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,320
 we make our life about working out

296
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
 and the way that our bodies look.

297
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,620
 And those of us who avoid it, we just rationalize,

298
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,740
 but we're insecure.

299
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,160
 Am I saying that it's wrong to be super fit?

300
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,260
 No, I'm not.

301
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,800
 Am I saying that it's wrong to be comfortable

302
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,760
 in your own skin?

303
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,700
 No, but what I am saying is the Bible speaks

304
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,420
 to the heart behind both of them.

305
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,140
 The Bible speaks, these verses speak to the heart

306
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,220
 behind both of them.

307
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,260
 And so my second point is this,

308
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,220
 if the world says to worship our body as God,

309
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,520
 the word says to worship God with your body.

310
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,020
 I'm literally just gonna read these verses again.

311
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,860
 It says this, "Or do you not know that your body

312
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,900
 "is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,

313
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,100
 "whom you have from God?"

314
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
 I don't think we get this, guys.

315
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,800
 If you have trusted in Christ,

316
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,400
 God has decided that your body is going to be the place

317
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,940
 where his spirit lives.

318
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,040
 It says, "You are not your own,

319
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,540
 "for you were bought with a price,

320
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,380
 "so glorify God in your body."

321
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,700
 You see, God did not only created you and gave you your body,

322
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,840
 he bought you back at the infinite cost of his own son.

323
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,700
 So he emphatically means for you to worship him

324
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,580
 with the body that he's given you.

325
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,500
 And so what these verses are really saying

326
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,600
 is that how we care for our bodies is a stewardship issue.

327
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,080
 Your body is not your own, it's a gift.

328
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,320
 It's for God's glory and not for yours.

329
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,180
 And we have a great responsibility to steward it.

330
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,240
 You may be wondering, what is a steward?

331
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,080
 When I think about this,

332
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,360
 here's a good illustration for being a steward.

333
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
 I have a 403B, which is 401K for pastors, okay?

334
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,360
 And if I went and found the guy that's investing my money,

335
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,960
 who's taking care of my 403B,

336
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,880
 and said, "Hey man, I'm here for my money."

337
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
 You got it, he's like, "Yeah, your money."

338
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,920
 Wow, where did I put that?

339
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,360
 Right, I think it's around here somewhere.

340
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,920
 Like I would say, "Cool, I'm gonna take my money,

341
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,740
 "I'm going to have,

342
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,500
 "I'm going to give that to a different steward,

343
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,920
 "someone who is better at taking care of it.

344
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,560
 "It's money that's not his,

345
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,060
 "but he is responsible for taking care of it."

346
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,400
 That's what I mean when I say

347
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,960
 that you are a steward of your body.

348
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,120
 It's not your own,

349
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,460
 but you are responsible for caring for it.

350
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,520
 You're responsible for how you view it,

351
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,560
 for how you use it, how you treat it.

352
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,400
 God made the body that you have.

353
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,920
 Some of you need to know, when you think about this,

354
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,780
 there are ways in which you have not been excited

355
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,020
 on how God has made you.

356
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,740
 And you need to know this, this is Psalm 139.

357
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,740
 He says, "For you have formed my inward parts.

358
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,980
 "You have knitted me together in my mother's womb.

359
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,660
 "I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

360
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,220
 "Wonderful are your works.

361
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,060
 "My soul knows it very well."

362
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,380
 Guys, you are the pinnacle of his creation.

363
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
 When God made everything that you see,

364
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,580
 he said that you were the only ones made.

365
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,400
 You and I as humans were made in his image.

366
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,460
 The very best, all the beautiful things in this world

367
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,860
 that you've seen, the trees, the birds,

368
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,160
 everything that's amazing, he says,

369
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,900
 you are the very peak of that creation

370
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,060
 and you are beautiful and wonderfully made.

371
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:57,180
 And he didn't mess up on you.

372
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,300
 And he made us all different.

373
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,580
 We look different, we have different abilities.

374
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,140
 Friends, I know this very well.

375
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,940
 I know that we look different,

376
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,780
 that we have different abilities.

377
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,140
 Two friends of mine last year went to

378
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,300
 one of my favorite places in the world

379
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,140
 and it's called Havasu Falls.

380
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,660
 Havasu Falls is a part of the Grand Canyon.

381
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,220
 It's in Arizona and it's an incredible place

382
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,020
 and it's quite the hike to get down there.

383
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,460
 It's about a 10-mile hike down, 10-mile hike out.

384
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,140
 And both of these friends, they look different than I.

385
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,780
 And so we are on the hike down, it's not so bad

386
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,820
 'cause we're headed down.

387
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,740
 On the way out though, my friend Andre is in the front

388
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,180
 and then my friend Ryan, and I noticed something.

389
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,260
 I noticed that we have differing abilities

390
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,980
 because as they were walking,

391
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,180
 I was walking at exactly the same pace as they were,

392
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
 but I was losing about six inches every step, right?

393
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
 Like, I'm like, this is a problem, people,

394
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,600
 because now not only are my legs having to work

395
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,820
 to keep up with them, my lungs are dying, right?

396
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,380
 And so there's just a difference

397
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,520
 in the way that we were made, but that's okay.

398
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,900
 Their worth, because they're made that way,

399
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,480
 isn't any more than mine.

400
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,180
 God made all of us in his image.

401
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,220
 God has made all of us in his image

402
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,220
 and God didn't give me their body to steward.

403
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,740
 God didn't give me yours, he didn't give you theirs.

404
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,740
 The person on your Instagram, he gave you yours

405
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,980
 in the way that he has made you

406
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,780
 is fearfully and wonderfully made.

407
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,220
 And you need to remember that.

408
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,860
 Some of you just need to sit in that.

409
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,980
 First Samuel 16, seven says that the man looks

410
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,860
 on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart.

411
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,700
 God cares about your health and fitness

412
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:48,220
 because the body he gave you is actually his.

413
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,420
 It's the only body that he's given you to serve him

414
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,540
 as much as you can, as long as you can.

415
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,620
 And you are the only person in this world

416
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,980
 that can steward the body that you've got for God's glory

417
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,900
 and not something else.

418
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,420
 And instead of making our bodies what we are worshiping,

419
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,020
 making our bodies God, the word says

420
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,160
 to worship God with your body.

421
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,980
 Some of you might be thinking, man, Josh,

422
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,340
 I don't know, how do I do this?

423
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,180
 How do I do this?

424
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,300
 If it's really true that my body is not my own,

425
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,780
 that it was given to me by God for his glory

426
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,260
 and not my own, one, there's probably a view,

427
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,020
 the way in which you view your body tonight,

428
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,380
 I hope it changes.

429
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,460
 Friends, I hope what you hear me saying

430
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,420
 is that I'm not mad or frustrated.

431
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,380
 I'm not here to be angry at you

432
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,660
 or tell you that God's angry at you,

433
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,020
 but to tell you that your body is not yours.

434
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,540
 It was made for God in his glory.

435
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,780
 That could have an impact on some of you.

436
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,700
 Some of you may need to get out of the gym.

437
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,900
 Some of you may need to stop going to the gym

438
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,260
 because you are going there to make your body

439
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,020
 look a certain way so that you will gain affirmation

440
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,860
 from it.

441
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,180
 And then some of you may need to get into the gym

442
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,340
 for the very first time because God cares.

443
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,460
 God cares about your health and your fitness.

444
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,860
 And he's given you a body to serve him

445
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,620
 as long as you can, as much as you can.

446
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,060
 And so I want to be really practical with you guys tonight

447
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,740
 to give you a few ways in which you can do that.

448
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,620
 A few just simple how-to's.

449
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,900
 And the first one is this, is to train.

450
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,460
 Train your body through movement.

451
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,220
 Now, if you're in here tonight and you're a mailman

452
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,340
 and you walk 10 miles today, hey, good on you.

453
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,180
 You're good.

454
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,240
 You've used your body, you've moved your body today.

455
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,080
 But if we're really honest,

456
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,900
 all of society has made a more inactive

457
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,140
 and sedentary lifestyle normal, right?

458
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,220
 A lot of us are sitting at a desk for most of the day

459
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,740
 and God did not design your body to be inactive.

460
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
 He has actually designed it to move.

461
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,160
 And so I can't tell you what type or how much,

462
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,820
 what type of workout or how much you need to work out

463
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,980
 that you would be a good sewer.

464
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,900
 But I, and I'm not saying that it's required to work out

465
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,620
 to be a good sewer, but I am saying

466
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,980
 that if you leave your body inactive,

467
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,840
 you are being a bad steward.

468
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,560
 It was never meant to be inactive.

469
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,240
 And so for some of you,

470
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,960
 the most honoring thing that you can do tomorrow

471
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,960
 is to set your alarm, get up and go run a mile, right?

472
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,920
 Some of you, the most God honoring thing that you could do

473
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,580
 is to get up, spend time reading your Bible

474
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,200
 and remember that your identity and worth

475
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,180
 is not found in how your body looks.

476
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,600
 So, I mean, I don't know what that looks like for you.

477
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,140
 I can't tell you a good principle is three times a week.

478
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,600
 Do that, just like start at three times a week.

479
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,900
 Train your body through movement three times a week.

480
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,880
 Find a movement or something,

481
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,140
 a workout that you like, that you enjoy.

482
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,160
 Some of you might be like, man,

483
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,620
 I don't even know what to do anymore.

484
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,560
 Like what kind of working out should I do?

485
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,080
 Is it, you know, should I run

486
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,560
 or should I do Pilates or any of that?

487
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,400
 Is it CrossFit?

488
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
 And yes, the answer is CrossFit.

489
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,680
 I'm kidding.

490
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
 (congregation laughing)

491
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,360
 But kind of, no.

492
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,520
 But I am saying like, God has designed your body to move.

493
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,040
 And when you leave it inactive,

494
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,880
 you are actually taking away from the health

495
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,840
 that God has meant for you to live in.

496
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,120
 And you are not worshiping him as well as you could.

497
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,420
 And the next one is this.

498
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,440
 So if it train, train your body through movement.

499
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,920
 The next one is this, eat with purpose.

500
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,360
 Eat with purpose.

501
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,080
 And here's what I mean by that is,

502
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,400
 we know that God's primary reason for food was for fuel,

503
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
 literally to keep us alive.

504
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,200
 Like that is the primary reason,

505
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,800
 but he also made it for pleasure.

506
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,520
 I mean, we all know how worshipful

507
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,760
 eating a honey butter chicken biscuit can be.

508
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,020
 (congregation laughing)

509
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,920
 No, I need an amen, yes?

510
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,320
 Yeah, we know.

511
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,160
 And that's okay.

512
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,600
 And we know that meals often are a great time

513
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
 of like fellowship,

514
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,660
 like food is meant to bring enjoyment and pleasure,

515
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,500
 and that's a good thing.

516
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,040
 But what I'm asking is that you eat on purpose.

517
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,840
 That if every time, if you find yourself,

518
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,920
 every time you're in a certain mood,

519
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,760
 you're a little bit down,

520
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,400
 you're turning to Blue Bell ice cream.

521
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,480
 Hey, that's maybe not it, right?

522
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,180
 To know how different foods affect your body.

523
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,400
 And I would even go as far as just to say,

524
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,400
 hey, eat more for fuel over pleasure,

525
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,040
 or even how it tastes.

526
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,340
 Some of you are mad at me, including my wife.

527
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,540
 Eat for fuel over pleasure.

528
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,920
 Here's three principles there that I got told

529
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,800
 that have been helpful for me

530
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,680
 that could be helpful to you guys,

531
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,680
 and it's this, eat real food, not too much, mostly greens.

532
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,880
 It's a great principle.

533
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,480
 When you think about how you eat,

534
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,200
 eating on purpose in a way that it'll feel your body,

535
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,200
 think about just eat real food, not too much, mostly greens.

536
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,080
 And so train your body through movement.

537
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,600
 Eat with purpose.

538
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,340
 And then this last one is this, sleep.

539
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,360
 Sleep, because your body needs it.

540
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,480
 Yes, hey, we live, hey, our current culture

541
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,880
 is telling us, man, you've gotta get up,

542
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,280
 you've gotta be a hustler.

543
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,120
 You know what I mean?

544
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,940
 It's hard.

545
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,700
 I am here, I will tell you that sleep is difficult for me.

546
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,320
 There just seems like there's so many things,

547
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,600
 sometimes 'cause I'm just a little excited

548
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,080
 and I wanna do everything,

549
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,880
 and then other times it's just because

550
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,920
 I believe it rests on my shoulders,

551
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,160
 that if I, like sleeping means

552
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,480
 something's not going to happen.

553
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,360
 And so not only does your body need it,

554
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,360
 not only is that meant to be where your body recovers,

555
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,600
 but it's a trust issue as well, people.

556
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,080
 Like when you go to bed at night, it is a trust issue,

557
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,600
 knowing that if I go to sleep right now,

558
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,420
 even though all the world around me feels like

559
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,080
 I need to do all of these things,

560
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,960
 when I go to sleep, I'm telling God, like,

561
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,560
 hey, I know that you don't need me to do anything,

562
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,960
 that you're big enough, that you've got it under control.

563
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,320
 And so sleep and sleep well.

564
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
 Here's some of the ways that that played out for us

565
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,440
 in this ministry called, well,

566
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,160
 when we were thinking about eating on purpose,

567
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
 we did a sugar challenge.

568
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
 And some of you, this could be a good principle

569
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,040
 for you to start with tonight.

570
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,080
 The sugar challenge is this, for 30 days,

571
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,120
 no sugar, literally that.

572
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
 Okay, you didn't get to eat sugar, not 30 days, two weeks,

573
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,140
 y'all thought I was crazy.

574
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,120
 Two weeks, no sugar, right?

575
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,400
 And then, and here's what it looked like,

576
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
 if you ate sugar, if you showed up to group the next day

577
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,520
 and you had eaten sugar, it cost 10 burpees.

578
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,400
 It didn't cost you 10 burpees,

579
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,360
 it cost everyone else 10 burpees.

580
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,720
 And so you got to be that guy like, I'm sorry, team,

581
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,600
 the cake was awesome, right?

582
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,760
 But just that discipline, the discipline

583
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
 to stay away from sugar is incredibly hard.

584
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,880
 And that could be a good thing just for you to start.

585
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,600
 It's like, hey, I'm gonna go on a sugar fast.

586
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,440
 I'm gonna tell my friends, hey,

587
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,640
 we're gonna go two weeks sugar fast.

588
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,720
 At the end of that, we'll do as many burpees

589
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,220
 as many times as we ate sugar.

590
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,480
 It's scary, try it.

591
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,240
 Yeah, the other one is this, we had a sleep challenge.

592
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,720
 We had a sleep challenge where we had to be in bed

593
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,700
 at least eight hours.

594
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,200
 Eight hours, you guys are like, this is craziness.

595
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,960
 And on top of that, not only you couldn't have any type

596
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,160
 of caffeine, including chocolate four hours

597
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,240
 before you went to bed, okay?

598
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,320
 And then you couldn't look at your phone four hours

599
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
 before you went to bed because that little blue light

600
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,640
 inside your phone, it actually stimulates your brain

601
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,400
 and keeps you awake.

602
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,720
 And so we did a sleep challenge there

603
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,040
 that was just so helpful for me because one,

604
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,980
 I began to realize how attached to my phone I was.

605
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,560
 And then also just through, I began to realize

606
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,840
 like how well I was not taking care of the body

607
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,500
 that God has given me because I just wasn't sleeping.

608
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,040
 I just wasn't sleeping.

609
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,180
 And so again, to run through this,

610
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,860
 you guys train through movement.

611
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,400
 Don't be inactive, eat with purpose and sleep

612
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,600
 because your body needs it.

613
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,520
 We worship God with our body when we understand

614
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
 that it is His.

615
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,720
 It's where He abides.

616
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
 Holy Spirit lives inside of us.

617
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,360
 And so the way that we steward it,

618
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,920
 the way that we think about how we use it,

619
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,320
 it's no longer how it's going to make us feel

620
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,280
 or how it's going to make us look,

621
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,120
 but is it going to be honoring to God?

622
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,240
 I don't know what faithfulness looks like for you,

623
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,680
 but I am asking you to begin to understand

624
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,980
 that your body's a gift.

625
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,720
 It is made by God, for God, it is made on purpose.

626
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,320
 There's a show that I love to watch.

627
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,320
 I bet many of you guys know, and it's called "The Voice."

628
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,200
 The Voice fans in here, yes, it's amazing.

629
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,080
 In here, "The Voice" is incredible.

630
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,980
 If you guys don't know, it's a show where people can come

631
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,560
 and use their voices to hopefully land deals

632
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,520
 with all of these famous people.

633
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,760
 And it's pretty amazing because they've taken something

634
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,440
 away from the judges that's not normally taken away.

635
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,240
 They got all of the judges,

636
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,000
 they're going to listen to this person sing,

637
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,880
 but the judges are facing the opposite direction.

638
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,240
 Like they can't see the person at all.

639
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,200
 And so you've got, you know, Adam and Christina

640
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,560
 and Blake down there, like listening, like,

641
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,160
 "Hey, you guys, do you hear it, man?

642
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,800
 Wow, their voice is amazing."

643
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,120
 And you're going to touch your button,

644
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,360
 you're going to turn around,

645
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,680
 you're going to turn around and pick this person,

646
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,200
 say you want them on their team.

647
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
 What's awesome about it is that it has nothing to do

648
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
 with their looks at all.

649
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,960
 They don't know what they look like.

650
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,280
 They just are, they're basing, if they want them,

651
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,640
 on their abilities and what they can do and on their voice.

652
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,640
 And I think guys, that's similar to how God looks at us.

653
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,580
 That's similar to how God treats us.

654
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,840
 It's not about the way that we look.

655
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,680
 He doesn't, he's not worried about us on the outside.

656
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,720
 What has actually happened is God knows you,

657
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,480
 has made you in his image.

658
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,160
 And because he loves you, because he wants you,

659
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 he has hit the button and turned around on you

660
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,220
 to choose you.

661
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,560
 And if you don't know, if you don't know this God,

662
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,100
 this God that has made you in his image, I want you to.

663
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,360
 He's made you because he loves you.

664
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,920
 And even though we, all of us are broken,

665
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,640
 it's the greatest love story ever

666
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,540
 because in the midst of when God made us,

667
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,880
 we at one point in our lives said,

668
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,160
 "Hey God, I know you made us to be

669
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,500
 "in a right relationship with you,

670
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,440
 "but we're gonna choose to go our own ways."

671
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,560
 And this really amazing, terrible thing happened.

672
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,400
 It's sin, sin entered the world

673
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,900
 and it broke the relationship you and I

674
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,280
 were meant to have with God.

675
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,880
 It's what causes our relationship with our bodies

676
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,560
 to be broken is this thing called sin.

677
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,880
 And the Bible tells us that all of us have sinned

678
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,920
 and that sin deserves death.

679
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,560
 But then God, in his love for us, sent his only son

680
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,360
 to come and live on this earth, to live perfectly.

681
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,880
 And then for all the ways that we have sinned against him,

682
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,880
 to die on a cross, literally a robber's death,

683
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,860
 he carried the sin.

684
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,080
 He bore the sin, he paid for the sin on the death

685
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,480
 when he died on the cross and he rose again

686
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,280
 three days later, conquering the death

687
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,440
 so that you and I can be restored

688
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
 back into a right relationship with God.

689
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,520
 That's the God that's made you in his image.

690
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
 That's the God that's given you,

691
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
 each of you, your unique body.

692
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,600
 And he has made you to glorify him in it.

693
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,400
 The world says that you are at the center of your body

694
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,280
 and its image is your value.

695
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,480
 God's word says that God has made you in his image

696
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,880
 and that you are invaluable.

697
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,120
 I'm gonna pray for us.

698
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,920
 Father, we are thankful for you.

699
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:37,840
 And I just ask that you would open the eyes of our hearts,

700
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,600
 Father, to recognize your incredible love for us

701
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,120
 and our deep and desperate need for you.

702
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,440
 And Father, I repent of the ways in which I have treated

703
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,300
 and used my body for my own glory and not for you.

704
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,400
 And I pray for all of my friends in this room,

705
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,240
 Father, that maybe if this is the first time

706
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,120
 that they have recognized or heard and understood

707
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,600
 that, man, this body, this temple that you've given them

708
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,080
 is not meant for their glory, but for yours,

709
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,300
 Father, just change their hearts.

710
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,680
 And may we be people that are identified,

711
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,460
 not in how we look, but are identified

712
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,800
 by the love that you have given us.

713
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,700
 You have died on the cross and now,

714
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,600
 if we have put our faith in Jesus,

715
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,480
 you now identify us as sons and daughters.

716
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,280
 Thank you again for this evening

717
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,240
 and the fact that we can open your word up freely

718
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,160
 and we can begin to learn how you would have us live.

719
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,360
 It's in your holy and precious name that I pray, amen.

720
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,520
 - Man, thank you, Josh.

721
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,160
 It was awesome and encouraging.

722
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,960
 And from just a brother who spent years

723
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,880
 helping people experience what God wants us to experience

724
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,800
 as it relates to wellness and health,

725
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,440
 not for the sake of vanity,

726
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,760
 but for the sake of bringing honor to him

727
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,520
 and experiencing part of the abundant life that's here.

728
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,400
 Some of you in the room,

729
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,960
 the most important thing that you need

730
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,460
 to walk away with tonight

731
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,420
 is not that you need to wake up tomorrow morning

732
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,080
 and go do CrossFit or go do Camp Gladiator

733
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,380
 or go do whatever is in your regimen.

734
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,760
 It's that you need to stop focusing on the outside

735
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,360
 because there is a hole on the inside

736
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,320
 that you have never addressed.

737
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,400
 And you have tried to fill it with different substances,

738
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 with different people, with working out, with money.

739
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,920
 And it is a hole that God, the eternal creator,

740
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,600
 said, "I placed eternity in the hearts of men,"

741
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,480
 Ecclesiastes chapter three said.

742
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
 A hole that God placed inside of you

743
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,680
 so that you would reach out and find him.

744
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,240
 And the thing more than anything else that you need tonight

745
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,240
 is not an encouragement to go get fit

746
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,720
 and let's all get a six pack in 2019.

747
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,040
 What you need is to accept the free gift

748
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,560
 that the God who is so crazy about you,

749
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,520
 that he gave his own life for you,

750
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,600
 despite everything that he knows,

751
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
 everything broken about you, it's no mystery to him.

752
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,920
 And yet before you ever breathed your first breath,

753
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,940
 he was reaching out arms for you.

754
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,040
 It is the thing you came into this world

755
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,520
 craving, needing, wanting most.

756
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,080
 It is the thing that on your dying deathbed

757
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,200
 with your last breaths, you will most need.

758
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,600
 And tonight is your night.

759
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,880
 And he's offering the eternal gift,

760
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,280
 the gift of eternal life, if you will just by faith.

761
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,240
 Say, "God, I'm not trusting in what I do.

762
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,680
 "I'm not trusting how good I am.

763
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,760
 "I'm trusting in Jesus.

764
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,340
 "I got no shot but him."

765
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,640
 And if you're ever gonna experience eternal life

766
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,840
 and the abundant life in this planet,

767
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,320
 it won't happen by you going to 24-hour fitness more.

768
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,480
 It's gonna happen by you walking with Jesus.

769
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,180
 And that is the message you need to walk away with tonight.

770
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,720
 Others of you, you don't need to accept the truth

771
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
 'cause you already have.

772
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,040
 But you have bought in some of the lies

773
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,500
 that the world is selling you every single day.

774
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,680
 Lies about who you are, lies about where your worth is,

775
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,600
 lies about what beauty is, and you hate yourself.

776
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,800
 And you look amazing.

777
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,300
 On the outside, no one would ever know it.

778
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,560
 You got it all together.

779
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,160
 You're the prettiest girl or handsome,

780
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,760
 most handsome guy in your whole crew.

781
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,280
 And you're the person crushing every workout regimen.

782
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,880
 But you have bought lies

783
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,960
 as it relates to where your value is.

784
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
 And tonight, the challenge,

785
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,160
 and everything in addition to what Josh said,

786
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,680
 which was so encouraging and so helpful,

787
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,240
 what you need to do is speak the truth to yourself.

788
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,400
 You need to speak the truth.

789
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,460
 Some of you, I don't know what that is,

790
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,920
 but from God's word, there's different truths

791
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,560
 that really are the things that you need

792
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,700
 to rehearse in your mind and replay

793
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,520
 over and over and over and over again.

794
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,440
 'Cause we live in a world

795
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,920
 that as soon as you walk outside of these doors,

796
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,680
 they're gonna say, this is what beauty looks like,

797
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,960
 this is where worth is found,

798
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,280
 this is what you should look like for,

799
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,720
 or look for in a spouse,

800
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,760
 and look like it if you're gonna get a spouse.

801
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,900
 And you need to speak the truth.

802
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,640
 There is power when you speak the truth.

803
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,200
 Whether it is you rehearsing

804
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,240
 in the face of sin, temptation, or shame,

805
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,980
 I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

806
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,440
 That's who I am.

807
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,340
 Whether it is you saying,

808
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,080
 hey, I am fearfully and wonderfully made,

809
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,600
 I'm not gonna find my value in the number on a scale,

810
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,640
 I'm not gonna find my value

811
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,700
 in what some guy thinks of me,

812
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,860
 I'm not gonna find my value

813
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,160
 with the world and the Oscars

814
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,480
 and what everyone needs to look like,

815
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,560
 that's not where I find it

816
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,000
 because all that's there is emptiness.

817
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,400
 One of the things that even in the porch

818
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
 that we week after week see,

819
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,520
 for whatever reason God is entrusted in,

820
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,940
 hold on, just a platform where different people

821
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,560
 at different stages and different successful spheres

822
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,920
 are connected to this ministry

823
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,960
 or have been encouraged by it

824
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,080
 and will reach out in different things

825
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,120
 and over and over and over again,

826
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,300
 despite the fact that they have

827
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,480
 everything you would ever want in life,

828
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,720
 despite the fact they look like everything

829
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,160
 everyone would ever want to look like,

830
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,280
 they're saying, I'm empty, I'm empty,

831
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,520
 and I feel like I'm finding hope

832
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,400
 because I'm finding Jesus.

833
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,060
 And you need to speak the truth to yourself.

834
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,040
 When you wake up tomorrow

835
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,280
 and you are tempted to binge and purge again,

836
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,880
 you are tempted to hate what you see in the mirror.

837
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,000
 I am fearfully and wonderfully made,

838
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,020
 my God makes no mistakes.

839
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,560
 Whatever was said about me in the fourth grade

840
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,400
 that I've carried around,

841
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,560
 I'm big bone and big shoulders,

842
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,840
 I refuse to let that define me anymore.

843
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,160
 My God has made me,

844
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,840
 he makes no mistakes.

845
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,140
 And I'm gonna embrace who I am,

846
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,980
 I'm gonna know who I am,

847
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
 I'm gonna like who I am,

848
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,000
 I'm gonna be who I am.

849
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,120
 'Cause if God is gonna use you,

850
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,160
 he's gonna use you as you trying to be you.

851
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,040
 Not you trying to be me,

852
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,320
 not you trying to look like her,

853
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,360
 not you trying to look like him

854
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,000
 or trying to be anybody else.

855
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,840
 And you need to speak the truth to yourself.

856
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,520
 There is power when we speak the truth.

857
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
 This is who I am.

858
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,880
 And then finally, there's some of you

859
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,400
 who you're walking alone.

860
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,540
 And I don't know what goals

861
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,940
 or what you're trying to accomplish,

862
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,040
 but I know this, it is not likely to happen

863
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,520
 if you don't have others in your life.

864
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,440
 Whether it is, I mean,

865
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,760
 you could just see the worldly example.

866
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,440
 The reason CrossFit has this like crazy

867
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,560
 cult following with it

868
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,960
 is 'cause they all kind of come together

869
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,880
 and it's like, hey, I'm in.

870
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,840
 Where were you, Barry?

871
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,720
 And it's just, we're all circling together.

872
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,080
 That is how you were designed to live.

873
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,320
 And that's what the Christian life is all about.

874
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
 That God didn't say it's for CrossFit.

875
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,600
 The reason CrossFit's so popular

876
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,220
 is because God, from the beginning of creation,

877
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,320
 said it's not good to be alone

878
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,600
 and you're meant to have others in your life

879
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,200
 and you don't have those people.

880
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,100
 And you're not gonna experience

881
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,260
 the abundant health that God wants.

882
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,500
 You're not gonna experience a soul care that God wants

883
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,420
 if you don't have other people.

884
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,140
 So tonight, there's a chance for you

885
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,940
 to take the next step and get plugged into community.

886
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,780
 You can go right down this hall if you're a guy.

887
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,640
 You can get in a circle with other guys

888
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,740
 that are just like you,

889
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,420
 that don't have people walking alongside of them.

890
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
 And you'll take that step towards health

891
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,780
 in lots of directions,

892
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,820
 primarily on the inside,

893
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,160
 but also it often leads,

894
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,660
 discipline has this weird thing where it's contagious.

895
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,100
 When a discipline shows up in your life,

896
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,340
 it's like it invites its friends.

897
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,380
 And you become more disciplined and more disciplined.

898
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,960
 And you can step towards that tonight

899
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,840
 with other people in your life.

900
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,100
 If you're a girl, you can go right down this hall

901
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,860
 and get connected with other girls

902
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,800
 to walk alongside of you.

903
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
 And finally,

904
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,960
 I know there's some that are here

905
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,300
 that are walking through,

906
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,940
 man, you have just bought the lies

907
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,860
 and you don't even know where the truth, where to turn.

908
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,320
 As a dad of a daughter,

909
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,120
 I have become so much more aware

910
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,520
 and so much more cognizant.

911
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,000
 And I'll speak just to the ladies

912
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 of how many lies day after day after day are fed.

913
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,240
 Dude, this is what you should look like ladies.

914
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,120
 And it's a lie.

915
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,520
 And I also am highly aware the same lies are fed

916
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,040
 to the men about where your worth is found

917
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,840
 and what kind of woman you should look for.

918
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,120
 And you may not have anyone to turn to.

919
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,380
 You may be like, man, I feel like I'm,

920
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,040
 I just can't get out of this rut.

921
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,420
 We would love to pray with you,

922
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,020
 come alongside of you,

923
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,220
 connect with you at whatever degree you're interested.

924
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,580
 And we have an entire team that'll be down front

925
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,220
 that would love to serve you in any way that you can.

926
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,540
 Whether it's about tonight's message,

927
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,300
 maybe you just have an uncle who's sick

928
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,500
 and you just want someone to pray for you.

929
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,780
 We'd love to pray for you, answer questions,

930
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,300
 recommend a good restaurant next,

931
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,580
 anything that we can do to serve you,

932
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,740
 we would love to do.

933
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,820
 But for the rest of you guys,

934
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
 that's all that we have tonight.

935
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,660
 We love y'all.

936
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,100
 Go in peace to love and serve the Lord this week.

937
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,100
