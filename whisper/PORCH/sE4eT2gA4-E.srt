00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,500
 [APPLAUSE]

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
 >> Porto, how we doing?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,500
 >> [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
 >> Man, it's so good to be with you.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,000
 When I was in high school, I got invited to this youth group.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
 And it was like my mom's friend was like, I was Catholic,

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
 I was going to Catholic school, I was an altar boy, the whole deal.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
 And there was a church in town and they had the youth group.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
 It was the Baptist Church, they had the youth group.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And my mom's friend was like, hey, Jonathan should come,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,500
 we're doing this kind of theme on sexuality and whatnot.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:10,000
 And I had heard that if you went through it, you got a ring and it was a gold ring.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,500
 And so my questions were like, is the ring real gold?

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
 What kind of ring am I going to get?

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
 And it was called True Love Waits.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
 And this isn't where I hate on purity culture, because honestly,

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 they said some helpful things.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,000
 I just didn't listen.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And I went through it, I made it through, I got the ring.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And I was pretty committed, I'm saving myself for marriage, for sure, right?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,500
 And, you know, as the high school years progressed, my friends,

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,000
 my best friends in this relationship, and they break up,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,500
 and I had heard that his girlfriend had a crush on me, and I'm pretty lonely.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 And so we start talking, and one thing leads to the next, and we had sex.

27
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,500
 And I didn't want to, and I was like embarrassed that I didn't want to.

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,000
 And, you know, this isn't like me blaming her at all.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,500
 Like, I'm totally culpable for my own decisions.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I remember getting home and just being really, like, sad about it,

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 and I walked up to my dresser, and that ring was sitting on the dresser,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and I picked it up, and I put it in the drawer, and I just thought,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,500
 "Game on. Game on."

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 You know, it's like, "Nothing to save for now."

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 And it just became sport. Like, "Let's go."

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,000
 And I went into my senior year, and I kind of tried to, like,

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,500
 "All right, I'm going to get right. I'm going to get right with God.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm going to college. I need to be grown up."

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,500
 And so what I do is I create these rules for myself.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,000
 I'm going to go to college, no sex, no getting drunk, no doing drugs.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And I get to college. My parents drop me off in the on-campus apartment,

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 and they leave, and I remember this sense of freedom just overwhelming me.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And in the first two weeks, I broke every single rule that I had created for myself

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 in epic proportion.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,500
 And I didn't know what to do, but I was a good Catholic boy.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,000
 Every night, I would say my prayers, and there I'm in my twin-size bed

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,500
 in my apartment on campus, and I'm praying to God,

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 and I just start weeping, like violently, by myself, just violently weeping,

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,000
 thinking, like, "He doesn't hear me. Like, my prayers are bouncing off the ceiling.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
 Nobody's listening."

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 And I didn't know what to do, so I reached out to someone who was a little older

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 and supposedly wiser than me, and I just, like, confessed all my junk to them.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,000
 I'm like, "Here's what's going on. I've been here for two weeks,

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,500
 and I've done this, and I've done this, and I've done this,

55
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
 and I went here, and I did this."

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And I just start pouring out my heart to them, and they said,

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 "That's just kind of college. That's just what you do."

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
 And I was like, "Yeah, but what about faith?"

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 They're like, "You know, when you come out, you kind of get right with God."

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
 It was the worst advice in the world.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,500
 When I got out of college, I really just continued in that theme.

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 I moved to Dallas, lived in Uptown, the penthouse condo, had the car, the job.

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,000
 Just like, "Want to be a millionaire before I'm 30? Let's go. Let's go."

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And at this moment in my life, I still kind of like,

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 "Hey, there's a God, big guy in the sky. I talk to Him when I need something.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Please don't let her be pregnant," kind of thing, right?

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,500
 And so here I'm at in this place, and I want to know some things.

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,000
 There's three big questions that I have.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm searching God's will, and I'm like, "Where do you want me to live?

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Do you want me to stay here? Is it Dallas? Is this where I need to be?

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Why don't I move to one of the coasts? Why don't I move closer to the ocean?

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Why don't I move to the mountains? Are you sure it's Dallas? Where do you want me to be?"

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And then it was, "What do you want me to do? How do you want me to earn money?

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 God, what is it that I'm supposed to do? Am I doing the right thing?

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Should I take another job, move jobs? Should I make more money?"

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And then it was, "Who do you want me to marry?

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 God, who am I going to spend the rest of my life with?" Those were my three big questions.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 "God, what is your will for me?"

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And if I was God, and I was talking to me in that moment,

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 this is my response to me in that moment.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 "Why should I tell you?

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 You haven't listened to anything I've asked of you.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Like, you want to know my will?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I've got like 66 books of my will.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I've explicitly communicated it to you in here,

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and you've continued to do what you wanted to do,

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 so why am I going to make known my mysterious will if you've forsaken my revealed will?

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Why am I going to show up to you and say, 'Oh, man, let me write it on the wall.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Let me send you an email. Let me send you a letter.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Let me tell you in an audible voice or a burning bush,

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 'This is my will for you, JP,'

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 when everything I've asked you to do, you haven't listened?

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 You've just done what you wanted to do?"

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And so I want to talk with you for the few minutes that we have,

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 God's will for you and sex.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 God's will for you and sex.

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And it is going to be like completely clear.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I'm going to reach you a verse that says,

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 "This is God's will for you."

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 It's going to be that kind of clear.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And I think that if we hear that tonight, like in some ways,

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 we're culpable just because of the geographic space that we take up tonight,

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 where we're at and the words that you're hearing,

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 you're going to leave here with tremendous clarity,

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 "This is God's will."

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And I think you have to ask the question,

107
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 "Why would he make known to me his mysterious will

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 if I have forsaken his revealed will?"

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's going to be clear from the scriptures.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And in fact, there's a warning in this passage,

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 and I'm just going to read to you the last verse I'm going to teach tonight.

112
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It says in verse 8,

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 "Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being,

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit."

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 That's the punctuation of the text that we're in this evening.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And I'm going to be in 1 Thessalonians.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 If you want to turn there, 1 Thessalonians.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It's in the New Testament.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 You have the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Keep going.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Keep turning.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Keep going.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You're going to get there.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 1 Thessalonians.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The sexual landscape of Thessalonica is crazy.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Like, you think, "Man, Dallas, JP, you don't understand what's happening.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Like, tender and like the hookup culture and like, you know, we go out and it's crazy, man.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And there's so much sexual confusion."

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Thessalonica 2,000 years ago was even worse.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 It had a Roman culture.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And so pedophilia is completely normative there.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Like, you could just have an underage lover and it was totally fine.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 There was really no sexual boundaries in this culture whatsoever.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Homosexuality is rampant here.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Lots of gender confusion in this culture.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 That's not a new thing, by the way.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Really big in Thessalonica where he wrote this letter to.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And so as we read it, we can think, "Okay, this is applicable to us today.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Like, there's something about this."

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And in fact, as the church is born, the sexual culture and landscape is changing.

142
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But the church is undergoing extreme persecution so much so that the leaders of the church have to flee for their lives.

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 That's what's happening around this letter that I'm going to read to you.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It is a letter, by the way, preserved by the Holy Spirit for thousands of years so that we can apply it to the porch tonight.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 The sexual landscape here in Dallas or if you're at another porch live location, I'm sure in your culture, in the United States of America, if that's where you're at, or if you're overseas, right, there's --

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I'll just read to you some stats, right?

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 91.5% of men and 60.2% of women report consuming porn in the past month.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 This place is not an exception, and you know that.

149
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Because you're just thinking, "No, it was like seven, eight, oh, yeah, it was within the past month."

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Your generation is actually having less sex because they've grown addicted to the counterfeit version of it.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 The shortcut, "Hey, I have it on my phone. I can just go here and watch this video. It's just me in the shower," right?

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And you've actually grown an appetite for a counterfeit version of sex so much so that marriage rates are down, sexual satisfaction rates are down, and your generation is having less sex, but it's not good news.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It's not like, "Oh, we're having less sex because we're going to church." It's we're addicted to the fake stuff.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 We've grown our appetite for the fake stuff.

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And what I want you to know right now, and I just don't want to delay this message anymore.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I'm going to hit on it later, but I want to make sure you understand this.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 In case you leave, you've got to go to the bathroom, or you get a phone call or something, you can be forgiven.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 You can be clean.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You can find freedom.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It's available to you.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And tonight can be a turning point.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And if you came with your sexually active boyfriend or girlfriend, I'm sorry that I'm not sorry.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And it's going to be uncomfortable.

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And I'm so glad you're here.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And it's not by accident.

166
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Like, God knew what he was doing.

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Let's go.

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 First Thessalonians chapter 4.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Chapter 4.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 We'll start in verse 2.

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 That's a big deal.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Hey, hey, you know what we said.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 By the authority of Jesus, it is God's will.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It is God's will that you should be sanctified, that you should avoid sexual immorality.

176
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 There it is right there.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 This is God's will for you.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 That you should be sanctified.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 That you should avoid sexual immorality.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 So first point this evening, God's will, is that we would become holy and stay pure.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 That we would become holy and stay pure.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 We say it on the podcast that I get to be a part of every week.

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That you're becoming something.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 That every future, your training in every moment is training for a future moment.

185
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Like right now, you are training for a future version of yourself.

186
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And no one here is like, man, when I get married, I can't wait to commit adultery.

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And yet it happens all the time.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Right?

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 When I get married, I can't wait to be a drunk, addicted to gambling.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Like I'm going to be enslaved to pornography.

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And yet that you're going to become a bigger future version of yourself right now.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 That's kind of how life works.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 You're training for that moment right now.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And he says, be holy.

195
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 He doesn't just say, avoid sexual immorality.

196
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 He says, pursue this.

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 He says, set your aim on this.

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 What? Becoming holy.

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 You don't need to be a normal Dallas young adult.

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 A normal young adult in Houston.

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Or in any other part of this country that God has called you holy.

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 That's sanctified.

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That's a part.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 That you would be different.

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Right now, you could commit in your heart, no, I'm going to be different.

206
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I'm going to be different.

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He says, be different how?

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 In the way that I remain pure.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Become holy.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And stay pure.

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And if you're like, ever, like, well, but dude, everybody's doing it.

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 That right there should tell you that then you're not set apart.

213
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 If you take part.

214
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Because you're called to be different.

215
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 First Corinthians 6, 18-20 says, flee sexual immorality.

216
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body.

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 But whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.

218
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you?

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Whom you've received from God?

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 You are not your own.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You've been bought by a price.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Therefore, honor God with your body.

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 With your body.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Honor God with your body.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Okay?

226
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 You're different.

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So when it comes to sexual immorality, you're not like, oh, let me see how close I can get, how far is too far.

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 He says, you turn around 180 degrees and you run as fast as you can.

229
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 That's not, well, just one look, just one click.

230
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Let me just watch the first 30 seconds.

231
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 No, you stop and you turn and you run.

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And if you're like, oh, man, but what is sexual immorality?

233
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Okay, no one in Thessalonica is asking that.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 The word, the Greek word is pornia and it's very clear.

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 It involves all, or includes all kinds of sex.

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 It includes regular sex, anal sex, sexting, oral sex.

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It includes make out sessions.

238
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Like all of that's included in this word.

239
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 When your body begins to prepare itself for sex and you are thinking lustfully, cross that line.

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Cross that line.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Like that's this word.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 That's what he's talking about here.

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And I know some of you are fighting for purity and you find a victory and I'm so proud of you.

244
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And some of you, you cross major lines and I want you to know it's not too late.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 I did too.

246
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And I have the privilege of reading God's word.

247
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 The edge you hear in my voice, it's not anger at you.

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It's frustrations with the enemy that seeks to drag us all to hell.

249
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 He wants to rob us of life.

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Jesus came so we might have life and have it to the fullest.

251
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And he's come to steal, kill, and destroy.

252
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 What I want you to understand at a deep heart level is like sex, that was God's idea.

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I know it's like, that's not like a mind blown moment, but like he invented it.

254
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Like he made the parts the way they did.

255
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 On the guy he gave that part and on the girl he makes it fit.

256
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And if you watch at this diagram, no I'm just kidding, no diagram.

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 No diagram.

258
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 No drawings.

259
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 No images.

260
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But come back with me.

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Let me just say this.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Like he put the nerve endings where he did and made it feel the way it does.

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 That was all God's idea.

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 He's like, hey, father, son, holy spirit.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I got an idea.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 What?

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Are you serious?

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Yeah.

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Why?

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Babies.

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Oh, cool.

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It didn't happen that way.

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Anyways, it was their idea.

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 That's my point.

275
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Steve Jobs is to the iPhone, God is to sex.

276
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 The inventor, the creator, the genius behind it.

277
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 There's this commercial, it was originally in Sweden, where this woman gave her father an iPad for Christmas.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And he's in the kitchen and they're talking, you know, and he's cutting up vegetables.

279
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 You just see him making something in the kitchen, he's cutting up vegetables and she's talking to him.

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And she's like, dad, how did you like the iPad?

281
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And he's like, the what?

282
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 And she goes, you know, the iPad I gave you for Christmas.

283
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And he's like, oh, I like it quite nicely.

284
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And it zooms out and you see he's cutting the vegetables on the iPad and he takes it and then he runs it under the sink and then he puts it in the dishwasher.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And as you watch the video, the cry of your heart is like, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what that's for.

286
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And that must be how God and the angels and the saints who've gone before you watch us.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Right. And we're like we're we're trying to create ways to pursue pleasure for ourselves.

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Like, no, that's not what that's for. No, we invented that for for procreation and to to bond a husband to his wife.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And what we try to do is we like, no, no, no, we want the pleasure.

290
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 The pleasure serves a purpose. If it didn't feel good, we wouldn't have babies.

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 You know, if it felt like a spinal tab, like if it hurt, like like humanity would cease to exist.

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But God's like, no, I'm going to incentivize them to procreate.

293
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So they fill the world with my people. And it bonds, you know, for this reason, a man will use father and mother be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh.

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And you fast forward the tape a couple thousand years, a few thousand years.

295
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And now science or brilliant scientists say, you know what, this is crazy.

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 We've discovered something called sex glue that whenever you experience orgasm or sexual release, your brain creates a synapse, which is like a muscle that bonds you to your surroundings.

297
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 This is just as fascinating, and we'd like turn back to Genesis 2 and we're like, yeah, that's what God said.

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 That's what God said that that that they would be one.

299
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 And so we want to do is we want to separate the pleasure and prevent the procreation and prevent the bonding so that we can keep the pleasure to ourselves.

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And it's like when you take all the nutrition out of something that you eat and you're left with something that just rots you and makes you unhealthy.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 That's what we do with sex. And that's what you're seeing in your culture.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And a God who loves you say, I want you to avoid it because I don't want you depressed or anxious.

303
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I want you to experience true, sustaining joy.

304
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And so I take in a place I made a place for it.

305
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It's like there's a house when we lived in Dallas, there was a house that here that burned down and it killed everyone inside.

306
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And and as you understood the story, it was wintertime and they had a fire going in the fireplace.

307
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Well, the log rolled out of the fireplace onto the carpet.

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And while everybody slept, the house went up a blaze and killed everyone inside of it.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 This is a fire in the fireplace. The fire produces warmth and it's beauty.

310
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It's beauty. It's people gather around it. It's awesome.

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Out of the fireplace. It's destructive. This is like a picture of sex.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Like God's like, hey, I created a spot for it. And it's not in a dating relationship and it's not in the shower by yourself.

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 It's in marriage. Like that's where and you pull it.

314
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 If you take it out of that context, you will experience destruction.

315
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Without exception. Verse four.

316
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 That each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lusts like the pagans who do not know God.

317
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 He says the way that we battle sexual immorality as we're being sanctified as we practice self-control.

318
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 What I want you to know what he's saying is self-control is possible that God's way.

319
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 My second point is self-control is possible that it is possible.

320
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Self-control is a fruit of the spirit. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control.

321
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It's something that this Holy Spirit produces in us when we surrender to him.

322
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 What this means and this will be helpful to you is that you should not go through life and do everything you want to do.

323
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 That you're going to have desires that are harmful to you.

324
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 In Philippians it says their God is their stomach. Their destiny is destruction.

325
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Their enemy is the cross. Their enemies are the cross of Christ.

326
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Meaning they have appetites that they feed to their own demise.

327
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 That you have desires that you shouldn't act out on.

328
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 This is an essence of maturity.

329
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Immature children do whatever they feel like.

330
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I'm a dad of three and when they were little I'm so confident.

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 They walked into a room and said, "What's the dumbest thing I can do right now?"

332
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I'm going to color on the wall.

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 It's like, "Why not? Here's a knife and here's the couch. Why not?"

334
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 It's like, "What?"

335
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I remember when Weston was four years old.

336
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 He had a cup of milk and he was holding it like this.

337
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I wonder what would happen when I turn it upside down on the table.

338
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 It's just like milk everywhere.

339
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I said, "What are you doing? Buddy, why did you do that?"

340
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 "I don't know. Because I felt like it."

341
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 That's what children do.

342
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 As we grow in maturity.

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It's cute when you're four. It's not cute when you're 24.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Or 34.

345
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 At some point you have to say, "This is what I want to do but it's not what I'm going to do."

346
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Because it's not holy and honorable.

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Instead of doing that, I'm going to practice self-control.

348
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 What he's saying is that you'll never have to sin.

349
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Even when you wake up at 2am and can't sleep, it's not like, "Oh, now you have to sin."

350
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 No, you don't have to sin.

351
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 1 Corinthians 10:13 says, "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man, and God is faithful."

352
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 "He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear."

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 "If you are tempted, he will provide a way out so that you can stand up under it."

354
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Meaning, never in your life will the options be A) sin or B) sin.

355
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 There's always going to be a C) a way out.

356
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 That you can stand up under.

357
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It may be difficult, but we can do hard things, right?

358
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Like, we can endure.

359
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Paul's in prison. Whip. Jesus on the cross.

360
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 We can like, "Yeah, you know what? I just may not sleep very well tonight."

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 We can endure hard things.

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 "I'm really lonely tonight."

363
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 It's okay to be lonely one night.

364
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Let me call some friends, ask them to pray for me.

365
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 No, I'm not going to call the ex-boyfriend.

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 No, no. I can... It's okay.

367
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 I can endure a moment of loneliness, even a season of loneliness.

368
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I can do hard things.

369
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 He says, "Dear friends," in 1 Peter 2,

370
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul."

371
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 You have sinful desires that you are to abstain from.

372
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 This is the point.

373
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I do this deal every Friday. I'm taking a break right now.

374
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 But Friday Q&A.

375
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And all the time, there's masturbation, a sin.

376
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 What does this look like?

377
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I travel and speak on sexual sin.

378
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 People at this stage, right here.

379
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Like, I have had this conversation hundreds and hundreds of times.

380
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Let me tell you what it looks like.

381
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I say, "Man, my struggles... My story is like yours, man."

382
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 "What's your story? What is it?"

383
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 "Oh, no, man. We just have similar struggles. Similar backgrounds."

384
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "Yeah, like what? What is it?"

385
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 "You know, just similar struggles."

386
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 "Oh, pornography? You're looking at porn? You're struggling with porn?"

387
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "Yeah, man. I'm struggling with porn. Struggling. I am struggling with porn, man."

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 "Oh, hey, man. I got you."

389
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 "Hey, how do you access pornography?"

390
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 "What do you mean?"

391
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 "How do you access porn?"

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 "Oh, you know, my phone."

393
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 "Where's your phone?"

394
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 "It's in my pocket."

395
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 "Oh, cool. I thought you said you were struggling."

396
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 "You're just carrying around with you everywhere you go."

397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 "You're not struggling?"

398
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "You haven't even started to fight."

399
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 "You haven't even gotten in the ring."

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 "You haven't even put the gloves on or anything."

401
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 "You're talking about struggling."

402
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 "No, no, no. You're just like, 'Come with me everywhere I go.'"

403
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "Come on, porn. Let's go."

404
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 "What do you want me to do, man?"

405
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 "Pastor, you want me to get rid of my phone?"

406
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 "Sure."

407
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 "Yeah. Get rid of your phone."

408
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 "I mean, get a brick phone. I don't know. Get a Motorola Razr."

409
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 "Get some other kind of phone. It's all grainy."

410
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "You're not going to look at porn on that."

411
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 "Get some other kind of phone."

412
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "Why have a phone that tempts you every single time you're by yourself?"

413
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 "You're like, 'Oh, it's a gateway to all kinds of explicit images.'"

414
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 "But, man, I'm really struggling."

415
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 "No, no, no. You are like lunch to some demon."

416
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 "You're like, 'Come and get me, demons.'"

417
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 "Like, 'Here I am. I like porn, and I got it with me in my pocket.'"

418
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 "That's what's happening."

419
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 "You're not struggling. Let's be honest."

420
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 "I can deal with anybody if you're honest."

421
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 "You come up, you're like, 'Man, let me be honest with you.'"

422
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 "Great. We can talk about a path to healing."

423
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 "But if you're like, 'I want to play games so that I can struggle.'"

424
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 "I'm like, 'How long have you been struggling?'"

425
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 "Since the fifth grade."

426
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 "Do you know how old you are?"

427
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 "I mean, porn and masturbation since the fifth grade?"

428
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "You're going to take that into marriage and be like, 'Oh, but now I'm going to be faithful.'"

429
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 "No, no, you're not."

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 "That's not how that works."

431
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 "That's not how that works."

432
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 "Guess who's that worked for?"

433
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 "No one in the history of the world."

434
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 "Because an addiction to porn is not an addiction to sex."

435
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 "It's an addiction to variety."

436
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "And it's not like all of a sudden you get in this monogamous relationship."

437
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "It's like, 'No, I know that I went to university for adultery.'"

438
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 "But now I'm going to be faithful."

439
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 "And I'm going to be totally satisfied with your body."

440
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 "Even when it changes, and even as you grow old."

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 "And even as gravity takes its toll on you."

442
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 "You're still going to be the one for me."

443
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 "Even though I have fed my mind with thousands of images that are very different than that."

444
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 "Right? That's not..."

445
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 "Listen, I'm just talking logic, guys."

446
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 "I'm just appealing to your logic right now."

447
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 "That's not how it works for anyone."

448
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 "And we don't think it's that big of a deal."

449
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 "Yes, I understand with the invention of AI, the game just changed."

450
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 "VR, the game just changed."

451
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 "You better suit up for battle."

452
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 "And ladies, you're not off the hook."

453
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 "I mean, we do a ministry for people addicted to pornography right now."

454
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 "And half of them are female."

455
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 "And you guys aren't talking about it."

456
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 "And you've got to start talking about it."

457
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 "Okay? You've got to help your sisters out."

458
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 "Especially if you found freedom, you've got to tell your story."

459
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "They need you."

460
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "They need you to tell your story."

461
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Jesus said in Matthew 5, "If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out."

462
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off."

463
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 He's like, "Hey, take extreme steps to get well from this."

464
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 "Don't compromise."

465
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 As we talk about sex, if you're like, "Well, I feel like I left behind."

466
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 "Everybody's getting ahead, and that's a way to find a husband."

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 "No, it's a way to find a really bad marriage that you would be much better off single."

468
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Verse 6, "And in this matter, no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister."

469
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 I need you to feel the weight on this one, man.

470
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Just read the Bible.

471
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 "The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins."

472
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 "As we told you and warned you before."

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life."

474
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being."

475
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "But God, the very God who gives you His Holy Spirit."

476
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 God's warning.

477
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 This whole idea of safe sex, it's a lie.

478
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Someone always dies.

479
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Sex outside of marriage is never safe.

480
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Sex outside His design is never safe.

481
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 That's my third point.

482
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Sex outside His design is never safe.

483
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 It says in the Greek, literally, "God is the avenger of such things."

484
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Some of you, you're here and you know sex is a big deal.

485
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Because at some point in your past, you've experienced some sort of abuse.

486
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I want you to know, I hate that.

487
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I won't even be able to do it justice in a one to many communication.

488
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 But we're here for you.

489
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 This church, like no other church I know of on earth.

490
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 The leadership here, they are helping people find freedom.

491
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 There's an amazing ministry here.

492
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 There are several ministries here.

493
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 If you don't have a church that you call home, I beg you to check this place out.

494
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Kylin, I honor.

495
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 I'm so grateful for his leadership over this ministry.

496
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 TA and the elders of Watermark Community Church.

497
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I've been so encouraged by everything that I've seen God do here.

498
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 If you're like, "I don't know what to do," just show up and say, "I need help."

499
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 We'll take it from there.

500
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 We got you.

501
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 We got you.

502
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 You know what a big deal this is.

503
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 There's a part of it you can find.

504
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 It's not like somebody's going to get away with it.

505
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But what I want you to know, the craziest thing, and it's not even fair.

506
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 If you're here and you're like, "Man, I've done some things.

507
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I feel dirty.

508
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I feel unclean.

509
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 I feel re-traumatized.

510
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I'm thinking about prom night and I'm thinking about everything thereafter.

511
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I'm thinking about -- I, too, just thought, 'Hey, game on.'"

512
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 There's a reset for you.

513
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 We just celebrated Easter.

514
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Jesus took all of that on him.

515
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 He satisfied God's anger towards you.

516
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 He took it all on him so that God looks at you and he's just free to love you.

517
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 If you need a verse, 2 Corinthians 5:19, it says, "He's no longer counting your sins against you."

518
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Romans 8, 1, "For there is now no condemnation," that's consequence or punishment,

519
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 "for those of you who are in Christ Jesus."

520
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 That's crazy.

521
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 "For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.

522
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 It's not of yourself.

523
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 It's the gift of God.

524
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Not by works so that no one can boast."

525
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Like God can make you clean.

526
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 There's this scene in "Redeeming Love" where she's trying to scrub off the sin

527
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 and she's scrubbing her arms so hard that it begins to bleed.

528
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And maybe you've felt that way.

529
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And I'm telling you it is only Jesus.

530
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 And I'm telling you from experience and by trusting in the word,

531
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 it's only Jesus who can make you clean like that.

532
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Only Christ.

533
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It says God is the avenger of such things.

534
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 When my daughter was 4 years old, we were at this camp.

535
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 And she has like a really big personality and she's just cute and sweet.

536
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 She's got her little pigtails.

537
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And she goes up to this boy about her age and she's like, "Hi, I'm Presley."

538
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And he looks at her and he takes a step back and he just throws her to the ground.

539
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 And I'm like back here like watching.

540
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And she hits the ground and she does that like silent cry where she's like screaming

541
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 but nothing's coming out.

542
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 She's like, "What just happened to me?"

543
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And I'm thinking, "Oh, no.

544
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 There's going to be a homicide right here.

545
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 This is about to be a crime scene."

546
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And I look at this little boy.

547
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I'm like, "Where is your mama?"

548
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Because I'm about to see how far I can kick you.

549
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Like what in the world just happened?

550
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 What were you thinking?

551
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And I was telling my friend that.

552
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And he was like, "Yeah, that must be how God felt about you."

553
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I'm like, "Wait, what?"

554
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, man.

555
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Like I read 1 Thessalonians 4.

556
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 You were out there with his daughter.

557
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 He's like, 'That must be how he felt about you.'"

558
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 What a harsh warning.

559
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But Christ, so that I can be up here and repent of those actions and ask for forgiveness

560
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 to those I've hurt and to say, "Hey, let me tell you my story just in case it's your story

561
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 so that you can find the same freedom that was available to me."

562
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Somebody, I was here, I was at this place 20 years ago.

563
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And somebody asked me two questions.

564
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 They said, "Between 1 and 10, 10 being certain, 1 being not so sure, if you died today,

565
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 how certain are you that you'd go to heaven?"

566
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Okay, let me give it to you again.

567
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 They said, "Between 1 and 10, 10 being certain, 1 being not so sure, if you died today,

568
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 how certain are you that you would go to heaven?"

569
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Okay, just think of a number, okay?

570
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Y'all may ask this every week.

571
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I have no idea.

572
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But I want you to think of your number.

573
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Between 10, I'm 100% positive.

574
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 1, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.

575
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 5, it's kind of a coin toss right now.

576
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 I've got some things going on.

577
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Where are you at?

578
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 What's your number between 1 and 10?

579
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 You get your number.

580
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Think of a number between 1 and 10.

581
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 10 being certain I'm going to heaven.

582
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 1 being I'm pretty sure I'm not.

583
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Where are you at in that scale?

584
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 If you're cool with it, let me just ask you, would you -- everybody have a number?

585
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Give me a head nod if you've got a number.

586
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 You've got a number?

587
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Everybody got a number?

588
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Okay, well, just do this if you would.

589
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Like everybody close your eyes for a second.

590
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 All right?

591
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Close your eyes or I'll call you up here.

592
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Say, "Come help me."

593
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 All right, you got your eyes closed?

594
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Everybody got their eyes closed?

595
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 I'm looking.

596
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Okay, everybody's got their eyes closed.

597
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 All right.

598
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 On that, as you think through that question, if your number -- if your number is 1, 2,

599
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 or 3, would you just raise your hand?

600
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Okay, some hands.

601
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Yeah, lots of hands.

602
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 1, 2, 3.

603
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Okay, I see you.

604
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 All right, put it down.

605
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 If you're 4, 5, or 6, would you raise your hand?

606
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Okay, a lot of 4, 5's or 6's.

607
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 I see you.

608
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Okay, you can put it down.

609
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 If you're 7, 8, or 9, would you raise your hand?

610
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Okay.

611
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Okay.

612
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Yeah, you can put it down.

613
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 All right, you can open your eyes.

614
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Because 10 seems arrogant.

615
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Anything else would be arrogant.

616
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Anything else, like a 9 would be like, "There's a part of it that's up to me."

617
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 An 8, "There's a part of it that's up to me."

618
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 A 7, "Well, I don't -- you know, I've done some -- oh, it's up to you?

619
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Oh, you getting to heaven has something to do with what you do?

620
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Because I thought it was -- I thought it was Good Friday and Easter.

621
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 I thought it was, "Oh, he died for your sins."

622
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 But, yeah, but, God, you had to allow your son to die, and I've got to be good.

623
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Right? That's the gospel.

624
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Trust in Jesus, his death and forgiveness for your sins, his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins,

625
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 and be a good person.

626
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 That's the gospel.

627
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 That's the gospel, everybody.

628
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 That's the good news.

629
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Why did Jesus die?

630
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Why did Jesus die?

631
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Because you're a pervert.

632
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Why did Jesus die?

633
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Prom night.

634
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Why did Jesus die?

635
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 Sixth date on Tinder.

636
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Yeah, we went too far.

637
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Why did he die?

638
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 It seems like, JP, it seems like if I could know, the Bible would tell me I could know.

639
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 That's 1 John 5, 13.

640
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you can know that you have eternal life.

641
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 You can be certain.

642
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 You can be 100% sure, and it has nothing to do with what you do and everything to do with what he did for you on the cross,

643
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 that all of your sins went on him.

644
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 The wrath of God, his anger at your sins were satisfied on Jesus.

645
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 They go in the grave, and he comes out without them.

646
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 That's the good news.

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Like, that's the good news.

648
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 The good news is that you don't have to pay for your sins.

649
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 So how do I get to heaven?

650
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 You believe fully that Jesus Christ died for your sins and that God raised him from the dead.

651
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 And when you believe upon that, everything begins to change.

652
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Well, I'm going to believe, but I want to get clean first.

653
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 No, no, no.

654
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 You can't get clean.

655
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 He has to clean you.

656
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 That's the way this works.

657
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 In summary, God's will is sanctification through sexual purity.

658
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 God's way is avoiding sexual immorality through self-control.

659
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 And God's warning is the serious consequences of sexual sin.

660
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 What happened to me, I moved to Dallas.

661
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 I was at a club, Lower Greenville.

662
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 20 years ago, somebody said, "Hey, come check out this church with me."

663
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 I came to this place, hung over, smelled like smoke from the night before, sat in the back row, started wrestling with, "What do I really believe about God?

664
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 What do I really believe about God?"

665
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And I heard the gospel.

666
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 And I had heard the gospel before, but something changed because somebody asked me these two questions.

667
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 I said a seven.

668
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 They said, "Why would you -- if God said, 'Why should I let you in?' What would you say?"

669
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 And I said, "Well, because I've been a good person and I've tried hard."

670
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And they said, "Huh, that's interesting.

671
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I thought you get to heaven by trusting that Jesus Christ died for your sins and God raised him from the dead."

672
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 See, there's only one thing you can do in hell, and that's pay for your sins forever.

673
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And the only person who doesn't go to hell is the person who's been forgiven.

674
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Every sin has been paid for, either in hell or on the cross.

675
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And they said, "JP, do you want to believe that your sins have been paid for on the cross forever and ever and ever?"

676
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 And I said, "Yeah, man.

677
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I'm in on that.

678
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 I need to be clean like that."

679
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 And I trusted in Christ.

680
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 It went from here to here, and everything changed.

681
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 And I was dating this girl, and we were sexually active.

682
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 And I said, "Hey, I don't think we should have sex anymore."

683
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 And she was like, "Man, I agree.

684
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 I've been telling you that."

685
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 And I was like, "All right."

686
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 So we tried that for like two months.

687
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 And I was like, "Man, this is really hard.

688
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 We should get married."

689
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 So we did.

690
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And we went to this chapel, and dressed in a tux.

691
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 She's in a white dress.

692
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And said some crazy things.

693
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 "For richer, poorer, and sickness than hell, till death do us part."

694
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 And we, "You may kiss your bride."

695
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And we went to the foyer, and I held her in my arms, my new bride.

696
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 And I said this prayer.

697
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 I said, "Lord, thank you so much for allowing me to escape the consequences of my sin."

698
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 And the consequences of my sin, I thought were like, because I don't have an STD.

699
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 And I haven't, you know, we haven't had a child out of wedlock.

700
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 You know, there's no abortion.

701
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 And I know that some of you, you're sitting in those consequences.

702
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 But what I want you to know is I said that prayer, "Thank you for allowing me to escape my consequences."

703
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 I got a year into marriage, and I realized I hadn't escaped the consequences.

704
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 They just came in different form.

705
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 And I had no idea how to love this woman.

706
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 I had trained myself for variety, and I didn't know how to be stuck in a marriage.

707
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 Or committed in a marriage.

708
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 And I wanted out.

709
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 We both wanted a divorce.

710
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 And we had to bring people in to help us.

711
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 And if you don't think that's a very bad consequence, I would have much rather had to take some pill to control an STD.

712
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 Or to support a child.

713
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 I would have chosen the other consequences.

714
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Over the one that I had.

715
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 But God's grace and the body of Christ rushed in.

716
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 And he changed us.

717
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And he helped us.

718
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 We've been married 20 years.

719
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 We have three kids.

720
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 And now, you know, we tell this story.

721
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 I'm going to pray.

722
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 I just -- I beg you, if you raised your hand.

723
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 If you raised your hand earlier.

724
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 Man, don't leave before you have a conversation with an amazing PORCH volunteer.

725
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 You say, "I want to be a 10.

726
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 How do I be a 10?

727
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 I don't need just head knowledge.

728
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 I want to fully understand how I can be a 10."

729
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 And we would love to let you know, God, would you help us in that.

730
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Thank you for your word that does not return void.

731
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 Thank you for this place and the leadership here.

732
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Thank you for the grace in going long.

733
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 And thank you for the gospel.

734
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 That makes us clean.

735
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 For new life.

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Second chances.

737
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 Thank you for imputing your righteousness on us.

738
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 As we believe fully upon your son.

739
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 His death and resurrection for the forgiveness of our sins.

740
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

741
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 If you're right now, you're in this place, you're like, man, I want to go from an 8 to a 10.

742
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 A 9 to a 10.

743
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 A 1 to a 10.

744
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 I just invite you forward.

745
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 You know, everybody is going to be looking at you.

746
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 But you know, there will be other people.

747
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And that will be the step you look back on for the rest of your life.

748
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 Say, I did something hard because I believed in God.

749
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Because I trusted in Jesus.

750
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And you may not want to.

751
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 There's a lot of hands, you know.

752
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 And it's game time.

753
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 You know, it's time to say, hey, I'm all in with this Jesus.

754
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Just come forward.

755
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Let us pray over you.

756
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 I love you guys.
