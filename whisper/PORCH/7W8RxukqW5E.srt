00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,020
 [Music]

2
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,020
 All right, welcome friends in the room.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,020
 Everybody tuning in online.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,020
 Get excited.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,020
 We are continuing this series.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,020
 There he said looking at shocking statements that Jesus

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,020
 said.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,000
 Let me read the passage we are going to be in tonight where

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Jesus said astounding things about prayer and asking and

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 talking to God.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 This comes from Matthew 7.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Starting in verse 7, Jesus is in the middle of sermon on the

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,020
 mount, one of the greatest if not the greatest sermon of all

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,020
 time.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,020
 And he's talking about prayer.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,020
 And he says this...

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,020
 Ask and it will be given to you.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,040
 Seek and you will find.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,040
 Knock and the door will be opened to you.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
 For everyone who asks receives.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 Everyone who seeks finds.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,040
 And the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,040
 Which of you if your son asked for bread would give him a stone?

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,060
 Or if you asked for a fish, would give him a snake?

25
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,020
 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,020
 gifts to your children, how much more will your father in heaven

27
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,040
 give good gifts to those who ask him?

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,040
 Ask and you shall receive.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,040
 Ask and it will be given to you.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,040
 What is Jesus saying?

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,040
 It kind of reminds me of a season in life.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
 Anybody engaged in the room in here?

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
 Yeah.

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
 Sore subject.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 Okay.

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
 Nobody elbow.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,060
 And please do not let that cause conflict later tonight.

38
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,060
 Just blame it on me.

39
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,060
 He said it cannot cause conflict.

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,060
 Those of you that are engaged, you are in a season where you

41
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,060
 get to experience what I think is one of the best parts if not

42
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,060
 the best part of being engaged which is called the wedding

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
 registry.

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,060
 What is the wedding registry?

45
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,080
 Well, this is whenever you and that special someone, that

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 special person get together and because you did the incredible

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
 thing of deciding to get married together, you now put a list of

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,100
 every gift that you would like someone else to buy you together

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
 and then send it out to your friends.

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
 It's pretty astounding.

51
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,100
 Because it's the only time in life where you can send a list

52
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
 of specified gifts.

53
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,100
 Hey, look, you don't have to give me anything but if you do, I

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
 would like it to be one of these.

55
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,100
 And you have not come across as entitled and like a brat that

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,100
 you are giving specific, here are the things we would like for

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,100
 you.

58
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,100
 We want a gift from you.

59
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,100
 And we have already picked out the gift we want to get from

60
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
 you.

61
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
 It's amazing.

62
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
 It's incredible.

63
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,120
 And if that wasn't good enough, at some point along the way, they

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,120
 added an element I think to make it better for the grooms who had

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
 to go through Bed Bath & Beyond and Crate & Barrel and wherever

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
 else one goes.

67
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 And it's this.

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 It's a laser gun.

69
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,120
 So you go in and they hand you a laser gun.

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
 You don't sit down and write a list and check it twice.

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,120
 They give you a laser gun and you go around the store playing

72
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,140
 duck hunt, shooting whatever you and your fiance would like to be

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,140
 a part of, you know, the gifts that people give you.

74
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
 It sounds similar.

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,140
 And the reason I bring that up, it's this idea of like, hey, ask

76
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,140
 put together the list of everything that you would like to

77
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
 receive.

78
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
 Bring your asks together.

79
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,140
 Let me give you a couple in case you are engaged.

80
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,140
 This is just for free while we're on the subject.

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,140
 Haven't done this in a while.

82
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,160
 Here's the things if you are engaged to take off of your list.

83
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 Okay.

84
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
 Number one, find China.

85
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,160
 You do not need -- the queen of England is not coming to your

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 house any time soon.

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
 Nobody needs teacups and all that.

88
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
 Find China.

89
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
 Another one that you do not need and I'm going to give you the

90
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
 best ones that you need is a juicer.

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 For whatever reason, fiancees come in and they're like, we need

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
 a juicer.

93
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,180
 You will not in marriage need a juicer.

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,180
 It's going to sit in that shelf and take up the very limited

95
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,180
 real estate that you have in that one-bedroom apartment.

96
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,180
 Okay.

97
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,180
 Another one, you don't need a popcorn maker.

98
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,180
 They got microwaves, bro.

99
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180
 You don't need an ice cream maker.

100
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,180
 These are things you're going to be tempted to register for and

101
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,200
 you will never, ever use them.

102
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 They will look back and they will just be relics.

103
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
 A waffle maker.

104
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
 You don't need a waffle maker.

105
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
 You're going to make waffles -- okay.

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 You're going to do it.

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 You're going to do it one time.

108
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
 You're going to put the chocolate chips in there.

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
 It's going to get mess everywhere.

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,220
 It's not going to look like any restaurant you have been to and

111
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,220
 you will put it up and never use it again.

112
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
 There are a few things, again for free and don't get in the

113
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
 message.

114
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,220
 If you are engaged, the list of things you should ask for should

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,220
 include some good towels.

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,220
 Okay.

117
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,220
 I don't know why I'm talking about this.

118
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,220
 But you're going to have those towels for years and years.

119
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,220
 People pick out some high quality.

120
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,220
 Number two, high thread count bed sheets.

121
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,240
 You spend a third of your life and you're going to be in that

122
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
 bed with her or with him.

123
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
 You want to make sure that you're sleeping on something

124
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
 comfortable.

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
 And number three, this is most important.

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
 Especially men, if you're engaged, you got to hear me on

127
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
 this.

128
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
 A robotic vacuum.

129
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
 Okay.

130
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
 We are living in the Jetson age now.

131
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
 And you get that robot vacuum.

132
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
 And here's what I have noticed about women.

133
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 They all have something in common.

134
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,260
 They love clean floors.

135
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,260
 I have never met one that doesn't love clean floors.

136
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
 You get the robot vacuum, it's not that expensive.

137
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,260
 You get it, you put it on your house, you set it, it cleans

138
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,260
 everything.

139
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
 You're going to be husband of the year.

140
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,260
 And I would like a little bit of credit.

141
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
 Okay.

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
 So add it to your list, robot vacuum.

143
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,260
 But whatever is on your list, you're going to be a husband of

144
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
 the year.

145
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,280
 And I say all of that because in a similar way, it seems like

146
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,280
 Jesus says that as Christians we are to put together as it were

147
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,280
 a wedding registry, a list of bringing all of your -- not

148
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
 wedding asks.

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
 But all of your asks to God.

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,280
 And he seems to say, and when you do so, you're going to

151
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,300
 receive.

152
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
 And I'm not saying that you're going to receive.

153
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
 I'm saying that you're going to receive.

154
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,300
 And when you do so, you're going to receive.

155
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
 Or is he saying that?

156
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,320
 Maybe better say, yeah, what are you saying, Jesus?

157
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,320
 We're to put together a list of things that we want and we're to

158
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
 bring them to you.

159
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,320
 And how do we make sure that we do receive what we're asking for?

160
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 So I want to walk through this passage as we're in the series.

161
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 And I want to sit and look at the shocking statement of Jesus.

162
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 Ask and you will receive.

163
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 Because I think there is two ways we misunderstand this

164
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
 verse.

165
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,340
 One is we think of God as -- man, it seems like Jesus is

166
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,340
 saying -- he's like genie from Aladdin.

167
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,340
 Rub the lamp, give the wish, going to get it.

168
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,340
 And that's not entirely what he's saying.

169
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,340
 Or it's not what he's saying.

170
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,340
 But the other way we often think of in prayer, we write it off,

171
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,340
 man, of course he's not saying, ask for things and you're going

172
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,340
 to receive them.

173
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,340
 Prayer doesn't work and every time I try it, it feels like

174
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,360
 God is going to do what he's going to do anyways.

175
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,360
 And I pray for 15 seconds and my mind is flooded with distractions.

176
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,360
 I don't know where you're at in the room but as it relates to

177
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,360
 prayer, I want to talk and break down what exactly Jesus is

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
 saying.

179
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
 Look at two ideas behind this idea.

180
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,360
 There he said it, ask and you shall receive.

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
 Two ideas from Matthew 7.

182
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
 I'm going to read and break down the verses again and we'll walk

183
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
 through it.

184
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 Jesus says...

185
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
 Now look at verse 8.

186
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
 So he just said ask and you'll be given, seek and you'll find,

187
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
 knock and the door will be opened.

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,360
 Now for everyone who asks, receive and the one who seeks,

189
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
 finds and the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

190
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
 He just said the exact same thing twice.

191
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
 And not only that, he essentially says the same thing

192
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
 three times twice.

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
 In other words, even the Greek word for ask and seek and knock

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
 are really not that different.

195
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
 But the first idea that Jesus is pointing out and hitting home is

196
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,360
 that you and I have been invited into a relationship where you

197
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 continually are bringing, God these are the things that I am

198
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 fearing and facing and the things that I feel right now.

199
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
 These are the wants that I have.

200
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,360
 And that you and I, if you are a follower of Jesus, have been

201
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,360
 invited into a relationship where whatever I am facing, I'm

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
 to talk to God about it.

203
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
 Talk to God about it.

204
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
 And so Jesus as it relates to ask and you'll receive, the

205
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 first thing he's hammering home is you are to be praying

206
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 continually.

207
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
 You know what's interesting?

208
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,360
 All throughout the New Testament, Jesus has a running

209
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
 theme of teaching this idea.

210
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
 Where on multiple occasions he tells stories and parables in

211
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 Luke 12 and Luke 18 right here where he's saying, go to God.

212
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
 Go to God.

213
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
 And in Luke 18 it says this...

214
00:09:40,360 --> 00:10:03,360
 If that wasn't enough, even think of the English translation

215
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
 of ask, seek, knock.

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 What is that spell?

217
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
 Ask.

218
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,360
 As though he could not be any more clear.

219
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 Bring those requests to God.

220
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
 Which is really important.

221
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,360
 Because often times in life, for most Christians and

222
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
 conversations I have with things they are afraid of, job

223
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
 interview coming up.

224
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
 Worried about a sickness in themselves or their family or

225
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 something in their life.

226
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
 And I will ask, have you prayed about that?

227
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,360
 No, I haven't prayed about it.

228
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 And when you think about it, it makes sense.

229
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 Why Jesus would say, God wants a relationship where you are

230
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 continually communicating.

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,360
 Where you are constantly in conversation with him.

232
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
 That he is saying, ask, go to God.

233
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
 Get your ask in gear and go to him and communicate.

234
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
 All right, send me the email.

235
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 I mean that as though you ask and ask and ask.

236
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,360
 And he's further saying that God's door is always open.

237
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,360
 Unlike today where when somebody knocks at the door, there is

238
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,360
 like a suspicion and it's kind of bizarre.

239
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,360
 For whatever reason in the last 20 years this changed.

240
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,360
 When I was growing up as a kid, people would knock on the door

241
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
 and you run to the door.

242
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 You are so excited.

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,360
 It could be Girl Scout cookies or neighborhood kid wanting to

244
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
 play kickball.

245
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
 And everybody freaks out.

246
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,360
 It's like -- why does DoorDash not just leave the food there.

247
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
 I don't need to hand off.

248
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
 Just leave.

249
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,360
 Even from the other side, you are looking through that peep hole

250
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,360
 in your apartment and I think he will leave it and go away if we

251
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
 wait long enough.

252
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,360
 We have a closed door policy and Jesus says God's door is always

253
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
 open.

254
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
 He's always there.

255
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,360
 And this is a context, really important context.

256
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
 When Jesus gives this sermon, he's trying to paint a picture to

257
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,360
 an audience that had some understanding of God.

258
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,360
 But saw him as some distant force.

259
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
 Someone that priests in the temple, which was very nearby

260
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 when Jesus spoke this.

261
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
 Where priests could go and talk to God and have a relationship

262
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
 and be near to God.

263
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,360
 And Jesus says, no, you have been invited into a relationship

264
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,360
 where you see God as father.

265
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 And where you understand he sees you as a child.

266
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,360
 His audience is having every category blown.

267
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
 I can talk to God?

268
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,360
 And not just that, like God hears me?

269
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 Over and over throughout even Matthew 6 when he teaches the

270
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 church, and he's right there, right before this how to pray.

271
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,360
 And he says, here's how you should talk to God.

272
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
 Father in heaven.

273
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
 Heavenly dad.

274
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
 Holy is your name.

275
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
 You are amazing.

276
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 You are incredible.

277
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,360
 Would you give me today's needs.

278
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,360
 When we even think about that, for whatever reason our brain

279
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,360
 translates it into old English and we don't hear what his

280
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,360
 audience is saying.

281
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
 Our father in heaven, Hallowood be your name.

282
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,360
 And King James version, his audience heard something very

283
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
 different.

284
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 Jesus saying, no, no, that's like a father.

285
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
 And he wants a relationship like a father with you.

286
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
 I know there is parts of my heart and my life and I think all

287
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,360
 of ours, that's so difficult for me to comprehend.

288
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,360
 Because think about the type of relationship a child has with

289
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
 somebody.

290
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,360
 Or a neighbor's kid has with somebody.

291
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
 Remember when you were a kid and thirsty and Mrs.

292
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 Johnson, would you mind if I had a cup of water.

293
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,360
 When it was your house, it didn't look like that at all.

294
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,360
 Hey, yo mom, we ain't got Capri Sun, can somebody go to Kroger

295
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,360
 and get Capri Sun, because we are playing video games.

296
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
 It was astounding.

297
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,360
 And the Bible hammers home, not in an irreverent way but you are

298
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
 my father in heaven.

299
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,360
 And that's the type of relationship he's invited you and

300
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
 I into.

301
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
 And some of you when you pray, God is saying ask, continually

302
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
 ask.

303
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 Bring those asks to me.

304
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 It's hard for you to compute that.

305
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,360
 Because you talk to God different than you talk to

306
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 people.

307
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,360
 And maybe it was because of the way you were raised or modeled

308
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
 and heard priests pray.

309
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 But when you do pray, you down shift into King James version

310
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,360
 like you are reading the declaration of independence or

311
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
 something.

312
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,360
 And not just God, man, I'm really anxious right now.

313
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,360
 I don't know if I'm going to get the job.

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
 And I feel like I'm just overwhelmed and honestly I'm still

315
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
 thinking about the last conversation that I had with

316
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,360
 my coworker and what they think about me.

317
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 You don't feel like you can have that type of honest dialogue.

318
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,360
 And maybe the best take away for some of us in the room is pray

319
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
 honest prayers.

320
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
 It's not like he doesn't know already.

321
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
 It's not like you didn't understand and see what you are

322
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
 feeling.

323
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 I was talking to a friend not long ago and I'm telling you, I

324
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
 think this is so pervasive in how we think.

325
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
 Where we try to reverse psychology on God.

326
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,360
 And I was talking to a friend, a girl serving here for years,

327
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
 amazing godly girl and single.

328
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,360
 And I'm struggling with singleness and I asked have you

329
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 prayed about that?

330
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
 What does that look like?

331
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
 She said, no, I feel like honestly I can't talk to God about

332
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
 that.

333
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 Because if I say I'm struggling with singleness, he's going to

334
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,360
 make me continue to be single until I'm okay with not being

335
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
 single.

336
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
 And I can't tell God that because if I tell God that, he's

337
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,360
 going to continue to make me single until I'm happy being

338
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
 single.

339
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,360
 You're crazy.

340
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,360
 It could be inside of all of our heads.

341
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,360
 We're like man, I can't -- you know, part of us just thinks, oh

342
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
 no, he doesn't really know.

343
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
 He knows all of it.

344
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 And Jesus says he's invited you into a relationship where you

345
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,360
 call him father.

346
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 What do I pray for?

347
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
 As it relates to go to ask and ask.

348
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
 It's very important.

349
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,360
 Anything you care about, you should talk to God about it.

350
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,360
 First Peter 5 verse 7 says cast all of your cares on God because

351
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
 he cares for you.

352
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 What do you think he means by cast?

353
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
 Like throw it out in the water?

354
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
 No, clearly he's saying bring all of those things to God.

355
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
 It's really beautiful, powerful verse.

356
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 Cast everything you care about to God.

357
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 Bring all of what you care about to God because you are what God

358
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
 cares about.

359
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,360
 Pretty profound.

360
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,360
 That anything that you're anxious about, anything you're

361
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,360
 feeling, any of those desires, man, I'm going to bring all of

362
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 those to God.

363
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
 God, I want to have a spouse.

364
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 Doesn't mean you're guaranteed you're going to get a spouse.

365
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 But it doesn't make you spiritual for pretending you don't want

366
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
 that.

367
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
 It makes you inauthentic.

368
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
 And he's invited you in a relationship where you see him

369
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,360
 as father and bring those requests to me.

370
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 Is he saying, this is important, that everything you ask for, you

371
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
 will get it.

372
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
 No.

373
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
 Thank God you were not saying that.

374
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
 Or else so many of us would be married to Stephanie from second

375
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
 grade right now.

376
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,360
 Or we would be like an astronaut or some other job that you are

377
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
 like this is all I want to be in life.

378
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
 No, he's not saying that.

379
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
 You will get an answer.

380
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,360
 And the answer will either be yes, no, or not now.

381
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,360
 The answer will be yes, no, or not now.

382
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,360
 When does God -- when is it an automatic yes?

383
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,360
 The Bible seems to say there's occasions where it's an

384
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
 automatic yes.

385
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,360
 And those occasions are where God's will for your life and

386
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,360
 God's desires align with our requests.

387
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,360
 Jesus says over and over again this idea that anything you ask

388
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,360
 in my name or according to my will, ask it and I will do it.

389
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:49,360
 John 14...

390
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:57,360
 John 15...

391
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,360
 And John 16 and 17...

392
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,360
 Does that mean we say, hey, Lord, I would like a Lamborghini

393
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
 in your name.

394
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
 Boom.

395
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
 No, that would be amazing.

396
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,360
 But no, it means whenever God's will, revealed will and sovereign

397
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
 will, when it intersects.

398
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,360
 Those are the times we understand it happens.

399
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
 But nevertheless he's invited us to a relationship where you

400
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 bring those things constantly to him.

401
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,360
 If you are in a dating relationship right now, you know

402
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 the things that weigh you the most down.

403
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,360
 Like your mom is sick or you are out of a job.

404
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
 Do you know the person you are dating about that one time?

405
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
 No.

406
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,360
 You are not like, oh, man, my mom is sick.

407
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 Okay, good.

408
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 We talked about it.

409
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
 We can move on.

410
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 You bring it.

411
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
 It's constantly there.

412
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 And he's invited us into a relationship where you can ask

413
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
 and trust him.

414
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 Then he goes into and answers I think a really important

415
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,360
 question that a lot of us are wondering whether we would put

416
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,360
 it in this way as it relates to -- when I ask and I don't get

417
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
 what I ask for.

418
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,360
 And I do get something I didn't ask for.

419
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 Is that because God is a bad gift giver?

420
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 Like remember that registry, when my wife and I registered

421
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,360
 for ours, we registered and filled it out.

422
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,360
 And inevitably this is going to happen if you are engaged, get

423
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
 ready for it.

424
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 I am telling you your future right now.

425
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
 Somebody will do what is called, I went off the registry.

426
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
 And they will buy a gift that you didn't ask for but they

427
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,360
 thought, you know what, I'm going to give them this.

428
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
 Which is always a gamble.

429
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 And oftentimes it's just because the person is just not very good

430
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
 at giving gifts.

431
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,360
 For example, with us, somebody gave us this gift and it was a

432
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 nativity set.

433
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
 Which is awesome.

434
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,360
 But it had Mary and Joseph and Jesus.

435
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,360
 Each of them were a foot and a half tall.

436
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 It was like a statue.

437
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,360
 I was like, oh, man, this is great.

438
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 And the worst part was, they were a well-off family.

439
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,360
 I am like, dude, I know this is like a $500 set that we can't

440
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 sell on eBay or do anything that is sitting on our attic right

441
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 now.

442
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,360
 And we didn't ask for it, they just went off the registry.

443
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
 And I am thankful.

444
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 I thought it was great.

445
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,360
 It's my wife, she doesn't like it if you listen to this.

446
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 It was just a reflection of, oh, man, why did you not just stick

447
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
 with the registry.

448
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,360
 The times when we get something we didn't ask for.

449
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 Because God is -- is he just not great at giving gifts?

450
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 And Jesus answers that in a really important way.

451
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,360
 As crude or comical as I am being about it.

452
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
 Here's what he says...

453
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,360
 Which of you if your son asked for bread would give him a

454
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
 stone?

455
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,360
 Jesus is talking.

456
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
 I'm going to talk to all the dads in the room.

457
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,360
 If you had a son come up and say, dad, can I have some bread.

458
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
 Would you give him a stone?

459
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
 Or if he asked for a fish, would you give him a snake?

460
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,360
 If you then, though you were evil, know how to give good

461
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 gifts to your children.

462
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
 And by evil he means in comparison to God.

463
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,360
 The best and worst earthly father in comparison to God is

464
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
 evil.

465
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
 Compared to a perfect, loving, holy God.

466
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 He says even the worst dad is not going to do that.

467
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 How much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to

468
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 those who ask him.

469
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,360
 And then he brings up bread and fish.

470
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,360
 Bread and fish was an incredibly common meal in that day.

471
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,360
 You read the New Testament and see multiple occasions where

472
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 fish and loaves or ate fish and had bread with it.

473
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,360
 Very common, not fancy or hors d'oeuvres or filet mignon.

474
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,360
 And the son comes up and says, dad, can I have some bread or

475
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
 fish.

476
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,360
 I just need to eat in order to live.

477
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 And Jesus is saying, just like in that scenario where a child

478
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 is saying, this is the bare need that I have.

479
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
 I'm bringing it to you, dad.

480
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 There is no dad out there, even the worst dad wouldn't be like,

481
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 you want some bread.

482
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
 Here's a rock.

483
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
 Here's a fish.

484
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 Here's a snake.

485
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 Nobody would do that.

486
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 It's crazy, comical.

487
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 I love these jokes.

488
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 And he's going, even the worst dad out there would not do that.

489
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,360
 And you by comparison are evil.

490
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
 Do you think God would do that?

491
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 He says, no, God only gives good things.

492
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
 He doesn't give all things.

493
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,360
 He only gives good things.

494
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,360
 The second idea I want to talk about this idea of ask and

495
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
 receive.

496
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,360
 It involves continually praying continually.

497
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
 That's the first idea.

498
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,360
 And the second one is equally as important.

499
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,360
 And that is trust constantly.

500
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
 As it relates to living the Christian life, there is a faith

501
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
 that is involved to walk through and hold on to the fact of the

502
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
 teachings of Jesus, which is he only gives good things.

503
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,360
 Which means if I experience a not good thing, it's either not

504
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,360
 from God and it's a part of living in a broken world.

505
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,360
 Or it is something that though I cannot see it right now, will be

506
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 good.

507
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,360
 Because God's not done.

508
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,360
 It is either not from God or it is something that one day I will

509
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,360
 see how despite the ways and times and feelings, why would

510
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
 this happen?

511
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,360
 I will see it and see that it was good.

512
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,360
 Because God, he only gives good things.

513
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 And if he goes off the registry of my asks and he gives me

514
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,360
 something I didn't ask for or he doesn't give me something I ask

515
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
 for.

516
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
 It's not because he doesn't love me.

517
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,360
 He proved that by dying on the cross and coming and dying for

518
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
 everything you have done.

519
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 And he doesn't care about you if he doesn't give you what you

520
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
 want.

521
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 And it's not because he can't.

522
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,360
 All powerful, created everything, he can do anything.

523
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,360
 The reason why is because he knows something that I don't.

524
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 So if I ask for something and I don't get it, it's not because

525
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,360
 he doesn't care and not because he can't.

526
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
 It's because he knows something that I don't.

527
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,360
 It's like this, my daughter is three and she's probably the

528
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 most beautiful kid in the world.

529
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 And I'm totally kidding.

530
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,360
 But what is not kidding, she would eat Cheetos and Pringles

531
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
 for every meal.

532
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
 Amen.

533
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
 Thank you.

534
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
 You are a people.

535
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 We're going to eat vegetables and try a piece of fruit.

536
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
 Anything other than Cheetos and Pringles.

537
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
 And she doesn't understand.

538
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 She will throw fits and say I want Pringles.

539
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,360
 Give me the Pringles.

540
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,360
 And you are about to get a spanking and she will starve

541
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,360
 herself until you give me the Pringles.

542
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,360
 She can't comprehend that you can't eat Pringles and Cheetos

543
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 for every meal.

544
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,360
 And the fact that you are angry at your parents because we won't

545
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
 allow you to do that.

546
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,360
 Because we understand something you don't, that's not a healthy

547
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
 nutritious diet.

548
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 You will be malnourished and at three you can't comprehend that.

549
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 But there's something you don't understand.

550
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,360
 And I'm not giving you Pringles not because I don't love you and

551
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 not because I don't have them.

552
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
 Because I know something you don't know.

553
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 I understand something you don't.

554
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 And could it be possible that in a very similar way, if a three-year-old

555
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,360
 to a 30-something-year-old, there's a breakdown in understanding

556
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,360
 that an infinite, holy, perfect, all-knowing, all-wise God could

557
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,360
 look at us when there's something we're saying, I want the Pringles

558
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
 of blank.

559
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,360
 And he says, it's not because I don't care about you.

560
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,360
 It's not that I couldn't give it to you.

561
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,360
 It's I know something you don't.

562
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 And you can trust me.

563
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,360
 I've shown I'm a God who will care for you and provide for you to the

564
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
 farthest length, even dying on a cross.

565
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:01,360
 I know in this room there are some times where life, and because it's

566
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:09,360
 a broken sin world, it feels like it just handed you a snake and a stone.

567
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,360
 And there are times where represented here, I know in this room right

568
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,360
 now, and listening at 14 different locations, you're walking through

569
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,360
 something and it feels like a snake and a stone.

570
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,360
 And some of it is because it's not from God.

571
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
 He didn't want it.

572
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 He didn't create it.

573
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 He didn't cause it.

574
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,360
 He may have allowed it.

575
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,360
 And the challenge emotionally is when you're walking through a chronic

576
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,360
 illness, when you're walking through a breakup, when you're walking

577
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,360
 through the loss of a parent, it doesn't matter if he caused it or if

578
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 he allowed it.

579
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,360
 I'm still walking through pain.

580
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,360
 And it's hard to understand how that's not a stone or a snake.

581
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,360
 And the Bible tells us that God has promised everything good comes from

582
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
 one place.

583
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
 That's him.

584
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 And for Christians, everything not good will be made good in eternity.

585
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,360
 That one day we will see it from a different lens and understand how

586
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,360
 right and all the brokenness and all the pain and all the suffering that

587
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,360
 he was working and bringing about good through it in ways that I'll never

588
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,360
 be able to understand and candidly I wouldn't even try or I would fail

589
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,360
 miserably to try to articulate in your particular situation with all the

590
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,360
 pain that you've walked through.

591
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,360
 How is God going to bring good about through that?

592
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,360
 This week is like I mentioned earlier, it's JD's birthday, which is

593
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
 awesome, so fun.

594
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,360
 It's also the anniversary of his dad dying in his early 40s of pancreatic

595
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
 cancer.

596
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,360
 Do you know how rare that is?

597
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:58,360
 How do you tell me that's anything but a stone or a snake?

598
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 And while I don't know all the ways God will bring about good through

599
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,360
 that, through your pain, I know that he has promised one day every tear

600
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,360
 will be wiped and I will make everything beautiful in its time.

601
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,360
 Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 11 says, he has made as in it's done, it

602
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,360
 will be done, everything beautiful in its time, that God will redeem

603
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,360
 everything that he allows.

604
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 Every chronic illness that many friends in this room have that you

605
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
 plead with God to take away.

606
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,360
 I can't even understand how he would use that or abuse, how he's going to

607
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,360
 take horrific things and weave them together for good.

608
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,360
 But he's promised that he will.

609
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 In Romans chapter 8 verse 28 it says a very common verse, we know that in

610
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,360
 everything, all things, God works together for the good of those who

611
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
 love him.

612
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,360
 Who have been called according to his purpose.

613
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,360
 I don't know what you're walking through but I know in this life or in

614
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,360
 the one to come you will see and I will see even the worst of things

615
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
 woven together for good.

616
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
 Maybe you're walking through a breakup.

617
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,360
 I remember one of the most terrible times of my life was a breakup that I

618
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
 had with my wife.

619
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
 We broke up and spent two years apart.

620
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 And I was in that stage and you know it, breakups, they're not the end of

621
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,360
 the world but the end of something that was a huge part of your world.

622
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,360
 And it feels like oh, man, just ripped the heart out of my chest and put on

623
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,360
 Brian McKnight songs and Taylor Swift and wondering why God, why did this

624
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
 happen to me.

625
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,360
 And we spent two years apart and ended up, we dated again and got married

626
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
 shortly after that.

627
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,360
 And that two years which I never would have asked for and pales in

628
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,360
 comparison to so much of the pain represented here.

629
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,360
 But God got a hold of my heart and deepened my faith and my knowledge of

630
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,360
 his word in a way that today I still pull from.

631
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,360
 I don't know who I would have been without those two years.

632
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,360
 And I look back and it was so painful and yet I'm so thankful.

633
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,360
 And I pretend to transfer that onto horrific pain that is represented here.

634
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,360
 Just saying like that and dozens or hundreds of other ways in my own life

635
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,360
 and lives of other people I've seen, I've seen God bring about good through

636
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,360
 tragedy, through pain, through heartache.

637
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,360
 Sometimes we can see it and someday we will see it.

638
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
 And we see it from above.

639
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,360
 I remember this, I was invited to a football game.

640
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,360
 Somebody had tickets and I got to go down and sit on the ground floor or

641
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
 sit on the floor.

642
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,360
 And I was walking around and seeing the game and halftime, it was college

643
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
 football.

644
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,360
 And marching bands come out on the field and do the marching thing.

645
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,360
 And if you have sat on the front row or on the field level, seeing the game

646
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,360
 and seeing the marching band is a totally different perspective.

647
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,360
 You can't quite see all that you can see if you sit in another location.

648
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,360
 So I'm watching the marching band and I see these guys come out and you have

649
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,360
 the tubas and trombones and clarinets and trumpets and all these different

650
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,360
 instruments and walking and going and it looks like they are walking right at

651
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
 each other.

652
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,360
 And you are like, oh, man, the tuba is about to take out that trombone and

653
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,360
 take a turn and make the sharpest turns and going all these angles.

654
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
 And you have drummers going everywhere.

655
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
 It looks chaotic.

656
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
 What is going on?

657
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,360
 It's like somebody kicked an amp pile of band kids on the field.

658
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,360
 And it just looks chaotic.

659
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
 You are seeing it like eye level.

660
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,360
 And then you look up at the jumbotron.

661
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:56,360
 And when you see it from above, you see there is purpose and beauty and

662
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
 order.

663
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,360
 And it's spelling out something.

664
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,360
 And everything that looks so chaotic when you looked at it on the ground

665
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,360
 level, so messed up.

666
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:16,360
 When you see it from above, there is purpose, intentionality behind all of

667
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 it.

668
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:22,360
 And I wish that I could connect the dots in your life of how that's going to

669
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
 happen.

670
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
 But I can't.

671
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,360
 But I do know it's going to happen if you are a follower of Jesus.

672
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,360
 And in the meantime, he's invited you to come and ask and know and bring

673
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
 all of those requests.

674
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,360
 And if he doesn't answer the prayer the way you want it, it's not because he

675
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
 doesn't care.

676
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
 It's not because he can't.

677
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,360
 It's because he knows something that you don't.

678
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
 I don't.

679
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,360
 Tim Keller who is a well-known pastor put it this way, he said God will give

680
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,360
 us when we ask him, we ask to receive.

681
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,360
 He will either give us what we ask or what we would have asked if we knew

682
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,360
 everything he does.

683
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,360
 God will either give us, God, will you take this away, will you bring a spouse

684
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,360
 in my life, will you take the sickness away, will you help me to finish school,

685
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
 will you provide a job for me.

686
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,360
 He will either give us those things that we ask for or what we would have asked

687
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,360
 for if we knew and could see everything that he sees.

688
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,360
 And in the meantime he's invited us, you can ask knowing.

689
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,360
 Your father in heaven, he only gives good things.

690
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,360
 So if it's not good, it's either not done or it's not from him.

691
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,360
 And he will bring about good eventually through it.

692
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,360
 I said earlier, just to wrap up, that the best thing about being engaged was

693
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 all the different presents that you get and the gifts that you receive when you

694
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
 get married.

695
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
 Really that's not true.

696
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,360
 The best thing about being married is not the fact that you're going to sit there

697
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,360
 and eventually you get married, you receive all those gifts, and you're sitting

698
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,360
 open in the toaster and for this person the waffle maker and for you whatever

699
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,360
 other things you added to your list.

700
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,360
 That's not the best part of being married at all.

701
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,360
 It's not the gifts you receive, it's the relationship you step into.

702
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,360
 And you know what's funny is as awesome as all those things you ask for are

703
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,360
 and everything you get, you enter into this relationship where all of them

704
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:29,360
 shrink and pale in comparison to the greatest gift which is her or a wife or

705
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
 him, a husband.

706
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,360
 And all the other stuff, it's nice and it's cool, but it's a joke to even put

707
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:44,360
 them on the same level, playing field of husband and gifts, receiving things you

708
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,360
 ask for.

709
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 I think there's going to come a day where all of us will see that the greatest

710
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:01,360
 gift, need, thing that we at our heart of hearts have ever wanted was none of the

711
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,360
 things that you've asked for, wished that God would do.

712
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
 It's always been him.

713
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,360
 It always will be him.

714
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,360
 I believe that because you know the same passage occurs in two different places

715
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,360
 in the New Testament.

716
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,360
 It occurs in Matthew chapter 7 and it occurs in Luke chapter 11.

717
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
 Exact same verses.

718
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,360
 Exact same words.

719
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
 With two exceptions.

720
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 Luke reads through and says...

721
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:40,360
 And then he says the same thing.

722
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,360
 Luke chapter 11, verse 13...

723
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
 Same exact story.

724
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,360
 Another occasion Jesus is teaching and he says...

725
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:23,360
 And Luke says...

726
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,360
 He loves giving good things, but you know what more than anything he loves?

727
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,360
 Giving the best thing, which is him.

728
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,360
 So much so that he would give his own life on the cross so that you would have

729
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,360
 the greatest need, desire, and ask that you will ever have, which is him.

730
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,360
 And candidly, the longer that I've just been doing this and the older that I get,

731
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,360
 the more that I see in life people going, as they deepen in their relationship

732
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,360
 with God, they discover all of the things that they think, "Man, if I just had that,

733
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,360
 I would be happy. If I just had that, man, life would be amazing."

734
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,360
 They begin to discover, you know, "I'm thankful that God has given me what he has.

735
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,360
 I'm thankful that he's given me a house or family and a car, but more than anything,

736
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,360
 I am thankful that I have him.

737
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,360
 More than anything that I want in God, I'm thankful for all the stuff that you've given me.

738
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,360
 More than any of that, though, I want you."

739
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,360
 Like I mentioned with my kids, I love giving them good things.

740
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
 I hope they have good things.

741
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
 I hope they have good lives.

742
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
 I hope they're healthy.

743
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
 I hope they get married.

744
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,360
 I hope they get to be a grandfather of their grandkids or of their kids.

745
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,360
 I hope that all of life goes well.

746
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:37,360
 But more than any of that, I hope that they know Jesus

747
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,360
 and they receive the greatest gift, the greatest need, and the greatest thing

748
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,360
 that they desire, whether or not they realize it, which is him.

749
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,360
 And that is a gift that if you ask for tonight, God has an amazing track record.

750
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
 When you begin to go, "God, you know what?

751
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,360
 I do need a car and I do need a job, but more than any of that, I want you.

752
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
 I want more of you.

753
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:04,360
 I want you and a deeper relationship with you," you will discover that is a prayer God loves to answer.

754
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,360
 And if you're in the room tonight and you have never invited or asked God,

755
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 "Hey, I'm asking you, Lord, for a relationship with you.

756
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
 I'm inviting and I'm asking."

757
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,360
 I'm beginning to think I was made for something more than just the American dream.

758
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 I was made for a relationship with you, God, and so I'm asking you,

759
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,360
 will you allow me to put my faith in Christ, receive the Holy Spirit?

760
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
 I want you. I want you.

761
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,360
 You will discover tonight the one you were made for,

762
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 the one who died on a cross for every sin that you've ever done and ever will do,

763
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,360
 who came back alive, who you came into this world with every breath,

764
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:48,360
 desiring whether you realize it or not, and you will die and breathe your last breath,

765
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,360
 having been made for him.

766
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:57,360
 And the reason you're here tonight is to receive that, because if you ask,

767
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:03,360
 you will receive the one you were made for, who has a name, Jesus,

768
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:11,360
 and God, who is willing and dying quite literally for you to know him.

769
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,360
 Let me pray.

770
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,360
 Father, I pray that you would allow any person who's never put their faith in Jesus

771
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,360
 to receive the greatest desire and ask and need that they have,

772
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:31,360
 which is not more stuff, it's not a different relationship status.

773
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
 It's you.

774
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,360
 And you would allow them to simply say, "God, I believe that.

775
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,360
 I know I'm not on my own. It's not working. I need your help."

776
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
 And I invite you. I'm a sinner.

777
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:48,360
 And I ask you for your help.

778
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,360
 And I receive through Christ forgiveness.

779
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,360
 Take my life.

780
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,360
 God, would you bless every person in here?

781
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:05,360
 Would you allow them to have favorite work, incredible marriages, incredible futures?

782
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,360
 But more than anything, would you give them more of you?

783
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,360
 That they would ask that for the rest of their days and receive.

784
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
 In Christ's name, amen.
