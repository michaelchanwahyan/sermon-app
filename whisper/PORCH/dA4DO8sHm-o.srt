1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 You, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 [Music]

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Some of the band is going to stay up here because we're going to do something a little bit different tonight.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 But just as we were thinking through election day and preparing for, you know, kind of an unusual evening,

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 there's a story that I was reminded of from God's Word.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 It's a story that's found in Joshua, chapter 3, and it's one of those stories that is such a reminder in Joshua and the people of God.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I'll explain even kind of the context for the book of Joshua.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 One of those moments where they were reminded, when things feel out of control and chaotic, remember, remember who your God is.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Remember that He's at work when you can't see it and you can't connect the dots.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Remember, everything in this world full of brokenness is still in His hands.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 If you're familiar with the book of Joshua, Old Testament is about the nation of Israel and God's relationship with the nation of Israel.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 God shows up in the book of Genesis to a guy named Abraham.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Father Abraham had many sons.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 God shows up, says, "I'm going to make a great nation out of you, the nation of Israel."

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Abraham has these 12 sons, and over and over -- or Abraham has one son.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 He has a son that has many, many sons.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And God builds this incredible nation, and He grows this people group.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 They find themselves in Egypt, and they're enslaved for 400 years.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And God had promised, "I'm going to build this great nation.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 You're going to have just this promised land that I'm going to give you."

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And 400 years go by, and a lot of the Jewish people are going, "Maybe God has forgotten us."

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I'm looking around, and all I know is slavery.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 All I know is being oppressed.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 It doesn't seem like we're the chosen people of God.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And if we are, I'm not even sure I want to be the chosen people of God.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And then a baby boy named Moses is born.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Moses grows up, and God says, "You're going to leave my people out of bondage."

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Moses goes. You may have seen the movie, "The Prince of Egypt."

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 He goes to Pharaoh and says, "Let my people go."

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Eventually, after a handful of plagues, the people of Israel are free.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 It's one thing to be free, but they don't have any place to go to.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 They're a nation of a wandering people group.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 They don't have a land.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And because of decisions that they made in ways they didn't trust God,

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 they wandered in the desert for 40 years, waiting to be brought into this promised destination.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 God said, "I have a place for the people of God."

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And Moses is like George Washington to the nation of Israel.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I mean, he's the guy who set them free.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 He's the guy that founded the nation.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He's the guy that gave them the law.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And they get up to the edge of the promised land.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 They're about to enter in. They've been waiting years and years.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Their great-great-great-great-great-grandparents have been waiting for this day.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 They get up to the promised land edge, and God says, "Moses, you're not going in.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Your time is done."

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And Moses passes away.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And God says, "Joshua, you are going to lead the people of God."

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Now, to us, we're like, "Oh, we get the story. Moses was cool and Joshua was cool."

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 This would have been huge shoes to fill.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 You're filling in for the George Washington/Abraham Lincoln combo,

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 the guy who would strike a--with his staff, a rock, and water would come out.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He parted the ocean.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 God threw him, parted the ocean with his staff.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I mean, those are big shoes to fill.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 If you're filling in for a guy who can tap rocks and make water come out, it's not an easy game.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And Joshua is told that he's going to lead the people of Israel.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And the nation is going, "Are we sure, God? We're almost in.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Like, just let Moses take us in."

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 And God says, "Joshua is going to take you into the Promised Land."

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And he gives him an order.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 He says, "Joshua, I want you to take the people,

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and I want you to walk up to the edge of this river that was separating them from going into the Promised Land."

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And the story that we're about to read, it reflects those moments of what you do.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 The reminder, Joshua is about to get in the people of Israel,

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 God, that God is always in control.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He's always at work.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And every little turn in the story is meant to point us to him.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 So Joshua is told, "Hey, I've got to get two million people,

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 and I want you to take them up to this river's edge called Jordan.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And on the other side of the river is the Promised Land.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You guys could march a long, long way around and not have to go through that,

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 but I want you to walk right up to the river's edge,

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 and I want you to look at the land that I'm about to give you."

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So Joshua goes, and he tells the people we're about to go to the river's edge,

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and then God gives him another command.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And here's what he says in Joshua chapter 3, verse 8.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 "Give this command, Joshua, to the priests, those who carry the Ark of the Covenant."

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 The Ark of the Covenant doesn't mean a lot to us.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 The Ark of the Covenant would have been the visible representation of God's presence to the nation of Israel.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 The most valuable thing they had.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 They held the Ten Commandments in there.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 The most valuable thing that they had, and it represented,

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 "Hey, God who exists is on our side. He's with us. His presence is here."

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 The most valuable thing we have.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And God says, "I want you to tell the priests to take the Ark of the Covenant,"

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 which is this big piece of wood or wooden box, if you will,

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "and when they reach the banks of the Jordan River,

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 take a few steps into the river and stop there."

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Joshua gives this instruction, and the priests must have thought,

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 "Wait a second. What? The new guy in charge is telling us to take the most valuable thing that we have

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 and step into, as we're about to see, a rushing river with it?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 A river that we can't possibly swim across or even get across,

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 and you want us to begin to walk out in the water?

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 What in the world?"

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 But Joshua gives them the command.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 This is what God said to do.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Verse 14, "So the people left their camp to cross the Jordan River,

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 and the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant, they went ahead of them.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 It was harvest season."

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Your translation may say, "It was flood season."

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 "And the Jordan was overflowing at its banks."

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 The Jordan River. Here's a map of the Jordan River, just so you can kind of see what's going on.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The people of God have been told, "Hey, we're going to cross over the Jordan River.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 At the very bottom of it is the Dead Sea, and there's somewhere right near the city of Jericho,

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 and they're on this side."

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And God says, "All the land to the left of the Jordan River is going to be yours,

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 and you're going to cross over it."

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But they come during the worst time of the year to come.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 God says, "You guys have been wandering for 40 years, and I want you right now

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 to go prepare to cross over the Jordan River."

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Why do I say it's the worst time? Because it was during harvest season.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 What does the river look like during harvest season?

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Here's a picture of today, during the flood season or harvest season,

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 where it is a rushing water, rushing more than 10 miles an hour.

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It swells from 50 feet wide to 150 feet wide.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 It's impossible to touch the ground.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 It just overflows during this one small window a year.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And God, it's not like he needed to go during that time.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 They've been wandering 40 years, and God says, "Right now,

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I want you to bring the people and take a few steps into the water

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 and tell the archer or tell the priest to move in to the Jordan River."

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And here's what happens.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 "As soon as the feet of the priests who are carrying the ark

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 touch the water's edge,

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 the water above that point began backing up

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 a great distance away at a town called Adam."

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 We can't find, side note, Adam on a map today.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 The only way we know it is because of the reference to the city it's by,

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 which is near Zarethan.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But the source of the water was coming from this town called Adam.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 "And as soon as the priest stepped in,

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 it began to be dried up at the source of the water.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 At that point, the water that was below flowed on to the Dead Sea

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 until it was just the riverbed."

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 This was not like the dividing water of parting the Red Sea,

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 if you're familiar with that, where Moses goes up and says, "Divide the water."

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 This was a moment where it would be like similar to letting the water out of a bathtub,

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 where just in a moment, priests step in.

139
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 They begin to see, "I think some of the water is coming out."

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 In other words, it stopped miles away.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Some scholars estimate it would have taken two hours

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 where the priests of the Ark of the Covenant are just standing there,

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 thinking like they're holding something that would have looked almost like a coffin,

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 or people bearing a coffin at his funeral.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And they're standing there for two hours, and they watch the water.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And Joshua's sitting there, newly elected leader, going,

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 "Man, I hope this works.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I really hope that was God talking.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 I don't know if that's the devil telling me to tell them to take the Ark of the Covenant

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 into the riverbed."

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And slowly but surely, the water dissipates.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Then all of the people, two million of them,

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 crossed over near the town of Jericho.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Lord's Covenant

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 stood on dry ground in the middle of the riverbed as the people passed by.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 They waited there until the whole nation of Israel had crossed by

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 on the Jordan, on dry ground.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So the nation, one by one, walk across

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 and are able to cross the thing that was keeping them

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 out of entering into God's promised destination for them.

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 The barrier is stopped because the Ark, this wooden box,

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 containing, symbolizing the presence of God,

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 allows the barrier to be removed.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And one by one, they walk over.

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And what happens next, we don't have time to go into,

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 but it's such a beautiful story.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 In Joshua chapter 4, they all get over to the other side.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 They're about to be in the promised land.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And God says, "I want you to remember

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 what I've done for you this day and what I do in general.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 So here's what I want you to do.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 While the riverbed's still dry, I want you to take 12 big, strong guys,

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 the guys you put on the football team, Joshua,

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 take those guys, tell them to go get 12 huge stones

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 out of the riverbed and pick them up.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And on the side where the promised land you're about to enter is,

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I want you to build a 12-stone monument.

178
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And here's why I want you to build it."

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It's so fascinating.

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 "I want you to put them and stack them up together

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 so that every time you and your children,

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and your children's children, walk by those stones and they go,

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 'That's kind of funny. Like, why are there 12 random rocks there?'

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 You tell them of what I did for you this day.

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 That your God provides, your God makes a way,

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 your God is the one you trust in, not yourself,

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 not your circumstances."

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And they build this memorial.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And then after that, the nation goes and they begin to make camp.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 They begin to set up campfires and they're putting their tents out

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 and you've got millions of people, as far as you can see.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 There's camels and there's horses and people,

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and they're setting up their kids and they're getting used to, like,

194
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 this is going to be where we're eventually going to live.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And Joshua is taking the whole thing in.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 He's still a little uncertain over what's going to happen next,

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 so he decides, "Man, I'm going to go scout out the land.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I just want to make sure there's no enemies nearby.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I want to go see what's kind of around us."

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And we're told that he leaves the camp.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 In Joshua 5, verse 13, it says,

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 "When Joshua was near the town of Jericho,

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 he looked up and he saw a man standing right in front of him

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 with his sword and hand drawn.

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Joshua went up to him and he demanded, 'Are you a friend or a foe?

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Are you with us or against us?'

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 The man replied, 'Neither one.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I am the commander of the Lord's army.'

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 At this, Joshua fell on his face to the ground in reverence.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 'I am at your command,' Joshua said.

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 'What do you want your servant to do?'

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 The commander of the Lord's army replied, 'Take off your sandals,

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 for the place that you're standing is holy.'

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Joshua did as he was told."

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 The commander of the Lord's army,

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 scholars have pointed out for years and years,

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 that most likely is the pre-incarnate Christ.

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 It's basically Jesus before Jesus came and lived on this planet.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 That it is the commander, it is the one, the ruler

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 of the Lord's army in heaven

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 and the ruler of this world.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And Joshua is looking face to face

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 with the angel of the Lord.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 The angel of the Lord says, "Take off your sandals."

225
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 I mean, when you read that, you're like, "That's kind of a funny thing.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 He's on holy ground because he's in the presence of God."

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 The angel, the commander, if you will, begins to explain,

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 "Hey, here's what you're going to do.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 You're going to go," and he gives him basically the marching orders,

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 "You're going to take down the city of Jericho.

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 This is the land I've promised you.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And you're going to go march around it."

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 You're familiar with that story, you've heard,

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 but they go out and they bring the marching band

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 and they march around the city of Jericho

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 and the wall's top of them.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And Joshua was reminded in that moment, out, just him,

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 looking at whatever that commander looked like.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Joshua, you think you're in control,

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 but there's ultimately one who is higher in authority than you.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And you may be the commander of things down here,

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 but there is a commander of all things under who you fall,

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 under whose authority you live.

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 He's the one who's over all authority at all times,

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 in all places, and everywhere, and you can trust.

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And ultimately, he's in command of the circumstances

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 and of the people and of the leaders in this world.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And Joshua learned the lesson that day.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He also learned that God has invited us in every circumstance

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 that we are to trust in him,

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 not to put our trust in our ability

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 and what we hope could happen

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 and what we and some other friends think could happen,

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 but to put our trust in him,

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 not in our giftings or our job or our health,

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 to put our trust in him.

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Why would you tell them to come up to the riverbank,

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 to come up to the Jordan River during the worst time possible?

259
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Other times you could possibly jump on top of a horse,

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 you could swim across,

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 you could do something to get the people across,

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and you tell them to come up to the riverbank's edge

263
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 in the midst of the single time during the year

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 where it would be impossible to cross,

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 unless you're involved, God.

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Because what he wanted to communicate to Joshua

267
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 and to the people of Israel, and to me, and to you,

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 is he's inviting you to live this life,

269
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 not trusting in your circumstances or yourself.

270
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 That is a recipe for continually being disappointed,

271
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 depressed, finding despair,

272
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 but put your confidence in my ability to provide.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Trust what I tell you to do,

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 and you'll experience my provision, my protection,

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 and the path towards the life that you want.

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 But you've got to trust and you've got to surrender to me,

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 and you've got to say, "God, if you say it,

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 "what I'm going to do, I'm going to do it.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 "No matter when things look crazy around me,

280
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 "I'm going to trust in what you say

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "and what you've done and who you are."

282
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And Joshua learned that day.

283
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 This is why some people, when they walk through life,

284
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 the more they grow in their faith and their trust in God,

285
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 it's like the more, no matter what they face,

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 they have this incredible peace that marks them.

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 They can face the worst layoff of all time,

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 and they trust God, and they're like, "God is good.

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 "I don't like this, but he's in control,

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 "and you know what, I trust him."

291
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And then there's other people

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 facing the exact same thing and they're freaking out.

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I went this past Friday, and we went on a double date,

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 my wife and I and some longtime close friends of ours,

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 and we went to Six Flags.

296
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 My wife's like, "Happy place is Six Flags."

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 She is one of those funny people who is like

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 so risk-averse in everything in life,

299
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 except for like the worst of all times rollercoaster.

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 She's like, "Yes, this is the greatest."

301
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And so we went to Six Flags, and it was Fright Fest,

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 which if you're not from Dallas,

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 even if you are from Dallas, it's a trip.

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And so we're there, we're at Six Flags.

305
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 It's like a fog machine overdose,

306
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 and we're getting ready to go on the rollercoaster rides,

307
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 and my wife is just freaking out.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 She's like, "Yes, let's go on the Superman, the crazy one,

309
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 "and then the Batman, Joker," and she just like loves it.

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And I'm with one of my close friends

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 who is like the entire, totally opposite.

312
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Like he's like, "I don't know if we should do that.

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 "I'm gonna go get like a funnel cake or something."

314
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And he's like looking at the ride, and he's like,

315
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 "Look, there's like a 16-year-old kid

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 "switching the button over here.

317
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 "And look, they've been closed six months.

318
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 "Who's done the maintenance on this stuff?

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 "Why would I even wanna pay to be freaked out right now?

320
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 "I could have a heart attack."

321
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 And just the contrast between the two of them

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 could not be any different where I'm like,

323
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 "Yo, bro, I mean, there's like a five-year-old

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 "in front of us in line.

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 "I think you're gonna be okay."

326
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And he's like, "I just, you know, it's not my thing."

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And the entire time, even on the ride,

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 where my wife is like, "It's so funny."

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And apparently this is like a thing, you know,

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I guess among people, but certainly among women

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 wired like my wife where they're like,

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 "No risk, but yes!"

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Freaking out, hands up in the air.

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And that was her, but on the same ride,

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 he was like, "Oh, no, no, no!

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 "I'm freaking out!"

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They were in the same circumstance.

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 They were literally sitting two feet apart,

339
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 experiencing the exact same rush,

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 the exact same speed, exact same velocity,

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 exact same turns, exact thing, everything.

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 One of them is totally at peace,

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and one of them is freaking out.

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 What's the difference?

345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 One of them trusts the roller coaster.

346
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 One of them trusts those who are behind

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 and those who put together

348
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 and those who created the roller coaster.

349
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 They trust the ride, and the other one doesn't.

350
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 This is why people can walk through

351
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 horrific circumstances.

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Many in this room that are representative,

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 people walking through, and it's like,

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 "I found out at 34 I've got breast cancer."

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Or somebody who finds out at 27,

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 "Hey, I've got a now autoimmune disease

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 "that's gonna impact me for the rest of my life,

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 "or I just lost my job from COVID.

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 "Everything that I've been saving up for is all gone."

360
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 But in that place,

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 despite the circumstances being terrible,

362
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 they go, "God's got a plan, and I trust Him."

363
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 "And He's gonna bring good about from this,

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 "and I don't like it, and I wouldn't have chose this,

365
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 "but I trust Him.

366
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 "I really believe He exists.

367
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 "He's real.

368
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 "He's at work, and I trust Him."

369
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And then somebody in that exact same circumstance,

370
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 and they're walking through,

371
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 and things aren't going the way that they want,

372
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 and they just collapse.

373
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Their faith falls apart.

374
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 What's the difference between those two people?

375
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 On the turns and flips of life,

376
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 one of them trusts the one who's behind all the movements,

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 and one of them doesn't.

378
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And Joshua's message that he received

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 could not have been more clear.

380
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Joshua, look at me.

381
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I don't want you.

382
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I don't want the people.

383
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I don't want anyone to trust in you

384
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 or to trust in Moses

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 or to trust in anything that you can do.

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I want you to trust in me,

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 not in your leader, not in your abilities,

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 not in how well you can speak,

389
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 not in how well things are going,

390
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 or how terrible.

391
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 I want, look at me, Joshua.

392
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Trust in me.

393
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And that message rang loudly to the nation that day.

394
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And we live in a world where we are constantly,

395
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 even as Christians, being told to put our trust

396
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 in something else.

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And the message over and over in Scripture is,

398
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 hey, no matter what happens,

399
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 you do not have to fear the terror of the night,

400
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 as Psalm 91 says.

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 You are to trust in me.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Put your confidence.

403
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 I got it.

404
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 I'm in control.

405
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 No matter what happens, no matter what you face,

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 listen to me, I got you.

407
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You can trust me.

408
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Trust what I've said in my word.

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Do these things.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I don't let you down.

411
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 When you live obediently to me,

412
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 you're going to see it was worth it.

413
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It was better.

414
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 You can trust me.

415
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And no matter what happens in an election day,

416
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 at a local level, at a state level,

417
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 at a national level, any of those things,

418
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 God is in control.

419
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 No one sits in the White House who ordains

420
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 or is over all things.

421
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 That is a role uniquely taken by God.

422
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And there's a leader for every national leader,

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 and Joshua that day looked him eye to eye.

424
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 And let me be clear, one day,

425
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 if you're a follower of Christ,

426
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 you're going to see him eye to eye.

427
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 You're going to see the ultimate leader,

428
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 the King of Kings, the leader of leaders,

429
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 whose name is Jesus, who in Revelation,

430
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 you're going to see him eye to eye,

431
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 and it says his eyes are like fire.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And all people will see.

433
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 There is only one name.

434
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 There's only one leader.

435
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 There's only one person worthy of your worship,

436
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 of living obediently to,

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 and following and trusting with your life,

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 and his name is Jesus.

439
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Joshua, whose name, oddly enough, means Jesus.

440
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I mean, Yeshua is the Hebrew name for Jesus.

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Yeshua is the Hebrew name for Joshua.

442
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Joshua saw it that day.

443
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And we've been invited as a people of God,

444
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 no matter what's going on,

445
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and I know no matter who wins an election tonight,

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 there's going to be a lot of people upset,

447
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 a lot of people hurt, a lot of people confused,

448
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 or sad, or any of those things.

449
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 God has said, "Don't put your confidence in man.

450
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Put it in me.

451
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 You can trust me."

452
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 The hope for Christians

453
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 is ultimately in the one

454
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 who's over command of every heart in a second.

455
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 God could save, if Joe Biden wins,

456
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 God can save and awaken,

457
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 if he hasn't had a relationship with Jesus,

458
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 in a moment, he can make every single senator,

459
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 every single president, every single mayor,

460
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 every single governor,

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 all of them radically followers of Jesus.

462
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And shame on me,

463
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 or shame on anyone who doesn't fully believe that

464
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 and have faith that that can happen.

465
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 In a moment, he could do the same thing with Donald Trump,

466
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 he could make him, in a moment, say,

467
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 "I'm going to radically capture your heart,

468
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 and you're going to surrender to me,

469
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 and you will not be a ruler of this land

470
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 who's not ruled by me in your heart."

471
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And he can do that.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And as people of God, we've been reminded,

473
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 we have access to the one who's in command of all things,

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 and we can rest there.

475
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I love that he didn't say, "I'm on your side."

476
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 I mean, he's talking the nation of Israel.

477
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 If anybody, Joshua, should be like,

478
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 "Hey, are you on our side or are you on their side?"

479
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And he's like, "Look, I'm not on either side.

480
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 You need to wonder if you're on my side."

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 That's what he says.

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Tony Evans said such a great line,

483
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 that, look, as a reflection of this,

484
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and this, you know, essentially being Jesus in the text,

485
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 that, hey, Jesus didn't come to take sides,

486
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 he came to take over, and he's going to take over.

487
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So you don't need to worry if he's on your side,

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 if he's on the side of Republicans,

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 if he's on the side of Democrats.

490
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You need to make sure you are on his side.

491
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And you think through the lens of what is God's side

492
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 as it relates to policies and issues and all that stuff,

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 all of which is important, but the question is not,

494
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 he's not here to take a side, he is here to take over,

495
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 and we as the people of God need to make sure,

496
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 man, I want to be on his side.

497
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And what he cares about, I care about.

498
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Ultimately, the story of Joshua

499
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 and the people crossing over the Jordan River

500
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 doesn't just, in the text, point to, like,

501
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 how God is the leader of leaders.

502
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It points to the text, how this story is about something

503
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 so much bigger and so much more important,

504
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 and I'm about to close down,

505
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 and we're going to have a chance to pray.

506
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 This story is about, almost like no other story

507
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 in the Old Testament that I know,

508
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 in every turn points to Jesus.

509
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 It's shocking.

510
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And if you read back through it and you think about it,

511
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 almost in every way imaginable, you see the fingerprints.

512
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 This story, the entire time, it was all pointing to Jesus.

513
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 It's all pointing to him.

514
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 What do I mean by that?

515
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You have a leader named Yeshua,

516
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 which is the Hebrew name for Jesus.

517
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 If Joshua lived and Jesus lived in the Greek translation,

518
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 it would have been Jesus.

519
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And this man shows up, and God says,

520
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I'm going to have you be the one through whom

521
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 the people of God are able to enter into

522
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 the promised destination that I have for them.

523
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Much like us being promised that through the leader of Jesus

524
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 we could enter into eternity, Joshua,

525
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 you're going to, through you, be the person

526
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 who allows them to enter into the promised land of God.

527
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And how are you going to do it?

528
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Through a piece of wood.

529
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 The separation from the people of God

530
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and the promised destination of God.

531
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 The separating barrier will be overcome by a piece of wood,

532
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 and that wood is going to stop that barrier

533
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 all the way back to its source, Adam.

534
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Much like the people of God,

535
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 by trusting in Jesus Christ and the work he did

536
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 on a piece of wood called a cross,

537
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 where he was crucified, and he was killed

538
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 for your sin and my sin, and by trusting in that,

539
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 the barrier of the separation from us and eternal life

540
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 through that piece of wood is no longer

541
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 something that keeps or has to keep

542
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 anyone from having eternally

543
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 the ability to spend life with God.

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And he's going to cut it off

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 all the way back to its source, Adam.

546
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 The Bible says it's sin, and everything sinful

547
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 and broken in our world comes from the source

548
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 of Adam and Eve and the garden, all of that sin.

549
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 It's all been tracing.

550
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And Jesus shows up, and through the work that he did,

551
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 through a piece of wood, stops all of it back

552
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 all the way to the source.

553
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 He pays for every sin everywhere,

554
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 and he removes the barrier so the people of God

555
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 don't have to be separated from him.

556
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And every turn, it points to Jesus.

557
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 The one who told Joshua that day,

558
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 "Take your sandals off. You stand on holy ground."

559
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And let me be abundantly clear.

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 All of life points to Jesus,

561
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 or it's Jesus' attempt, it's God's attempt,

562
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 no matter what you're walking through,

563
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 and as challenging as it is,

564
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 for you to have his attention,

565
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 or for God to get your attention,

566
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 to look to him.

567
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Then no matter what you are walking through,

568
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 trust in me.

569
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Trust in me.

570
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And in every page, in every turn,

571
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 all throughout the story, it's clear to see,

572
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 it was always pointing to him,

573
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 the God who, through a piece of wood,

574
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 and a leader named Yeshua, or Jesus,

575
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 would make a way for the people of God

576
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 to enter into the rest,

577
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 and ultimately, to enter into eternity with him.

578
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Our confidence as Christians

579
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 has nothing to do with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,

580
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 which is where the White House is.

581
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Our hope and our confidence has everything to do

582
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 with a cross and a crucifixion

583
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 that happened right outside of the Jerusalem walls

584
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 2,000 years ago,

585
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and then three days later,

586
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 when the only election that mattered,

587
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 when Jesus was called out of the grave,

588
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 conquering death.

589
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And I love this country.

590
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 I love America.

591
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I got American socks on right now.

592
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I love America.

593
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 But America is not our hope.

594
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 And our hope as Christians

595
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 doesn't come from the stars and stripes

596
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 on the American flag.

597
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 It comes from the scars

598
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 on the hands of our Savior,

599
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 and the stripes on his back,

600
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 that for all of eternity,

601
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 show us the lengths to which God was willing to go

602
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 for you and for me,

603
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 and the reason why you can trust me,

604
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 no matter what happens,

605
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 and what's ahead.

606
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 So what we're gonna do right now

607
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 is take a chance to do something we've rarely done,

608
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 and I just want to invite us to pray.

609
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 I'm gonna ask you, if you're comfortable,

610
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 in just a second,

611
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 and you're okay,

612
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 and there's no physical reason why you couldn't,

613
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 or you're okay with doing so,

614
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 we're just gonna hit our knees.

615
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 We've got spread out, we've got spaces,

616
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 and you can just turn, and we can hit our knees.

617
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And we're gonna pray specifically for a few things.

618
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 This is a crazy, it's a crazy time.

619
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And I want you to pray for both presidents or candidates.

620
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 I want you to pray for Joe Biden

621
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 to have a deep, abiding relationship with Jesus.

622
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And if you just left the Trump rally,

623
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 and you're like, "I hate that guy."

624
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 If you don't want Joe Biden

625
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 to spend eternity with Jesus,

626
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 there is something deeply wrong with you.

627
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 If you're on the opposite spectrum,

628
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 and you're like, "No, I can't believe you would even say,

629
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 "pray for Trump."

630
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 If you don't want President Trump

631
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 to spend eternity with Jesus,

632
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 there is something deeply wrong with you.

633
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And neither, wherever they sit in this life,

634
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 matters way less than where they will spend eternity.

635
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And so we're gonna pray for both of them,

636
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 that God, you would save them.

637
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 You answer prayers all the time.

638
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And we're gonna storm heaven and just say,

639
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 "Would you save these men?"

640
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 If they have a relationship with you,

641
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 would you kindle it so that it would be

642
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 the guiding force in their life,

643
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 how they tweet, how they pass policy,

644
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 how they do everything?

645
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And then I want you to pray for elected officials

646
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 just across the board, mayors, senators.

647
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 If you live in Fayetteville, those in Arkansas.

648
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 If you live in Boise, Idaho, pray for those in Idaho.

649
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 If you live in Houston, pray for those in Harris County.

650
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 If you live in Philadelphia, pray for those in Pennsylvania.

651
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 If you live in different locations that are tuning in,

652
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I just want you to pray for elected officials

653
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 that God would have rulers who are ruled by him

654
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 leading in our country.

655
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And then I want you to pray for the church,

656
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 that in the midst of the chaos in this world,

657
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 that we would be strong, we would be salt and light.

658
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 There's a lot of hurting people.

659
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 There's a lot of people that don't have work right now.

660
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 There's a lot of people that can't afford to pay,

661
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 pay their mortgage, they can't feed their kids.

662
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 I'm not sure they'll ever have life

663
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 the way that they thought life was supposed to look back.

664
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And the church and our opportunity to care for all people

665
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 has never been greater.

666
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And listen to me very closely, policies matter.

667
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 We should talk about the economy, that stuff matters.

668
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 We should talk about race relations,

669
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 that stuff matters, biblically, from a race.

670
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 The most significant thing about a person

671
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 is whether they're gonna spend eternity with Jesus or not.

672
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Economy, both if you are rich and if you're poor,

673
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 you need Jesus, both alike.

674
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Policies matter.

675
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 We should talk about COVID and getting a vaccine,

676
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 but here's the reality, vaccine or not,

677
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 everyone is going to die and spend eternity somewhere.

678
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 And there is no vaccine that can save anyone

679
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 from the disease of sin.

680
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But there is a cure.

681
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Jesus is extended, and so we're gonna pray

682
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 as the church of Jesus Christ,

683
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 that God, would the gospel go forward in our land,

684
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 would revival break out, would you start in our hearts,

685
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 and would you save people, and would the church be strong,

686
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 because there is gonna be a huge opportunity

687
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 to give the world the peace it's looking for,

688
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 the hope it's looking for,

689
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 the fighting for rights it's looking for.

690
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Those things don't just fall out of the sky

691
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 and come from nowhere,

692
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 but they're clearly represented in the Bible

693
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 and the text and the Christian perspective on the world,

694
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 so we're gonna pray that the church,

695
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 like never before, would spread like wildfire.

696
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And then I'm gonna close this in prayer,

697
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 we're gonna sing a couple more songs.

698
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 But just right now, I wanna invite you,

699
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 if you're comfortable, to storm the gates of heaven,

700
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 a few thousand of us all around this campus,

701
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 those listening elsewhere,

702
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 if you would just be comfortable getting on your knees,

703
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 spending time praying for presidents or candidates,

704
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 other local leaders, and for the church.

705
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And then I'll pray and bring us out of it.
