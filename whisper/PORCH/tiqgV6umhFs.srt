1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:26,240
 - All right, let's go, new series, come on.

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,040
 Hey, welcome friends in the room,

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,400
 in Nashville, Phoenix, Austin, Tulsa,

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,680
 wherever you're tuning in, Houston, El Paso,

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,120
 friends up north, we are kicking off

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,840
 a brand new series, Instagram Theology.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,920
 Hey, who is on Instagram in this room?

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,080
 Who's not on Instagram in this room?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,080
 Oh man, more than I would have thought.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,280
 You guys need to get with the program here, people.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,400
 It's like the new Facebook,

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,400
 only your Aunt Carol is not on there.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,280
 And hey, for the next handful of weeks,

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,600
 we're gonna look at Instagram Theology.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,520
 What is Instagram Theology?

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
 We're just gonna explore some of the more popular

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,720
 cultural sayings and mantras

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,960
 and put them up to the lens of scriptural truth.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,160
 Let me start it like this.

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,680
 I not long ago was coming back from a trip,

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,240
 a vacation my wife got to go on,

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,600
 and we were flying back from being out of town,

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,560
 and we got on the plane and we sat behind this couple

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
 that also looked like they were coming back

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,520
 from being on vacation.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,160
 They were in their 20s, probably like 25, 26,

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
 somewhere around there.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,160
 And it looked like boyfriend and girlfriend,

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
 and they sat down right in front of us

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,760
 and were waiting on the tarmac

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,440
 or waiting for the flight to go off.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,820
 And the girl pulls out her phone

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,520
 and she just begins to look through

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,240
 the pictures of her vacation.

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,800
 And I'm not trying to be like creeper stalker.

37
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 She's just like right in front of me,

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,600
 and I'm like, okay, well, Stingray and her,

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,160
 and she's just going through everything that she did.

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,760
 Then she's going through pictures of her and her boo

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,640
 on the beach, and she pulls up an app,

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
 and I had never seen this before.

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,960
 She pulls up this app and she begins to take

44
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,440
 one of the photos of her vacation,

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,840
 and she begins to alter the photo.

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,820
 Like it's something called Facetune, apparently,

47
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,760
 which is a thing.

48
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,020
 Men, it's a thing.

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,740
 And she pulls this up and she begins like,

50
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,220
 she's like adjusting her waist somehow.

51
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,980
 She's able to like almost airbrush her face

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,200
 to make it look smoother.

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,420
 She's like whitening her teeth.

54
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,980
 And I'm sitting there like watching this.

55
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,420
 This lady's a total fraud.

56
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,220
 This is a photo fraud.

57
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,500
 What is she doing?

58
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,160
 She's enhancing the way that she looks.

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,660
 I mean, and it worked.

60
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,700
 She looked better in the picture

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,580
 than she was looking in this thing.

62
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,380
 And I mean, it's just true.

63
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,640
 She was like, and I'm like, dude,

64
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,560
 this lady sits on a throne of lies.

65
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,080
 This is unbelievable.

66
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,040
 So I did what any person would do.

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,280
 I followed her on Instagram,

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,400
 and then I commented on her picture.

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
 You sit on a throne of lies.

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
 (audience laughing)

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,920
 I didn't do that at all.

72
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
 I didn't do that.

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,320
 But I was sitting there going, oh my goodness,

74
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
 what are you doing?

75
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,560
 This is not at all reality.

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
 I mean, there's some things that kind of look the same,

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
 but there are some things that this is not who you are.

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,320
 Lady, you are projecting and throwing out this image

79
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,200
 of yourself and posting out there on Instagram,

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,860
 which is what she did next.

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,700
 That is not entirely reality.

82
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,360
 This is definitely not the whole truth.

83
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,560
 The hair color is the same.

84
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,580
 The people in the picture are the same.

85
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,940
 The moment didn't change

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,620
 or whatever they were doing on the beach there,

87
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,360
 but the whole truth was not being seen.

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,780
 It was a partial truth at best.

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,580
 And the reason I start there is because in that same way

90
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,260
 that she was putting out there

91
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,700
 a partial version of herself,

92
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,160
 but really just a partial truth.

93
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,740
 There were some things changed and doctored and edited.

94
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,660
 This series is us examining how oftentimes in culture

95
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,200
 and oftentimes on Instagram,

96
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,580
 people will throw out kind of like partial truths

97
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,420
 that have a little bit of truth to them.

98
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,380
 And I'm not talking about a picture.

99
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,980
 I just mean like sayings and hashtags

100
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,700
 and kind of lingo that people will throw out there

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,260
 that has some truth to it.

102
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
 It's just not the whole truth.

103
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,700
 And what we wanna do for the next handful of weeks

104
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,860
 is look at some of the more popular versions of those

105
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,860
 or popular expressions that people have,

106
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,620
 like love is love, speak your truth, hear for it,

107
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,460
 tonight good vibes only, love yourself,

108
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,960
 listen to your heart, and begin to go like,

109
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,580
 man, what is the actual truth?

110
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,220
 There's like a little bit of truth in that,

111
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,500
 but there's also just a little bit of where it's twisted.

112
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,380
 And that's not the whole truth that you are posting about

113
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,460
 and throwing out there to the rest of culture.

114
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,300
 And begin to go like,

115
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,800
 what would God's word actually say about this idea?

116
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,480
 So tonight, we're gonna take on the very first one

117
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,760
 as it relates to good vibes only,

118
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,920
 which kind of captures a lot of what Instagram is

119
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
 in general.

120
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
 People post and go to Instagram

121
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,940
 in order to kind of get good vibes.

122
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,780
 Nobody's on there like,

123
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,860
 I'm just looking for someone to make me depressed.

124
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,480
 Ironically, despite the fact that that's kind of

125
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
 what ends up happening when you look at

126
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
 everybody's highlight reel.

127
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,280
 But you go on there and it's kind of like good vibes

128
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,800
 and positive things that people are posting

129
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,040
 about their workout and the smoothie

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,440
 and this inspirational quote that I found earlier today.

131
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,960
 And the idea of good vibes only,

132
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,800
 if you've never heard that expression,

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,840
 it basically is something that people will say

134
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
 and they're like, dude, hey,

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,700
 I just don't need that right now.

136
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,560
 Sometimes you say it in response to a roommate

137
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
 who comes home, wants to tell you about how their boss

138
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
 was so dysfunctional, you're like, hey man,

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,480
 don't need it, good vibes only right now.

140
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,440
 I don't need that negativity in here.

141
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
 I'm trying to work on something positive,

142
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
 positive in, positive out.

143
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
 And people just try to like maintain

144
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
 a positive atmosphere around them.

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,200
 And there's something about that

146
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,880
 that I can almost get on board with.

147
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,560
 You know, the Bible says in Philippians chapter four

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,760
 that whatever's true, noble, pure, right, good,

149
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
 think about those things.

150
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,220
 So there's kind of an element of truth in it.

151
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,560
 But the reality is all of us,

152
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
 even if we want to have good vibes,

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
 we know that that's not an experience

154
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,720
 that can always be a part of our life.

155
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,840
 But when it gets tricky is that there is a Christian version

156
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,320
 of good vibes only.

157
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,120
 There's some like cultural Christians,

158
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,880
 like culture has its own good vibes only,

159
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,240
 and Christianity and in the church today in America,

160
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,560
 there has been some expressions of our own style

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
 of kind of good vibes only.

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
 Hey, good positive things only.

163
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,440
 And they often are attached to like,

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,840
 man, if you just believe enough good things,

165
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,220
 God has got good things in store for you,

166
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,440
 God's got good coming your way,

167
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
 I'm believing for good this year in you,

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
 your job, your relationships, your family,

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,560
 your money status, all those things

170
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
 are good things coming to you.

171
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,840
 And if you just believe enough and have enough faith

172
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,660
 and you live the right type of life,

173
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,920
 those things are headed your way,

174
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,200
 you just need to hold on.

175
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,440
 And there's some expressions in particular

176
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,240
 where the church is believing some partial truths

177
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
 that contain a little bit of truth,

178
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,480
 but it also contains a little bit of a lie.

179
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,120
 And if you and I are not careful

180
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,480
 to know what those lies are,

181
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
 you are gonna set yourself up.

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
 In other words, if you believe the three myths truths

183
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,280
 or the three partial truths

184
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,880
 that we're gonna talk about tonight

185
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,500
 that are widely pervasive,

186
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,360
 you are gonna set yourself up

187
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,260
 to experience depression, despair,

188
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,880
 a Christianity that doesn't work

189
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,380
 because it's not Christianity,

190
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,120
 and experience a relationship with God

191
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
 that is defined as anything

192
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,460
 but like a healthy functioning relationship

193
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
 as the Bible would describe.

194
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,360
 And tragically, at least one of the myths truths

195
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,680
 or at least one of the partial truths

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
 that we're gonna look at

197
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,560
 is responsible for sending people to hell

198
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,160
 because it doesn't align with what God says,

199
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
 what the actual gospel is,

200
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,400
 and what is actually true.

201
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
 So we're gonna look at the three partial truths

202
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,760
 that are the Christian variations

203
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,960
 of this kind of good vibes only,

204
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,260
 good life only, good things only coming to you,

205
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,100
 and we'll go through this.

206
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,020
 So these are gonna be three partial truths

207
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,700
 aligned with three of what I would call

208
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,840
 the Instagram bio Bible verses.

209
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,680
 You know what I mean by that?

210
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,700
 These are the Bible verses

211
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,960
 that people will put 'em on coffee mugs,

212
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,320
 people will put 'em in Instagram bio,

213
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,600
 and three of the most kind of popular verses out there

214
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 that are often some of the most misapplied verses out there

215
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
 or wrongly applied verses that are out there.

216
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,880
 So the first one, the first partial truth

217
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,800
 is a partial truth,

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
 what I would just call the prosperity gospel.

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
 What do I mean by that?

220
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,160
 The prosperity gospel basically says this,

221
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,280
 that God, at the end of the day,

222
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
 hey, if you wanna follow God,

223
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,600
 and this is infiltrating in some significant ways

224
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,520
 in the church in America.

225
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
 If you wanna follow God, here's what you need to know.

226
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,840
 God, he's for you, he's good, he loves you,

227
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,880
 you are gonna have a healthy, wealthy, happy life.

228
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,220
 That is what God's will for you is,

229
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,480
 that is what God wants for you,

230
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
 that is what is coming,

231
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
 and if you don't have those things,

232
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
 it's 'cause you don't have enough faith

233
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,200
 or because you are not inside of the will of God,

234
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,660
 so you need to check yourself

235
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,360
 because that is what God wants for you.

236
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,760
 And it's a partial truth.

237
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,160
 The reason why it's like, hey, man,

238
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,220
 there's kinda something true in that,

239
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,760
 but there's also kinda something not true in that.

240
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,040
 And what do I mean by that?

241
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,820
 There is kind of a truth in that

242
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,900
 it's not like God is out there

243
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,960
 not wanting your life to prosper.

244
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,000
 It's not like he's sitting in heaven and being like,

245
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,920
 I can't believe how well these people are doing,

246
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,120
 unbelievable, so there is some truth.

247
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,160
 It's not like he's radically opposed to that,

248
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
 but it is not the entire truth

249
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
 because it sells itself short in saying like,

250
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
 at the end of the day, you know what God wants for you?

251
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,160
 He wants you to be wealthy, he wants you to be healthy,

252
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,960
 and this is what, if you follow God, is in store for you,

253
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,080
 and it just doesn't align with the Bible.

254
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,940
 The Instagram verse of this, if you will,

255
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,820
 the Instagram bio verse, if you will,

256
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,580
 which is actually a verse in case you're like,

257
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,460
 am I making this up, is Jeremiah 29 11.

258
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,400
 It's a very famous verse.

259
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,280
 You probably have heard it before.

260
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,820
 And it says this.

261
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,340
 For I know the plans that I have for you,

262
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,440
 declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you,

263
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,020
 plans to give you a hope and a future.

264
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,380
 So people will take this verse,

265
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,900
 and you broke up with your girlfriend,

266
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,940
 and he's like, hey, it's okay.

267
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,360
 Look, God says, Jeremiah 29 11,

268
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,660
 that he has a plan for you, he has a plan to prosper you.

269
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,260
 I know you just lost your job, but he has a hope,

270
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,060
 he has a future, he has good things coming for you.

271
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,660
 You need to hold on, because that's what God has for you.

272
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,460
 That's in my Bible, and people will say that,

273
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,100
 and it's like, oh, okay, that's good.

274
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
 But it falls short of actually rightly applying that verse.

275
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,200
 That God's goal in even saying that at that time

276
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,860
 was not that you would be wealthy

277
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,860
 and healthy and happy, ultimately.

278
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,300
 In other words, when that verse was written,

279
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,900
 that's not what it meant to them,

280
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,660
 let alone what it means to us today.

281
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,780
 The context of that verse,

282
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,420
 just we're gonna read it here in a second.

283
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,980
 If you read around what that verse and when it was written,

284
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,260
 it was written by the prophet Jeremiah,

285
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,620
 and here's what was basically the point

286
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,740
 that was taking place.

287
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,220
 There were people that were in exile.

288
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,340
 What does it mean to be exiled?

289
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,180
 Basically, there was the nation of Israel

290
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,420
 and the city of Jerusalem kind of got conquered.

291
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,920
 So this conquering empire called the Babylonians,

292
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,460
 they came in, conquered Jerusalem,

293
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,640
 and they were like, here's what we're doing.

294
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,920
 We're taking exiles, prisoners with us.

295
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,540
 We want the top 10%.

296
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,380
 So they went around and kind of like just called it,

297
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,780
 like everybody in the top 10%,

298
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,100
 the prettiest people, smartest people,

299
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,700
 you're all coming with us back to Babylon.

300
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,260
 So people lost their family members,

301
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,100
 they lost people that were close to them, their dad.

302
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,820
 People were just taken away and sent into exile in Babylon.

303
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,900
 And the nation of Israel were like, dude,

304
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
 they just took, it'd be like if Canada came

305
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,300
 and conquered America, which would be hard,

306
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,140
 but they came in and they were like,

307
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,020
 we're taking the top 10% back to Montreal,

308
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,360
 you're all coming with us.

309
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,780
 And you're sitting there as American,

310
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,740
 you're like, dude, this is so sad.

311
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,200
 I have to go to Montreal, I guess,

312
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,040
 if I wanna see my family.

313
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,200
 Are they ever gonna get to come back?

314
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,360
 And people began to go, you know what,

315
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,640
 I'm sure God is gonna bring them back.

316
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,440
 And we're told false prophets started showing up,

317
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,860
 being like, you are the nation of Israel.

318
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,960
 God is gonna give you a destiny and a future,

319
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,620
 and he's bringing them back

320
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,880
 and giving these false promises.

321
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,260
 And Jeremiah writes a letter to the exiles,

322
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,420
 and he says, hey, don't buy it.

323
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,640
 Get comfortable.

324
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,000
 You're staying in Babylon.

325
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
 And here's what he says, and inside of that

326
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,800
 is where he writes the verse that I just read,

327
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,720
 Jeremiah 20 and 11.

328
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 Here's what it says.

329
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,960
 Do not, verse eight, Jeremiah 29.

330
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,880
 Do not let the prophets and fortune tellers

331
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,920
 who are with you in the land of Babylon trick you.

332
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,840
 Do not listen to their dreams.

333
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,160
 They are telling you lies in my name.

334
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
 I have not sent them, says the Lord.

335
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
 This is what the Lord says.

336
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,680
 You will be in Babylon for 70 years.

337
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,200
 But then I will come and do for you

338
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,080
 all the good things that I promised,

339
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,920
 and I will bring you home again,

340
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,360
 for I know the plans that I have for you, says the Lord.

341
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
 They are plans for good, not for disaster,

342
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,000
 to give you a future and to give you hope.

343
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
 The context of that verse was Jeremiah saying,

344
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,920
 hey, people are saying you're coming home.

345
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,320
 You're not coming home.

346
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,380
 Get comfortable.

347
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,480
 Seek the welfare of the city that you're in,

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,880
 but put down roots.

349
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,200
 You are not coming home.

350
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
 In fact, some of you guys are not even gonna live

351
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,640
 for 70 years, like your kids or your grandkids

352
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,760
 are gonna be the ones that are brought back.

353
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
 And yet we plucked that verse and we're like,

354
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,340
 here's what this verse means.

355
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,860
 It means that God has a future for you to be healthy

356
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,700
 and wealthy and happy,

357
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,000
 and that is the will of God for your life.

358
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,500
 And it's twisted.

359
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,380
 It makes the epitome of what prosperity

360
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,980
 and the prospering that God wants so worldly.

361
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,400
 And it really aligns with what the world would say

362
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,780
 is blessing in terms of God.

363
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,720
 And it is a partial truth that robs,

364
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,540
 actually what God says is actual blessing,

365
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,100
 which is having a relationship with him,

366
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,560
 having health in your relationship with him

367
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,920
 and having health in your relationship with other people.

368
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,440
 But this is all over Christianity in our country today.

369
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,920
 Some of the most popular preachers in America

370
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,700
 will put forward this stuff.

371
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,940
 And it is tragic because it is selling a lie

372
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,740
 that does not come from the Bible.

373
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,720
 One of the more popular people,

374
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,620
 and I don't exhaustively study a ton of these guys,

375
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,220
 but there are just sound bites that come out

376
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,560
 where it's like, man, that is at best misleading.

377
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,900
 There's a guy named Joel Osteen.

378
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,940
 And Joel, I don't know Joel,

379
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,980
 and I hope his heart is good,

380
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,860
 and I hope he loves Jesus

381
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,620
 and has an amazing relationship with him

382
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,940
 and all kinds of positive things.

383
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,380
 But he wrote in a letter

384
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,900
 that was published by the Washington Post this,

385
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,060
 that God wants to prosper us financially.

386
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,900
 He wants us to have plenty of money

387
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,000
 to fulfill the destiny he's laid out for us.

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
 That is at best misleading,

389
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,420
 or is it worse, intentionally misleading,

390
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,320
 and he is lying to people.

391
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,500
 And there are people all over our country

392
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,980
 who are saying, like, this is what God wants.

393
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,180
 He wants you to be healthy and wealthy and wise,

394
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,100
 so give us your money

395
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,860
 and God will give you 10 times as much back.

396
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,100
 And it is a lie.

397
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,460
 And it belittles the message of Jesus.

398
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,220
 It belittles the message of the Bible.

399
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,540
 It belittles the God who is there.

400
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,740
 There's also people who say, like, you know what,

401
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,100
 hey, you know what, God wants for you,

402
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,060
 wants you to be healthy.

403
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,140
 So if you're not healthy,

404
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,740
 it's because something you're not doing enough,

405
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,060
 or maybe people haven't prayed for you,

406
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,660
 or the right person hasn't come along

407
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,420
 to extend the gift of healing.

408
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,180
 God can heal people.

409
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,900
 He does all the time.

410
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,140
 But the will of God is not always healing for you.

411
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,500
 I was hanging with a friend a couple weeks ago,

412
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,060
 and he was talking about a woman in his church

413
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,340
 who has been in a wheelchair for 20 years.

414
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,380
 She was a model at the age of 25, she had a stroke.

415
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,180
 She's been in a wheelchair ever since.

416
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,060
 She said, almost every single day,

417
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,940
 people will come up to me in Christian circles,

418
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,700
 and they say the same thing over and over and over again.

419
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,300
 Imagine if this was you, sitting in a wheelchair.

420
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,540
 Hey, I need you to know I got a word from the Lord.

421
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,580
 This year is gonna be your year of liberation.

422
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,780
 The year of jubilee is here.

423
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,700
 You're gonna be set free.

424
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,020
 This is the year you're gonna walk,

425
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,300
 and let me just pray over you right now

426
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,140
 that that would happen.

427
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,460
 And she kindly said,

428
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,180
 I almost do the same thing every time.

429
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,020
 I say, hey, that's great.

430
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,900
 Let me pray over you, though.

431
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,180
 Because God has made this wheelchair into a throne

432
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,900
 by which I get to proclaim,

433
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,340
 despite the fact that I cannot walk,

434
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,900
 that the God who's there is good.

435
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,820
 He is for me.

436
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,500
 He could heal me at any time,

437
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,220
 but I don't worship him because he heals me.

438
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
 I worship him because he's God.

439
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,840
 And there are all types of people

440
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,800
 who are putting forward that what it looks like,

441
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,900
 if you really follow God, if you really had enough faith,

442
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,860
 you would be healed, and that is a lie.

443
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,580
 And it is not how the Bible says God operates,

444
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,340
 and sometimes the most God-exalting thing

445
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
 is not that you get up and walk.

446
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,020
 It's that you can't, and you still say,

447
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,340
 he's king, he's good, he's alive.

448
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,020
 And that's what the Bible teaches.

449
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,300
 And anybody who tells you something

450
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,700
 that is inconsistent with that is lying to you.

451
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,620
 Ultimately, the prosperity gospel, if you will,

452
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,820
 that, hey, man, just follow God

453
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,660
 and everything will be great for you,

454
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,940
 it makes this weird relationship

455
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,900
 where you don't actually worship God.

456
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,620
 You kind of worship what he can give you.

457
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,460
 It's like this.

458
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,340
 When I was in college, I dated a girl for,

459
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,900
 we went on a few dates,

460
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,060
 and it was one of those times where you're like,

461
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,020
 I don't know that I really see this going anywhere.

462
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,060
 And then I found out who her family was.

463
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,380
 And her family had a town named after them.

464
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,900
 Like, they owned the town.

465
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,020
 And it was like, dude, wow, they were well off

466
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,940
 at a level I had never experienced before.

467
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,740
 And so I'm like, oh, man, well, if I continue in this,

468
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,380
 I guess I'll get to go on the private jet.

469
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,500
 I'm hanging out on a PJ.

470
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,820
 They could go on a family vacation.

471
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
 It's like, that could be cool.

472
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,300
 Thankfully, I didn't really move forward with it,

473
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,620
 but think about all the reactions

474
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,260
 that every girl in this audience just had.

475
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,220
 Oh, my gosh, that is so unbelievable.

476
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,580
 You are a gold digger, huh?

477
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,860
 You would be right.

478
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,060
 If I was just in the relationship,

479
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,580
 not 'cause I actually liked her,

480
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,920
 but 'cause I was like, yeah, I mean, she's okay,

481
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,180
 but really nice house.

482
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,580
 You would say, that is so messed up.

483
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,240
 That's what the prosperity gospel is.

484
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,180
 It's like, hey, you know, God is kind of cool,

485
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,080
 but really, what he can give me is what I am after.

486
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,940
 You don't worship God, you worship his stuff,

487
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,100
 and it is a false teaching

488
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,760
 that many have fallen for, tragically.

489
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,460
 The second partial truth that is spreading,

490
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,940
 honestly, probably even quicker in our day and age

491
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,140
 is what I would just call the positivity gospel.

492
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,040
 The positivity gospel, what do I mean by that?

493
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,460
 It's almost this type of Christianity

494
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,020
 that is very focused on self-help, and you can do it,

495
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,080
 and no weapon formed against you can stand,

496
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,040
 and this motivational kind of pep rally,

497
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
 let's all come together,

498
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,360
 and you're gonna defeat it this year,

499
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,720
 and you're gonna conquer it this year,

500
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,280
 the promotion's gonna be yours,

501
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,680
 and I'm just gonna believe it enough,

502
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,800
 and if you believe it enough,

503
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,200
 then it will be what happens in your life.

504
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,800
 And again, it's so dangerous,

505
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,480
 'cause it's just like a partial truth.

506
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,200
 There's something true about that.

507
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
 There's something true about, man, God,

508
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,360
 the one who is in you is greater

509
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,440
 than the one who's in the world.

510
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,080
 That if you walk in dependence on him,

511
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
 there's no limit to what God could do.

512
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,220
 Like, there's something true,

513
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,260
 but where it gets distorted

514
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,160
 is it begins to make promises that God never made.

515
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,620
 It begins to make promises that are not what God says,

516
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,800
 ultimately, this is, I'm promising,

517
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,020
 flourishing at your job,

518
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,260
 or you're gonna get married this year,

519
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,020
 or promises that are not things that God says,

520
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,860
 man, I've promised this to you.

521
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,540
 Let me give you an example.

522
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,200
 Oftentimes, people will do this.

523
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 The dangerous thing about all three of these partial truths

524
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
 is that people take Bible verses

525
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,200
 and they try to support it with it.

526
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,880
 See, this is what God said.

527
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,720
 This is how you can know

528
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,760
 that this is gonna happen for you this year.

529
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,620
 And people will take Bible stories and do the same thing.

530
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,460
 What do I mean?

531
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,280
 It'll be like this.

532
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,120
 It'll be like, hey, you know what?

533
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,900
 Just like David slayed the giant of Goliath

534
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,740
 and he put him to death,

535
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,340
 this year, the God, he's told me he has a word for you.

536
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,980
 You are gonna put to death the giant of singleness.

537
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,700
 He will not arm against you, no weapon formed against you,

538
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,360
 so stand, you will prosper,

539
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,920
 and any door God closes will be a window he follows up with

540
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,120
 because that's how my God works.

541
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,000
 And your setback will be a setup

542
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,840
 for what God is gonna do to bring success.

543
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,640
 Turn to your neighbor, say success.

544
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,520
 (audience laughing)

545
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,660
 Dude, I'm out of breath.

546
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,400
 (audience cheering)

547
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
 Wow, that's actually a lot harder than I thought.

548
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
 (audience laughing)

549
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
 I gotta start jogging.

550
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
 And it is a lie.

551
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
 It's ridiculous.

552
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,080
 It is motivational, it's inspiring,

553
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,400
 and I'm like, yeah, it's gonna be a setup, setback.

554
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
 I can't wait.

555
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,840
 And then I leave and I'm like,

556
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,720
 I don't know what that actually means

557
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,120
 and I don't know what to do with that.

558
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,360
 And I think he just promised that I'm gonna get married

559
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,960
 and get out of debt in the next month.

560
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,460
 Wow.

561
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,800
 And then it doesn't happen.

562
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,120
 And then oftentimes it's like,

563
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,160
 well, this is 'cause you didn't have enough faith.

564
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,080
 And it is making promises that God never made in his name.

565
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,320
 And it is tragic.

566
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,160
 And I'm all about positivity.

567
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,640
 Like my number one on Strength Finders, positivity.

568
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,360
 I'm a seven on the Enneagram.

569
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,880
 I don't like thinking about negative things.

570
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,100
 I like thinking about positive things.

571
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,940
 Let's go there.

572
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,960
 But when you begin to love life

573
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,560
 that buys into this lie

574
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,780
 that God has promised certain things

575
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,440
 or that begins to focus on yourself

576
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,080
 and I'm more than a conqueror in Christ

577
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,640
 and I'm gonna take down this thing, I'm getting a promotion.

578
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,700
 You are buying into things and holding them as promises

579
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,560
 that God never said he promised to you.

580
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,460
 He promised in this world you're gonna have trouble.

581
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,740
 Not that you're gonna get a promotion.

582
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,660
 And what happens whenever you begin to go,

583
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,820
 man, I'm gonna believe God promising for me

584
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,640
 to get a promotion this year, I'm believing for that,

585
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,480
 that's what he's told me, and then it doesn't happen.

586
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,340
 It's like, I guess God's a liar.

587
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,440
 I don't know if this whole thing works.

588
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,940
 Maybe there's something wrong with me.

589
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,420
 And my heart breaks for the number of Christians

590
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,500
 who have walked away from the faith because of that reason.

591
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,900
 And God is there going, I never promised that.

592
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,940
 I promised that I'm enough.

593
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,380
 No matter what you face, what you walk through.

594
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,420
 One of the more popular verses

595
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,980
 that people in this same kind of vein

596
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,380
 of positivity and self-empowerment, and you got it,

597
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,740
 will pull out is Philippians chapter four, verse 13.

598
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,820
 That I can do everything through Christ

599
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,500
 who gives me strength.

600
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,700
 This is in every Christian school's gym on the wall.

601
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,460
 This was on Tim Tebow's eyes.

602
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,820
 It really captures the football faith

603
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,180
 of like, we're gonna beat 'em for Jesus, let's do this.

604
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,760
 And it doesn't reflect what Paul

605
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,980
 was actually saying in the verse.

606
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,020
 Ironically, he was saying the opposite of,

607
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,100
 hey, we're gonna win because God will give us strength.

608
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,740
 He was saying, no matter what happens,

609
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,700
 if I win, if I lose, if I'm rich, if I'm poor,

610
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,420
 no matter what I face, I can handle it all

611
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,860
 because of Jesus, he's enough.

612
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,460
 The verses say this, the context around it.

613
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,460
 I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything.

614
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,700
 I have learned the secret of living in every situation,

615
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,900
 no matter what I face, whether I'm with a full stomach,

616
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,540
 empty stomach, whether I have plenty

617
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,260
 or if I have very little, I can do everything

618
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,780
 through Christ who'll give me strength.

619
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,060
 So if we win or we lose, Jesus is enough.

620
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,500
 If I'm single, if I'm married, Jesus is enough.

621
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,520
 If I don't get the job, if I lose my job.

622
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,860
 If I get a promotion, Jesus is enough.

623
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,420
 And Paul, he grew in his relationship

624
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,720
 'cause he said, I learned the secret.

625
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,780
 As in, this wasn't an overnight thing.

626
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,300
 As I've grown in Jesus, I've learned,

627
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,980
 no matter what is happening on the outside,

628
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,660
 I can be okay on the inside.

629
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,860
 And it's not because I'm promised victory in every way.

630
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,540
 It's because Jesus is enough.

631
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,860
 He's worthy, he's worth it, and he's enough.

632
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,160
 And no matter what I face, even if I'm hungry,

633
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,960
 I can go through it because I have this connection

634
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
 with Christ that is so real and tangible.

635
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
 It surpasses anything I face in this life.

636
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,800
 It's pretty astonishing.

637
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,280
 But he says, that is what is part of any person

638
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
 as they grow in their faith and their relationship with Jesus

639
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,080
 that is what begins to happen inside of their life.

640
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,540
 Ironically, Paul wrote this from a prison jail cell.

641
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,860
 That I can do anything, I can handle anything,

642
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,060
 even being in jail for my faith.

643
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,860
 And we've taken it and we've made it a pump-up verse

644
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,020
 attached to promises that God never made.

645
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,220
 Two tragedies, I think, happen on this.

646
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,180
 The first, I've already kind of alluded to,

647
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,780
 is that we miss out on showcasing to the world

648
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,440
 even when things go really badly,

649
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,400
 Jesus is Lord.

650
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,140
 As powerful, like I said, as that woman getting up

651
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,740
 and walking, or as powerful as you having everything

652
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,660
 that you want in life and God bringing the healing

653
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,540
 and making it happen, it's almost more powerful

654
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,580
 for someone to go through and say,

655
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,800
 "He hasn't taken the cancer away,

656
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,420
 "and I don't know how much longer I've got.

657
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,700
 "I don't know how many more chances I've got,

658
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,260
 "but Jesus is enough and I believe him."

659
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,080
 When that happens, it almost takes your breath away.

660
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,580
 I know it does for me.

661
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,100
 Whenever somebody has the cancer go away,

662
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,880
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah, cool, chemo worked."

663
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,000
 But when they stand there and they look at me,

664
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,780
 and they're like, "I don't know if it's gonna happen, man,

665
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,660
 "but I've never felt more close to Jesus.

666
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,320
 "I've never felt more alive.

667
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,920
 "He's enough."

668
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,100
 It's breathtaking.

669
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,240
 And in making promises or in saying,

670
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,420
 "Man, ultimately, God just wants you.

671
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,060
 "You're more than a victor," and judging success

672
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,860
 by whether or not things go the way that we want them to,

673
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,080
 it removes our ability to showcase him

674
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,840
 even in hardship and pain.

675
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,820
 The second thing is it teaches people to bank on promises

676
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,480
 that God never made so they can leave.

677
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,960
 And here's the most appealing thing.

678
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
 Dude, if we wanted to blow up the porch

679
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,280
 and just begin to fill up every stadium out there,

680
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,400
 we would just begin to go self-help, positivity,

681
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,080
 everything's gonna be great, good vibes only,

682
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,400
 you've got it, you've got what it takes,

683
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,680
 this is what God's got for you,

684
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,640
 and just go over the top

685
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,040
 because it really is something all of us are going,

686
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,040
 "Man, that is so encouraging, and I wanna hear that."

687
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,560
 But the tragedy would be we would be filling our hearts

688
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,000
 with promises that God didn't make and filling it.

689
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,400
 And so whenever life and tragedy happens

690
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,900
 and things don't go the way that you want them to,

691
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,160
 you're holding on to something that was bankrupt, empty.

692
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,400
 You're like, "Man, I was banking on something

693
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,960
 "that never worked or never

694
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,880
 "could have been there when I faced tragedy."

695
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,000
 Let me give you an illustration and say what I mean.

696
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 We moved a couple years ago from where we live now

697
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,760
 and moved into our house now from our old house.

698
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,220
 And while we were doing that, we do what you do.

699
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,240
 You pack up your house

700
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,320
 and you begin to pack everything up.

701
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,280
 And I was packing up underneath the kitchen sink

702
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,040
 at our old house, and I came across our fire extinguisher.

703
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,040
 And I knew that our fire extinguisher was in there

704
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,320
 and knew that, man, if there was a fire,

705
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,240
 that had kind of been in there

706
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,320
 even before we moved in the home,

707
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,360
 and hey, we got that, and we'll go grab that,

708
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,820
 and we'll be all ready.

709
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,920
 And as I was packing things out and moving it,

710
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,640
 pulled out the fire extinguisher,

711
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,160
 and I realized, oh no, it was empty.

712
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,080
 It was rusted out and it was expired.

713
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,360
 Had a fire come, the thing that I was banking on

714
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,180
 to kind of bail me out, and this will be the thing

715
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,600
 that, you know, worst come, if bad scenario happens,

716
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
 house on fire, I'm gonna go grab this thing,

717
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,460
 and I would have found it empty, not helpful,

718
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,040
 and unable to help me face the fire.

719
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,140
 That's what people who hold onto these empty,

720
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,380
 Bible-less promises,

721
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,820
 that everything you know you want,

722
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,940
 if you're positive and have enough faith, it will be yours,

723
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,140
 that is what happens when they face tragedy,

724
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,380
 and they face heartbreak,

725
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,740
 is they're holding onto an empty fire extinguisher.

726
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,640
 I can't help them,

727
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,780
 'cause it's not coming from the word of God.

728
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,820
 Finally, the final partial truth,

729
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,640
 as it relates to this good vibes only

730
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
 kind of Christian edition,

731
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,480
 is what I would call the partial truth promised upgrades,

732
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,840
 and this looks like this.

733
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,760
 Hey, when things don't work out, you didn't get that job,

734
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,560
 it's because there's a better job coming.

735
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,280
 When you didn't get that, or your relationship broke off,

736
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,160
 and you guys didn't make it,

737
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,920
 it's because she wasn't the one God has someone better

738
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
 out there for you.

739
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,480
 It's this kind of promised upgrades,

740
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
 and when things don't go how we want them to,

741
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,100
 it's because God has a better something out there for you,

742
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,820
 and again, it's got a partial truth in it,

743
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,220
 and it's probably the most pervasive partial truth

744
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,220
 believed and really expressed inside of this room,

745
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,340
 but the partial truth is that God does have something better

746
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,040
 in terms of his plan,

747
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,740
 but he doesn't promise that he's got a better job for you.

748
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,340
 Like when things fall apart,

749
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,580
 or when your relationship breaks up,

750
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,100
 it's not true to say, you know why?

751
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,420
 'Cause God has a better someone out there.

752
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,980
 She's out there, and she was not the one,

753
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,860
 and good riddance to her, 'cause we've got another one

754
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,100
 we're gonna look for now.

755
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,100
 That's not helpful, and it's not true.

756
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,940
 If I was to say that to you,

757
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
 I would just be like kind of saying stuff,

758
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,660
 'cause I'm like, I don't want you to feel bad,

759
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,060
 so here's an empty promise,

760
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,540
 and the truth is, the truth would be honestly like,

761
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,460
 hey man, you guys broke up,

762
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,140
 God may not have anyone else out there for you.

763
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,380
 You may be alone and single for the rest of your life.

764
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
 That's the truth.

765
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,340
 I'm not saying you should lead with that,

766
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,140
 I'm just saying that's the truth,

767
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,220
 but God has something better, has a better plan.

768
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,620
 He has a plan, he loves you, and he's for you,

769
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,020
 and you can trust him.

770
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,800
 So I can't in good faith or biblically say

771
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,660
 when you lose your job, you know why you lost that job?

772
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,860
 'Cause God has a better job for you.

773
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,580
 You may not have a better job coming your way.

774
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,980
 You may work part-time at McDonald's, and that's great,

775
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,860
 and it may be a way worse job than your last job.

776
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,200
 Maybe that's what God has for you.

777
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,780
 Again, I'm not saying you should lead with that,

778
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,620
 but that is the truth.

779
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,180
 He hasn't given these like promised upgrades all the time,

780
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,960
 but he has promised, and I'm gonna look at the verse

781
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,420
 where people, you may be going like, wait a second,

782
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,660
 I thought he promised it's always gonna work for good,

783
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,420
 we're gonna look at that verse, but he hasn't promised

784
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,220
 he's gonna work for good according to your

785
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,100
 definition of good, or he's always gonna bring about

786
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,700
 upgrades in terms of your life.

787
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,100
 The way, or the reason, sorry, the verse

788
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,260
 that most people will pull this from, and well-meaning,

789
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,340
 people aren't doing it maliciously,

790
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,740
 they've just kinda heard people say things like that,

791
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,740
 but it's not biblical, and they pull it from

792
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,960
 Romans chapter eight, verse 28, the final Instagram

793
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,020
 bio Bible verse, if you will, which says this.

794
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,020
 And we know that in all things, God works for the good

795
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,340
 of those who love him, who've been called

796
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,660
 according to his purpose.

797
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,540
 So we hold onto that, we take out, he works for the good

798
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,500
 of those who love him, God is always working for good,

799
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,220
 so if I end up, my parents split apart,

800
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,060
 it's because God has a better plan, he's gonna bring 'em

801
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,100
 back together, if my roommate moves out,

802
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,220
 or we lose the lease, it's 'cause God has a better

803
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,940
 apartment set up for us, no.

804
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,500
 Sometimes, maybe, but that's not a promise

805
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,060
 that you should bank on, or a promise that God made.

806
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,260
 He tells us, in the context of those verses again,

807
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,500
 the specific good that he's always at work

808
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,620
 bringing about in your life.

809
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,220
 Like, there's a very specific good that he's saying,

810
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,020
 like, man, this is the good that I'm at work

811
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,860
 bringing about in your life.

812
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,140
 Here's what he says in chapter eight, verse 28 and 29.

813
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,380
 And we know that in all things, God works for the good

814
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,900
 of those who love him, who've been called according

815
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,380
 to his purpose.

816
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,860
 For those that God knew, foreknew, he predestined

817
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,880
 to be conformed, here's the specific good that God

818
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,320
 is at work bringing about in your life.

819
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,660
 To be conformed to the image of his son,

820
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,900
 that he might be the firstborn among many brothers

821
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,100
 and sisters, that the specific good that God is at work,

822
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,940
 what's the good?

823
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,700
 Is that in every situation that you face,

824
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,940
 God is going to bring about the good goal of using it

825
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,900
 to make you more like Jesus.

826
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
 Like, that's the specific good.

827
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,860
 In every situation, he doesn't promise that everything

828
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,060
 you face will be good.

829
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,460
 He promises that everything you face, even the bad things,

830
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,340
 even the worst and most painful things, I will use

831
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,020
 to conform your character to be more like Jesus.

832
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,080
 That everything that you walk through, every breakup,

833
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,160
 every hardship, all of them, I will use to make you

834
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,320
 more like Jesus, to work on your character,

835
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,400
 to produce fruits of the spirit would be another way

836
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,300
 of saying it, to produce things that are like God.

837
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,040
 I'm gonna use those to begin to work on your anger problem,

838
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,240
 work on your lust problem, to work on gossip,

839
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,240
 to begin anything that's out in your life that does not

840
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,360
 conform to the character of Jesus, that's what ultimately

841
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,680
 he's bringing about, that he wants to bring about love,

842
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,060
 joy, peace, peace and peace, patience, kindness,

843
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,340
 gentleness, self-control.

844
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,060
 He's gonna use all of the circumstances, even the hardest

845
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,420
 things to bring about making you more and more like Jesus.

846
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,240
 He's not promising everything that you face in this life.

847
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,260
 John 16 is where Jesus looked at his disciples, ironically,

848
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,460
 and he said, here's what I need you to know.

849
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,720
 You're gonna have a really hard life.

850
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,500
 It's gonna be rough.

851
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,800
 And in this world, I'm promising you, you're gonna face

852
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,660
 trouble, but I have overcome the world.

853
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,520
 And this world is a vapor and it is fleeting,

854
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,240
 and I'm enough to get you through it.

855
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,540
 And this is not your home.

856
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,600
 But I will be enough as you walk through that,

857
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,360
 and I will use even the hardest things you face to make you

858
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,400
 more like my son, or to make you more conformed to the

859
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,520
 character of Jesus in your life.

860
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,440
 It's not dissimilar to this.

861
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,240
 I don't know if you guys know how gold is refined.

862
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,700
 When you dig gold out of the ground, and it's just kind of

863
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,340
 like rock and minerals, and you take all that stuff,

864
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,460
 and you're like, this is gold.

865
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,580
 They would take it to a goldsmith, and the goldsmith would

866
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,860
 then take it to a furnace, and here's how he purifies

867
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,700
 the gold.

868
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,420
 He puts it in the furnace, he heats it all the way up,

869
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,140
 and through that heat, all of a sudden, the impurities,

870
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,940
 or the different minerals, begin to rise to the top.

871
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,660
 So he puts it in the oven, heats it all the way up,

872
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
 really, really hot, impurities rise to the top,

873
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,380
 he pulls it out, he scrapes off the impurities of the gold,

874
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,200
 he puts it back in, heats it all the way back up again,

875
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,560
 pulls it back out, scrapes off the impurities of the gold,

876
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,160
 and he does this over and over and over again.

877
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,580
 Every time, the fire helps draw out the impurities,

878
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,200
 and he scrapes them away, puts it back in.

879
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
 Do you know how he knows whenever the gold is pure,

880
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,120
 and purified?

881
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,040
 When he can see his reflection in the gold.

882
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,520
 This is what the Bible says that God is doing,

883
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,200
 even in the hardest circumstances of his life,

884
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,880
 that he's allowing those things to purge out impurities.

885
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,280
 That's what he wants to do.

886
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,340
 He wants to begin to bring out the impurities in your life

887
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,580
 that are not minerals, they're things like anger,

888
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,020
 and lust, jealousy, selfishness, greed.

889
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,060
 That he wants to conform everything in your life,

890
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,620
 the more that you surrender and allow him,

891
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,020
 that's the goal that he's taking you to,

892
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,320
 to be more like Jesus.

893
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,060
 That's what he's trying to do inside of your life,

894
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
 and he's allowing everything,

895
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,420
 even the hardest of circumstances,

896
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,740
 to be like a fire that pushes out,

897
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,300
 and exposes some of the impurities that are there.

898
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,320
 Some of the ways, and I don't trust you, God,

899
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,660
 so that he would bring about,

900
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,340
 to bring you closer to a place

901
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,740
 where you can more clearly see his reflection in your life.

902
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,680
 This is what God is doing.

903
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,360
 This is the specific good that he's promised,

904
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,040
 not upgrades all the time, that your car got wrecked,

905
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,820
 'cause that's 'cause God has a better car for you.

906
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,200
 That's not in the Bible.

907
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,840
 But your car got wrecked, and God has promised,

908
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,000
 I'm gonna use that to make you more like Jesus.

909
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,400
 I wish it was in the Bible, dude.

910
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,240
 That would be amazing.

911
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,160
 It's like, your car got wrecked, but let me tell ya,

912
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,000
 we got a car for you, and you, and you.

913
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,740
 I got a cattle on a thousand hills.

914
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,400
 We got cars, we're not Oprah.

915
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,120
 (congregation laughing)

916
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,880
 And God doesn't say he works like that,

917
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,740
 but he has something so much better,

918
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,600
 so much more lasting than a car, which is your character.

919
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,160
 Ultimately, so many of these positive vibes

920
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,200
 that are about to be done,

921
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,800
 have at the epicenter of them,

922
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:27,400
 they focus on me, and on you,

923
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,520
 on your desires, on your life, on your goals,

924
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,840
 on the things that you want,

925
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,400
 and then also on your ability to pull yourself up

926
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,200
 by your bootstraps, and you just believe enough,

927
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
 and you go take it, and you've got everything you take,

928
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,600
 and you're gonna slay your own Goliath,

929
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,960
 and it puts at the epicenter you,

930
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,680
 the focus of your life, you.

931
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,160
 And the Bible says it doesn't work that way,

932
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,520
 and the more that you just say, man,

933
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,920
 I'm gonna be able to face these hardships in life

934
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,640
 because of me, you've brought a lie.

935
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,160
 The Bible teaches that life almost works like this.

936
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,600
 These are two almost identical balloons.

937
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,360
 The difference between the two

938
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,400
 is that this one has helium in it,

939
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
 and this one does not.

940
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,600
 It has air inside of it.

941
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,880
 You know what happens whenever you hit this balloon down?

942
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
 It comes back up.

943
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,360
 You know what happens when you hit this one down?

944
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,760
 It's already down.

945
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,800
 (congregation laughing)

946
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
 It stays down.

947
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,220
 It's a very simple science experiment.

948
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,000
 But the point is, what is inside of it

949
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,860
 determines its ability to rise.

950
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,120
 The Bible doesn't say that you're never gonna face

951
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,000
 hardship, and you're not gonna go through painful times

952
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,360
 in a breakup and lose your job,

953
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,480
 and not have your car get wrecked,

954
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
 and not be able to make rent,

955
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,860
 and not have things work the way that you want them to work.

956
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,040
 But it does promise that if you allow Christ inside of you

957
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,920
 to lead your life, if you're surrendered to him,

958
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,440
 and you walk with him, and you walk in dependence on him,

959
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,000
 not your own strength and not your ability

960
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,120
 to overcome things, but you walk in dependence on him,

961
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,920
 then no matter how much life throws at you,

962
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,180
 and how much challenges and hardships that you face,

963
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,000
 you will continue to rise.

964
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,120
 I'm not saying succeed and get the promotion every time.

965
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,160
 You won't get the promotion,

966
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,360
 and you're not gonna be held down about it.

967
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,800
 You're gonna be like, "Paul, dude, I'm in prison,

968
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,160
 "but I know the secret of being in prison, or the palace.

969
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,860
 "It's all good, I got Jesus."

970
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,220
 That's what it paints the picture of.

971
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,800
 The flip side is also the same,

972
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,660
 where you're like, "Hey, if you just depend on yourself,

973
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,520
 "your life is about you and building your kingdom,

974
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
 "and your health, and your wealth, and your prosperity,

975
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,360
 "then you're gonna live a life

976
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,280
 "that is depressing, despairing,

977
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,640
 "and you're gonna find yourself whenever you're like,

978
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,720
 "You know what, I've got what it takes

979
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,820
 "to defeat this depression.

980
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,720
 "I've got what it takes to defeat this here."

981
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,840
 You're just gonna end up staying on the ground.

982
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,280
 And you won't rise.

983
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,760
 And this is why people tragically,

984
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,160
 so some of you guys, you're back in church

985
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,080
 for the first time in a while,

986
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,400
 and you were raised in environments

987
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,760
 where they yelled and screamed things,

988
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,680
 and it was inspirational, it didn't make a lot of sense,

989
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,820
 but it inspired you, and you left the church,

990
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,600
 because you were like, "This doesn't even work.

991
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,040
 "It's so awesome when I'm in there, and it's good vibes,

992
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,040
 "but then I leave, and it doesn't lead to a good life.

993
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,960
 "It leads me to be like, something's off.

994
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,100
 "This doesn't really work for me.

995
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,600
 "I thought it was supposed to all be

996
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,080
 "kind of up and to the right, and this is really hard.

997
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,120
 "And my mom died.

998
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,960
 "And I thought, God, you were never gonna leave me

999
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,920
 "and forsake me, and this doesn't seem right."

1000
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,200
 And you walked away from the church.

1001
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,960
 Some of you have family members, like me.

1002
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,600
 I have family members who walked away from the church

1003
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,200
 because they saw these weird, distorted perceptions

1004
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,320
 or expressions of Christianity that are not biblical,

1005
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,980
 and they're the Christian good vibes only variation.

1006
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,280
 Our heart cry, like the, I'll close here.

1007
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,400
 I think the reason this is so popular

1008
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,120
 is because there's something in all of us,

1009
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,360
 inside of my heart, that just,

1010
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,140
 the reason why it's so intriguing and appealing

1011
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,560
 to be like, "Dude, just tell me.

1012
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,260
 "I've got what it takes, and it's gonna be okay,

1013
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,900
 "and it's not gonna win against me,

1014
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,300
 "and I've got it, and God will give me victory,"

1015
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,080
 is because we all just want to know it's gonna be okay.

1016
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,720
 Like, we want someone to just tell us,

1017
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,420
 like, "Just tell me.

1018
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,820
 "Tell me it's gonna be okay.

1019
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,240
 "Tell me it's not gonna end like this.

1020
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,440
 "Tell me the pain is not gonna be

1021
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
 "what I'm feeling right now.

1022
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,020
 "Like, tell me, even though it's hurting right now,

1023
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,480
 "tell me it's gonna be okay."

1024
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,400
 And so we listen to people, and they're like,

1025
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,640
 they give us that message, but it's built on false hope.

1026
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,300
 (gentle music)

1027
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,460
 Well, at the same time,

1028
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,180
 the Bible does say it's gonna be okay.

1029
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,680
 You're gonna be okay.

1030
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,300
 If you're a follower of Jesus,

1031
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,920
 if you are a believer in Jesus Christ,

1032
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,980
 you're gonna be okay.

1033
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,420
 It may not be okay like you want it to be in this life,

1034
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,660
 but it says it's like a vapor,

1035
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,580
 and then for all of eternity with Jesus,

1036
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,780
 it's gonna be okay.

1037
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,140
 He's gonna bring every disease, sickness, cancer to an end.

1038
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,080
 Healing will happen in the next life,

1039
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,040
 and sometimes in this one, but he's promised,

1040
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,160
 it's gonna be okay.

1041
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,900
 It may not be on the timeline that you want,

1042
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,700
 but I need you to listen to me very closely,

1043
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,080
 and what will seem like an instant,

1044
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,920
 that's what a vapor is,

1045
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,800
 that's what the Bible says this life is.

1046
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,260
 You're gonna be in heaven.

1047
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,600
 You're gonna be in eternity with God.

1048
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,160
 It's gonna be okay.

1049
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,280
 It may not all work out like you want it to now

1050
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,500
 in this life, but it's gonna be okay.

1051
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,840
 And the God who's there has gone to such great lengths

1052
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,040
 to make sure that you know that despite the fact

1053
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,520
 that in this life, you're gonna experience bad vibes.

1054
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,440
 I wish I could give everybody just an encouragement,

1055
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,100
 you're gonna leave here and you just got good vibes.

1056
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,000
 You're gonna have bad vibes.

1057
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,840
 You're gonna have bad days.

1058
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,280
 You're gonna have bad things happen to you.

1059
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,720
 You're gonna make bad decisions.

1060
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,900
 You're gonna be responsible for making bad vibes

1061
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,960
 a part of someone else's life.

1062
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,080
 You're gonna do things that hurt your own self,

1063
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,300
 and people are gonna do things that hurt you,

1064
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,300
 and that's just, you can't promise just protection

1065
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,600
 from all the pain, but the God who's there

1066
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,480
 has gone to the greatest extent to show you

1067
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,600
 I will give even my life to promise a future

1068
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,600
 that has a hope and a purpose and is free of all pain.

1069
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,480
 And I did so by dying in your place on the cross.

1070
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,480
 Dying not just for every bad vibe this world

1071
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,280
 has ever experienced, but for every bad decision

1072
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,160
 you've ever made, ever made.

1073
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,960
 Every look at pornography, every time that you've ever

1074
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,940
 committed sexual sin with someone who's not your spouse,

1075
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,760
 every time that every abortion represented in this room,

1076
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,840
 every time that you've worshiped something other than God,

1077
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,200
 including yourself, every time that you've given yourself

1078
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,640
 over to substances just to numb yourself,

1079
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,940
 all of it was paid for.

1080
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,520
 That Jesus went to the cross in an ironic turn of events,

1081
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,320
 in the worst moment in human history, where this happened.

1082
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,080
 Where Jesus went, and he went in a way that would,

1083
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,560
 no one would have said at that moment,

1084
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,000
 I mean, it's good vibes only.

1085
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,480
 But ironically, the worst moment in history,

1086
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,920
 even that moment, God flipped on its head.

1087
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,820
 And today we call it Good Friday.

1088
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,980
 It's the day God died.

1089
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,520
 The day God died for you, the day God died for me,

1090
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,560
 and the day that every bad vibe in our world

1091
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,280
 went on an expiration shot clock.

1092
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,800
 Because the truth and the new world is coming,

1093
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,640
 and Jesus is returning, and with him only come good things.

1094
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,080
 But you need to know, it is only those who have accepted

1095
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,040
 the free gift of God who will have eternal life.

1096
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,280
 It's not those who have a healthy, wealthy life

1097
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,080
 in this time, it's not those who are positive enough,

1098
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,680
 who overcome their challenges enough,

1099
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,140
 it is those who say, I surrender to you, Jesus,

1100
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,580
 you're my savior, I put my faith in what you did

1101
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,760
 on the cross for me.

1102
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,080
 I'm not gonna have a relationship with God

1103
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,220
 because I did anything good.

1104
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,400
 I know I'm not good, and so I'm trusting

1105
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,680
 in what you did for me.

1106
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,520
 You paid on that cross for me, and you rose from the grave,

1107
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,440
 you showed the payment clear, that's what it means

1108
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,840
 to be a Christian, and the only people who will live

1109
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,720
 in the life to come, the only people who should leave here

1110
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,640
 with any hope, that no matter how bad today was,

1111
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,000
 the new world is coming, are those who are not good people,

1112
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,940
 they're forgiven people, who've trusted Jesus,

1113
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,080
 and have put their faith not in how good they've done

1114
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,200
 or how bad they are, there's so many of you,

1115
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,200
 it breaks my heart, every week, you still think

1116
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,780
 you're good enough to go to heaven.

1117
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,300
 Or honestly, the opposite is generally more true,

1118
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,560
 you still think you're too bad to, you still think

1119
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,560
 that no, God, I've really gotta clean stuff up,

1120
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,680
 and I'm trying to get things together,

1121
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,800
 and I'm working on, I need to make some changes,

1122
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,360
 and I'm gonna get back, that will never get you

1123
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,840
 into a relationship with God.

1124
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,560
 You can get all the good things in the world,

1125
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,080
 and you can go a week without smoking pot,

1126
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,360
 and you can go a week without looking at porn,

1127
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,240
 you can go a week without texting her late at night,

1128
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,080
 none of that will get you deserving

1129
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,120
 to have a relationship with God.

1130
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,460
 Wherever you're at right now, he's inviting you

1131
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,560
 to know him, to have a relationship with him,

1132
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,660
 he already paid for it.

1133
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,040
 When he on the cross took all of your sin,

1134
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,560
 past, present, and future, he knows everything,

1135
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,740
 every sin you haven't even committed yet, he paid for it.

1136
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,580
 Think about that.

1137
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,640
 Everything you're gonna do in a year from now, paid.

1138
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,600
 That's how scandalous the gospel and the grace of God is.

1139
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,420
 He's inviting all of us to have eternal life

1140
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,640
 and a relationship that experiences an abundant life,

1141
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,640
 not monetarily, but in abundance by walking with him now,

1142
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,800
 by receiving the free gift, God, I'm a sinner,

1143
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,040
 I trust in what you did on the cross,

1144
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,840
 and dying for my sin, and rising from the grave,

1145
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,640
 and I receive that free gift, I don't deserve it,

1146
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,000
 but I receive it right now.

1147
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,960
 I believe that, God, I believe you paid for me.

1148
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,080
 You're who you say you are.

1149
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,920
 Let me pray.

1150
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,080
 Father, thank you that you are a God

1151
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,720
 who's gone to such great lengths.

1152
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,860
 (congregation laughing)

1153
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,060
 To restore a world that is full of bad brokenness

1154
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,060
 and bad vibes to perfect, good, loving, whole,

1155
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:48,180
 not just vibes, but reality.

1156
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,280
 Thank you that already you are working backwards

1157
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,060
 the curse that sin broke, or the curse that sin

1158
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,260
 brought into the world when it broke everything,

1159
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,280
 and you're beginning healing, and it's not always healing

1160
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,820
 like walking again, or someone's body being restored

1161
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,940
 in this life, but you are working backwards in our world,

1162
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,140
 and you are bringing your kingdom,

1163
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,100
 and you're returning someday.

1164
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,580
 I pray right now, God, for anyone in this room

1165
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,160
 who has been burned by the prosperity gospel,

1166
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,620
 they've been burned by expressions of Christianity

1167
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,420
 that do not resemble what the Bible says,

1168
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,820
 that you would move near to their heart now.

1169
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,300
 You would work and begin to just heal wounds,

1170
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,780
 and baggage, and things that happen

1171
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,300
 by people standing on stages like me right now,

1172
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,660
 claiming things that you don't ever say

1173
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,500
 they should have claimed in your name.

1174
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,360
 For abuse that's taken place, God, would you heal?

1175
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,700
 Father, thank you that you love us, and you're for us.

1176
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,840
 You have a plan, and in all of eternity,

1177
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,240
 we'll get to experience the goodness of our God.

1178
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,380
 But as we wait, we experience that still,

1179
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,780
 and trust you, and walk with you,

1180
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,780
 and hold onto you in the midst of hardship, God.

1181
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,660
 Help us to be those type of people, amen.
