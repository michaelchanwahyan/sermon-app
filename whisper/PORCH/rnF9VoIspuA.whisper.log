[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.560]   All right, what's up everybody in the room?
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.120]   Everybody tuning in wherever you're coming in from.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.920]   Porch Live locations, Porch Boise, Porch Indy,
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.320]   Porch Scottsdale, Tulsa, North Houston,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.120]   Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wherever you are listening,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.200]   Des Moines, wherever you are tuning in from,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.840]   we are continuing this series on Ephesians
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   and looking at this book written by the Apostle Paul
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.440]   that lays out the Christian life and the new you.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.420]   When I was in college at Texas A&M,
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.200]   which is apparently where everyone else
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.040]   was in college in here,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.560]   I had a chance to do track and field there.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   And while I was there, I just was introduced to this team
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.760]   that I would be a part of, and I like threw the javelin,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120]   which is the least impressive of any sport that exists.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.800]   It's like you're throwing a spear and nobody does it,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.880]   so there's no competition,
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.120]   so let's just get that out of the way.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.160]   But point being, you would have your entire world
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.920]   was around this team.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.700]   So where you would eat would be with all the other teammates
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.080]   that you would have and where you would sleep
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.280]   and the dorms that they would put you in
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.080]   would be with all the other track teammates
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   that were a part of your team.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.600]   And it was a really interesting group
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.400]   because if you have seen a track and field team,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.680]   you know that because of the different events
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.280]   that are involved,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.800]   that you have a really diverse group of people.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.880]   Like you have a guy who is like 100 pounds soaking wet
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.480]   who runs the mile and he can just run with incredible speed
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.660]   and then he would be sitting at the dinner table
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.400]   when we'd all be eating next to a 300 pound shot put thrower
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.060]   that looked like he'd eaten three of those guys.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.300]   And then you would have this guy,
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.180]   I mean, there was a guy,
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.220]   most athletic person I've ever met in my life.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.060]   His name was Tyler.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.540]   He was a shot put thrower.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.180]   The guys, this will mean something to you.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.700]   Girls, you probably won't care.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.420]   He ran a four, five and a 40.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.460]   He was six foot seven, 280 pounds.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.700]   He was recruited by the US bobsled team
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.260]   because he was so heavy and so fast.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.380]   It was just unbelievable.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.560]   And then you had next to him was this five eight,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.760]   a guy named Fabrice.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.640]   How cool is that name?
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.580]   Fabrice.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580]   And he was a long jumper that was like 110 pounds,
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.380]   but he could just fly and ended up going to the Olympics
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.880]   for doing long jump.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.780]   And you just had this group of people,
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.760]   each with very different gifts
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520]   and everybody stayed in their lane.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.760]   In other words, the 300 pound shot put thrower
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.600]   was not like, you know what?
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.720]   I think I'm gonna go for the mile today.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.680]   Let's give that a shot.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.400]   He knew I'm here to throw a big metal rock
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.240]   as far as possible.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.080]   And then the guy who was running the mile
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.360]   knew that his role was not to try to jump over something
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.320]   or throw something.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.840]   It was to run the mile.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.920]   And the only way that our team would be successful
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.740]   is by working together and by each playing our part
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.480]   based on the gifting and ability
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.120]   that we brought to the table.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.680]   Now, what does that have to do with the book of Ephesians?
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.880]   Well, tonight we're gonna look at a passage
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.000]   in Ephesians chapter four,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.320]   where the apostle Paul is gonna say,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.640]   if you want to experience and maximize
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.440]   all that God wants to do through your life,
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.980]   it's gonna involve you working
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.640]   and being a part of something with others,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.040]   just like a team requires teammates working together.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.020]   And it's gonna involve you contributing
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.500]   and playing your specific part.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.960]   Just like a team in track has to work together
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.680]   in order to be successful and each play their role
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   and each work together, so it is with the body of Christ.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   And what Paul's gonna lay out in these three ideas,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.840]   we're gonna look at Ephesians chapter four,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.640]   is really the recipe for how people grow in their faith.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.200]   In other words, if you have been growing
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.120]   and experiencing spiritual growth in your life,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.320]   it's directly a result
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.800]   of what Paul's gonna talk about here.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.500]   And the flip side is also true.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.840]   If you have been, maybe you trusted Christ at an early age
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.440]   and you've been around, but let's be honest,
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   you've grown in years, but you haven't grown in your faith.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.100]   And it's because of not applying
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.800]   and doing what Paul is gonna write
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.140]   to the church in Ephesus.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.140]   This simple truth is one that has the potential
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.720]   to change the course and trajectory of your life.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.360]   It has the potential and will, not just have the potential,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.180]   it will shape the future you're gonna have,
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.520]   because it involves you being connected together
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.320]   and just like a track athlete working with a team,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.640]   the body of Christ is to be in relationship with one another
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   and in particular ways in order
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.840]   to be everything that God wants for you
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.520]   and everything that God wants to do through your life.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.280]   And so we're gonna look in Ephesians chapter four,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.560]   verse one through 16.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.880]   I'm gonna start, I'm gonna read through it.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.120]   If you've just joined us,
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.620]   we've been walking through the church
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.360]   of this letter to the church in Ephesus.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.280]   Ephesus was a port city in modern day Turkey.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.100]   You could go there today, it's beautiful,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   it has the climate of LA, it was a very wealthy city.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.900]   It had incredible blue water right in front of it.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.100]   It was a place where people wanted to live,
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.100]   incredibly influential city, and Paul loved this city.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.500]   And so he spent as much time in that city
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.700]   as almost any other church that he worked with.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.220]   And he's sitting in a prison cell around 60 AD,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.460]   and he writes this letter to the church in Ephesus.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.840]   And the first three chapters is just Paul going off
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.800]   about all that you have in Christ.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.120]   In other words, he doesn't get to any,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.780]   and here's what you do for the first three chapters.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.240]   He's just going, "Before the foundation of the world,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.360]   "God had the gospel and you in mind.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.940]   "And in Christ, when you trusted Jesus
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.880]   "as the Lord and Savior of your life,"
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.720]   what does that mean?
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.380]   When you trusted Jesus, you on the cross,
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.360]   you paid for all of my sin, past, present, future.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.640]   And you came back alive, showing that payment was enough.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.880]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.120]   When that happened, and he just goes off
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.000]   for three beautiful, amazing chapters
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.400]   about all that God has done.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.280]   And then in chapter four, he takes a turn
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.160]   and begins to go, "So in light of that,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.400]   "here is now how you live out the Christian life."
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.680]   And he brings up the idea of walking.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.600]   So the first three chapters are all about
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.800]   the wealth you have in Christ.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.360]   The next two are about the walk we now live out in Christ.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.040]   And we're gonna look at that tonight.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.440]   And I'm gonna start in verse one of chapter four.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord,
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.420]   "therefore in light of all that God has done for you,
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.740]   "in light of you being sealed for all of eternity,
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.740]   "you are a new creation, urge you to walk in a manner
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.040]   "worthy of the calling to which you have been called."
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.580]   He sets up a big statement, says,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.780]   "In light of all that God has done for you."
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.900]   "I am urging you to walk in a manner worthy
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.720]   "of the calling you've received."
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.600]   The new life that you have.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.380]   The Greek word worthy that he uses is a Greek word
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.800]   that would be used oftentimes for a weight on a scale.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   He's saying, "You should live in a way that proportionally
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.740]   "is equal to the amazing things,
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.100]   "the new life that you have been given in Christ.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.780]   "And I'm urging you to live in light of,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.800]   "or consistent with the amazing life
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.640]   "that you have in Christ."
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.840]   In other words, if your Christian life looks like this,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.200]   God has done all these amazing things,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.640]   but it has no impact on your life,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.200]   he's saying, "You're not living in proportion
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.040]   "to what God has done."
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.920]   He's saying, "People should look at your life,"
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.260]   in other words, and they see that, man, they're different.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.000]   And if they find out, it's 'cause they're a Christian,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.080]   they would go, "Oh, well that makes sense."
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.840]   That in other words, if people look at your life
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.300]   and they go, "Wait, they're a Christian?
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.480]   "They don't look any different than anybody else."
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.160]   And Paul's saying, "Hey, you and I,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.820]   "and this new life in Christ,
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.820]   "are to live in proportion and consistent with the new you."
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.880]   And then he lists out what that looks like.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.200]   And where he goes is interesting,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.960]   because you would think, what's he gonna say?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.620]   Hey, live with the new you.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.000]   Memorize the whole New Testament.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.240]   Spend hours each day in prayer.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.440]   Pick up everything and move to a foreign country
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.220]   and be a missionary.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.320]   None of those are bad things, but it's not where he goes.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.600]   He then turns to you all together,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.100]   and he says this in verse two.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.600]   Here's how to live consistent and worthy
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.400]   with the calling you have in Christ.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.960]   Live with humility and gentleness,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.960]   with patience, bearing with one another in love,
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.600]   eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.120]   in the bond of peace.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.520]   That Paul sets up this big statement,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.040]   "And I, in light of three chapters
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.780]   "and all that God has done and the amazing work
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.160]   "on the cross that has been accomplished,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.960]   "I am urging you to live in light of all of that."
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.200]   And then he brings up by getting along.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.080]   I mean, it's this big statement followed by,
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.240]   "I want you to bear with one another."
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.760]   And it literally is a translation
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400]   for to get along with one another,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.120]   to put up with each other.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.440]   And why would that be so important?
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.280]   Because Paul knew that his day was much like our day,
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   that often Christians and humanity in general
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.320]   is not known for getting along and for being united
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.480]   and for being for one another, and we can disagree,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.560]   but I still love you.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.320]   That we live in a world that, man, if you cross me,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.960]   then we're done, or this is over,
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.720]   or you hurt me, and I'm out.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.640]   And he's saying, "I want you to be diligent
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.280]   "to fight for unity of the Spirit."
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.720]   And then he brings up all the different ways
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.680]   that you and I are to be one, just as God is one.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.600]   He says, "There's one body and one Spirit,
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.840]   "is in the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.740]   "You were called to one hope that belongs to your call.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.140]   "There's one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.700]   "one God and Father of all, who's over all
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.600]   "and through all and in all."
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.120]   He's saying, "I am urging you to fight for unity."
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.800]   The first idea Paul brings up is if you wanna follow Jesus,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.200]   if you wanna be all that God wants you to be,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   it involves you and other believers in your life together,
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.040]   and specifically fighting for unity together.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.600]   And when somebody hurts you, you don't run from it,
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.220]   you bear with them and you seek to forgive them,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.600]   and you seek to fight to move towards one another,
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   just like God and Christ, despite our sin against Him,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.720]   move towards us.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.860]   And now as Christians, Paul says,
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.080]   "Hey, you and I are to move towards one another."
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.080]   And he uses the word be diligent, as in work hard at it.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.600]   It should be a constant thing
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.900]   that you and your relationships, and me and my relationships,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.760]   how do you know if you're experiencing the will of God?
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.600]   You ready?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.820]   Here's one of the ways.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.980]   How do you know if you're living in line
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.200]   with the Spirit of God?
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.000]   If you're a Christian, you have the Spirit of God.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.240]   How do you know if you're living in line with it?
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.640]   The Spirit of God is always moving towards unity.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.080]   If you are moving away from unity and towards division,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.240]   you're living in light of a spirit,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.840]   but it's not the Spirit of God.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.560]   He says that, "As believers, I am calling you now
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.160]   "to fight for unity and to be diligent,"
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.580]   as in it's gonna take work.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.520]   You know what the reality,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.920]   we talk about community groups here all the time,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.720]   how you gotta get connected
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.180]   and you gotta have other believers in your life.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.440]   If you haven't taken that step,
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.120]   let me remove a mystery for you.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.400]   The day that you take that step,
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.640]   you're gonna step more towards what God's designed
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.020]   for relationships and transformation,
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.280]   but you're also gonna take a step, you ready?
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.220]   For headaches and frustrations
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.800]   and things that rub you the wrong way
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.880]   or don't always go perfectly how you would.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.720]   You know why?
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.600]   Because you're moving in the direction of other people.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.040]   And you know what people have in common?
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.900]   They're all messed up, just like you.
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.000]   And so the reason, I don't know,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.400]   a community group at Watermark,
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.440]   and I've been one eight years, amazing,
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.720]   and there's times where you're just gonna have conflict
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.680]   and Paul's saying, "Hey, you have got to fight."
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.680]   There's no varsity level you reach as a Christian
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.600]   where, hey, you no longer have to fight to be unified.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600]   It just comes easy.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.600]   That doesn't happen.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.720]   And Paul says, "For the rest of your life,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   "you're gonna have to fight to be united."
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.560]   Fight for unity.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.200]   It's like this, every summer,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.880]   the same thing happens in my front lawn.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.660]   Weeds will grow up and I'll have to go out there
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.160]   and I'll have to pick them out.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.600]   And then the next summer will come.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.060]   And you know what happens again?
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.040]   Weeds will come up in my lawn.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.800]   You know what didn't happen in between those two occasions
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.200]   where I removed them and the next summer came
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.760]   and they were back again?
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.180]   I didn't go out in my front yard
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.800]   and get a bunch of weed seed and be like,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.260]   "Here, put some over here and put some over here."
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.120]   They just popped up because it's a byproduct
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.600]   of having a lawn.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.560]   It comes with the territory.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.820]   And a byproduct of working with people
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.160]   is that there's gonna be conflicts and offenses and hurts.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.040]   And as believers, we're not naive,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.280]   pretending that doesn't happen.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.600]   We fight for unity because we know it will happen.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.140]   It comes with the territory.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.880]   And candidly, let me just bring you into my world.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.040]   This is something that, like,
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:27.920]   when I say it never goes away,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.200]   I mean it never goes away for myself very much included.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.760]   I mean, I had to move different meetings today
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.960]   because of hurts that I had caused with somebody on my team
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.840]   that was not intentional but was still a miss
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.920]   completely for me.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.040]   Had to move into conversations
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.480]   where I negatively interpreted something
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.120]   and had to say, "Man, hey, here's the things
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.160]   "that I am thinking about that situation."
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.140]   It doesn't go away.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.620]   And I can either choose to sit on that,
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.040]   pretend it, stuff it, act like everything's fine,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.240]   or I can piece fake,
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   or I can piece make by running towards that situation.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.120]   And that looks like me asking for forgiveness
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.000]   for ways that I've offended, not just today, anytime.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And vice versa, and fighting for unity, not uniformity.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.200]   You can disagree, like we can debate as Christians,
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.120]   but we are not to be divided.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   I mean, this is a message that especially right now
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.460]   with elections, just the craziness of the world
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.100]   that we as Christians are called,
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.660]   as much as anything else, anybody else,
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.500]   we don't cancel people.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.420]   We fight for people 'cause we fight for unity.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.140]   And how do you know if you're living in God's will
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.460]   if you are living in relationship with other people
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.440]   where you are fighting for unity,
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.000]   not to be right, not to win, but to be united?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.540]   And Paul says, if you wanna experience
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.060]   what God's design and purpose and call for your life,
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.580]   it's gonna involve you living in that way together.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.180]   Later in the same chapter, he says this,
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.060]   "In your anger, do not let the sun go down
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.860]   "while you are still angry."
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:07.680]   The rest of the verse says,
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.740]   "Do not give the devil a foothold inside of your life."
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.500]   That you and I are to fight to keep short accounts.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.180]   The point of the verse is not, hey, if you're angry
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.700]   and you go to bed, you're insane, he's saying,
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.700]   no, you should move quickly when somebody's hurt you
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.580]   towards that person,
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.940]   especially if they're a brother and sister in Christ.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.220]   We did an entire message on this
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.280]   in anti-suppressants a couple months ago,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.300]   so I'm not gonna go at length here,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.700]   but the scriptures give us a real clear path
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.820]   to fight for unity.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.820]   The Matthew 18 passage that Jesus teaches on forgiving
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.980]   gives the clearest instruction, which says,
[00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.780]   hey, if your brother sins against you,
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.420]   you go to him in private.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.700]   So they sin, they hurt you, they do something,
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.420]   you go to them in private.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.260]   If they don't listen,
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.240]   then you go to them with someone else.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.580]   If they still don't listen,
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.820]   then you widen the circle only as is necessary,
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.380]   not for the purpose of shaming them or paying them back,
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.380]   but moving them back into relationship,
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.140]   to being reconciled with other believers.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.780]   That we only talk to people who are a part of the problem
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.940]   or a part of the solution.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.740]   In other words, man, if somebody in your life
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.020]   has frustrated you, you are not fighting for unity
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.420]   if you just put them on blast on social media.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.260]   If somebody in your life has offended you,
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.620]   maybe this is a more common way,
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:26.980]   you're not fighting for unity
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.380]   if when you go to your community group,
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.020]   your small group or your church group,
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.620]   and underneath the banner of prayer requests,
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.820]   you talk gossip, which is incredibly common
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.340]   of going, hey guys, yeah, hard week.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.780]   I think we should all pray for Stephanie.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.700]   I mean, clearly there's something wrong with her.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.140]   She's back with that guy and we could really use prayer.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.140]   Or Kyle, I mean, we should pray for him.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.380]   His heart, did you see the car?
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.000]   I think he's leasing that car.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.260]   Clearly materialistic.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.260]   We need to just cover him in prayer.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.100]   It's gossip.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.540]   And it's not fighting for unity.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.700]   And the scripture commands that it's not an option.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.940]   If there is someone in your life right now
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.700]   that has hurt you, that is a believer, listen to me.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.620]   You are commanded to move towards that person,
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.860]   to fight for unity with them.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.580]   If they've hurt you, maybe if you just feel like,
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.540]   man, they're just off and you guys just got beef,
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.940]   like, can't believe some of y'all come down front,
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.780]   and I can like sense the tension between you
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.380]   and it's like, there's something wrong with y'all.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.500]   Like, have y'all ever talked about this?
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.140]   And you're like, yeah, well,
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.380]   can we talk in private for a second?
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.360]   And then they bring it up and there's all these hurts
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.960]   that they may even be willing to share just with me,
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.520]   but they haven't shared with that person
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.620]   and that's not consistent with the faith that you have.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.860]   So Paul says, hey, if you wanna live out your calling,
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.620]   it involves living with other people in relationship
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.020]   and moving towards that person.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.300]   Jesus is, one of the last prayers he prayed was,
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.180]   "Father, I pray for the unity among your people.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.080]   "I pray that they would be united
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.060]   "and there is an enemy who hates this."
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.900]   He wants to do everything he can right now
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.780]   to tell you why you are justified in your hurt
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:04.940]   and it's their fault.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.620]   They need to be the one who's moving towards you,
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.460]   not you towards them.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.400]   You've already done enough, they've hurt you.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.880]   He wants you to stay there.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.720]   You know that, right?
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.000]   So when you hear that voice going off,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.600]   or you hear it's not that big of a deal,
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.360]   or man, I'm just gonna turn to the other side
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.000]   and you dismiss the ability to step towards unity,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.920]   you are not listening to the spirit of God.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.780]   And there's an enemy, he wants his offense.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.880]   Satan's offense is division.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.660]   He wants to destroy your community groups,
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.960]   your relationships, your family relationships.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.320]   He wants to do everything he can to box you into that hurt
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.740]   and box you into how it's all their problems,
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.400]   rather than saying, "I am going to treat them
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.640]   "not how they treated me,
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.640]   "but how God and Christ treated me,"
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.740]   and move towards them.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.740]   Second thing Paul goes into also involves
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.080]   working together with other people.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   He says, "To each one of us, grace has been given
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.320]   "as Christ apportioned or distributed it."
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   This is why it says, and he quotes a Psalm,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.040]   when Jesus ascended on high,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.240]   he set captives free, or took many captives,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.200]   and he gave gifts to people, that God in Christ,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.500]   when you became a believer, he gave spiritual gifts.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.040]   So Christ gave himself, and he lists out various gifts.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.420]   He gave apostles, those are the ones
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.440]   who wrote the New Testament.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.560]   Then he gave people who spoke prophetically
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.200]   or brought forth truth, evangelists,
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.720]   the gift of evangelism, pastors and teachers
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.640]   to equip his people for the works of service,
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.840]   that God gave out spiritual gifts
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.920]   so that the body of Christ, verse 12,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.320]   "may be built up."
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.160]   Second thing that Paul says,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   if you wanna live out your calling,
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.560]   it's gonna involve using the spiritual gifts
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.600]   God has given you.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.480]   So it involves fighting for unity
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.920]   and fulfilling your gifting,
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.640]   that you are gonna live and serve
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.040]   with the spiritual gifts that God has given you,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.240]   'cause here's the truth.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.020]   The Bible says in 1 Corinthians chapter 12,
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.920]   Romans chapter 12, 1 Peter chapter four,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.500]   Ephesians chapter four, it says,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.320]   "God, when you became a believer,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.960]   "spiritual gifts were given to you."
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.440]   And it lists out, they're all throughout the scriptures.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.680]   You can go to watermark.org, type in spiritual gift tests,
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.000]   and you can take a test that will tell you
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.680]   some of the spiritual gifts that you have.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   In addition to taking one of those tests,
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.420]   you've gotta use that gift.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.780]   And when you do, you begin to see,
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.760]   man, it's like you come alive when you do that.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.160]   Maybe you have the gift of evangelism
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.760]   and just sharing your faith,
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.840]   it just like, you come alive
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.720]   and it just comes easier than other people.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.360]   Maybe you have the gift of teaching,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.440]   and for you, you serve and you lead a small group
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.960]   of high school, junior high students,
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.680]   and it's like something just on the inside,
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680]   it just comes alive,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.960]   where you have the gift of leadership.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.800]   That's another one of the gifts
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.960]   in Romans 12, as mentioned.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.240]   And people around you, and they just affirm,
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.880]   they're like, you've always been a leader.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.920]   You've always have been a leader.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.480]   Or the gift of administration,
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.320]   like details and administering and putting on things.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.240]   It just comes naturally to you
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.960]   in ways that is foreign to so many of us.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.840]   I don't know what it is for you,
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.340]   but I know that when you became a believer,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.580]   God entrusted you with spiritual gifts
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:12.040]   that he gave to build his church.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.180]   Do you know your gifts?
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.840]   Are you using your gifts?
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.200]   At Christmas time, we'll have different family
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.280]   that lives out of state,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.120]   and they'll mail presents for my kids.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.780]   And I'll get a big box that will arrive,
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.920]   and inside of the box will be different presents
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.880]   that are to be opened up Christmas morning for my kids.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.800]   So my six-year-old, he'll get like a Nerf gun,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.280]   or my daughter, some like pony princess,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.240]   and our eight-month-old, he's just happy to be here.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.120]   But they'll get these different gifts,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.880]   and they're given with the intention,
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   not of me keeping them,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   but of giving them to my kids.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.600]   And just like it would be messed up,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.540]   and weird, and you would think I'm a bad father
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.520]   if the gifts that I got given,
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.100]   I didn't actually pass on to them,
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.900]   I just kept them, you know, I really like Nerf guns,
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.980]   and I've always wanted a pony,
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.380]   and so I'm keeping all these for me.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.940]   You go, man, that's really messed up.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.900]   God is saying, I gave you spiritual gifts
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.240]   for the purpose of building up the church,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.700]   not building out your resume,
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.060]   not building your business,
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.940]   not building some future preferred destination
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.300]   of what life will look like someday,
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.500]   none of which are bad things,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.020]   but if they come at the exclusion
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.700]   of you using the spiritual gifts
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.160]   that God said I gave those gifts,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.280]   not for you, but to be passed through you.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.120]   And if you wanna experience your calling,
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.440]   it involves fulfilling your gifting.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.600]   God made you unique.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.780]   You have a unique story, a unique wiring,
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.920]   and unique skill sets that I don't have.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.220]   And he's saying, hey, are you gonna use those
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.700]   to be gifts that I'm giving not to you,
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.880]   but through you, 'cause that's what spiritual gifts are for,
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   for the building up of the church.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.860]   There are so many leaders, candidly,
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.780]   we are spoiled at the porch with the amazing men and women
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.660]   that Josiah and Kendall lead every single week,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.780]   the 200 men and women who put on the porch,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.700]   the porch leaders, that I see this firsthand
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.220]   in the way that they live.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.580]   And the stories, I could go on for hours
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.420]   of just men and women,
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.620]   and you know what they've got a vision for?
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.460]   And it doesn't have to be here.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.700]   It can be in any different arena,
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.020]   in lots of ministries in the city,
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.660]   in lots of places, in lots of opportunities here every week,
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.200]   but it's just men and women who've caught a vision for,
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.000]   I believe the Bible is true.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Jesus is real.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.920]   He's coming back.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.060]   Eternity is long.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.120]   Hell is real.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.000]   And I wanna use my gifts and the way God has made me
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.360]   for the short window called life that I have.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.600]   And they, week after week,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.400]   and they see those gifts just come alive.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.600]   I think of my friend Ryan.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.800]   We do this three-day in-town mission trip
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.040]   called Unashamed.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.160]   And it's birthed out of basically a passion
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.480]   and a gift of evangelism.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.100]   And he said, "Man, I wanna see young adults
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.340]   "learn how to share their faith."
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.780]   And so we started doing these three-day
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.940]   in-town mission trips where we train them
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.280]   on how to go share their faith.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.620]   And then we'd partner with local ministries
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.100]   inside of Dallas where there is desperate need
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.840]   for people to come and just paint houses
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.980]   and mow lawns of widows and care for people
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.780]   in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.680]   And to be a light in a city that is full of darkness,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.440]   just like every city that's tuning in right now
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.420]   is full of darkness.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.820]   And God has you where he does for you to use your gifts
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.740]   and to serve him.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.940]   And frankly, I hope every one of you
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.740]   emails southdallas@watermark.org.
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.800]   If you're listening online, you missed that announcement,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.860]   but there's an opportunity October 30th
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.300]   from one to 7 p.m. for you to use your gifts
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.820]   and just serve and to care for some of the least of these.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.820]   Or you can watch the Cowboys probably lose.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.060]   And I hope they win.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.540]   I got Dak on my fantasy football team,
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.660]   which is not a great thing right now.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.420]   But point is, what are you gonna do?
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.700]   It's a one time a year thing.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.980]   If we don't have that thing filled,
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.500]   Marvin, I'm embarrassed if we don't have that thing filled.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.260]   Out of 3,000 people, we can't fill out 200?
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.660]   And whether it's that weekend or in general,
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.460]   are you using your gifts?
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.140]   'Cause the truth is, part of the spiritual life is,
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.580]   man, if you only breathe in and you never breathe out,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.940]   something happens.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.820]   You die.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.580]   And if you only take in and you come here
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.940]   and you consume every single week,
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.460]   well, you never contribute.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.160]   Your spiritual life is not growing, it's dying.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.700]   There's an old Oklahoma football coach
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.660]   who coached the Sooners,
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.060]   and he was describing what football is.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.940]   And he said, "Football is a game played
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.940]   "by 22 men on the field, desperately in need of rest,
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.920]   "being watched by 50,000 people in the stands,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.160]   "desperately in need of exercise."
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.400]   And there's so few doing so much,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.920]   while so many just watch.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.880]   And what a tragic thing,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.960]   that in the church, that's often the case.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.320]   There are so few doing so much, while so many just watch.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.580]   And the reason it's tragic is not for the so many,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.760]   because the so few need them,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.480]   it's because the so many who are not using their gifts
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.900]   and they show up and they consume,
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.000]   they are missing out
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.580]   on seeing God use their life,
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.140]   on investing in something that actually matters.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.860]   Maybe for you, you consider serving,
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.220]   and you join those 200 volunteers,
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.260]   and we will train you on how to share the gospel,
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.380]   how to engage inside of our city.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.640]   And you sign up and go to the Porch app,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.260]   like our app on the App Store, online, on your phone,
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.820]   use the application, you can go sign up
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.380]   and be a part of that, and go through 10 weeks
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.340]   led by some amazing men and women.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.220]   I don't know where it is, I do know that God has said,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.260]   "You have got to use the gifts He has entrusted to you
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.020]   "if you wanna grow, if you wanna mature.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:55.720]   "And if not, you're not growing.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.040]   "You're not thriving.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   "Your spiritual life is stagnant or dying."
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   Finally, he says, "When we do this,
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.320]   "and we fight for unity together,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.540]   "and then we seek to use the God-given gifts
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.540]   "that He's given you, something begins to happen.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.140]   "Until we all reach unity in the faith
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:27.260]   "and knowledge in the Son of God, and become mature,
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.520]   "attaining the whole measure or the fullness of Christ.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:36.020]   "So then, we will no longer be infants."
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.500]   Hey, when we're fighting for unity relationally together,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.340]   when we're serving and existing connected to a body,
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.060]   when we're serving with our gifts,
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.540]   then we are no longer infants.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.940]   We grow up, we mature.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.540]   We're no longer infants tossed to and fro by the waves,
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.140]   blown here and there with every wind of teaching.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.580]   Instead, speaking the truth in love,
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.660]   we will grow up to become, in every respect, mature.
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.760]   A mature body of Christ.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.180]   Of Him that is the head, that is Christ.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.420]   That Paul says, "Hey, when you begin to do this,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.020]   "maturity begins to happen, and you begin to grow,
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.760]   "and your spiritual life begins to grow.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.420]   "When you're connected with other people."
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.220]   The third idea, I have to walk you through it, man.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.300]   We fight for unity, we fulfill your gifting.
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.360]   If you wanna live out your calling,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.060]   it also involves you forging real community.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.420]   You cannot grow and you will not grow.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.900]   You will not have maturity without community.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.860]   What's community?
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.900]   It's our word to describe authentic relationships.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.400]   So you call it whatever you want to,
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.060]   but a small group, if you're a Christian,
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.020]   of men, if you're a man, of women,
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.500]   if you're a woman who know you,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   they know where you're struggling,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.860]   they come alongside and they pray for you,
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.700]   they support you when you go through hard times,
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.380]   they're financially caring for you,
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.020]   maybe you're in a rough position, and they come alongside,
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.340]   and they are God's provision and protection in your life.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.300]   And if you wanna live out and experience your calling,
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.180]   it involves forging your community,
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.300]   or forging godly community.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.500]   Why do I say forging?
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   'Cause there's a myth that, man,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.020]   if I just could find the right group,
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.100]   then everything would be easy,
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.660]   and the hills are alive with the sound of music,
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.880]   and that's not true.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.960]   Every group is gonna take work in fighting for unity
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.200]   and forming relationships.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.000]   This is why we hammer the importance
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.560]   of being a member of a church,
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.040]   because if you wanna grow, and this is the reason,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.520]   man, some of you guys, you trusted Christ
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.020]   at like a church camp 14 years ago,
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.120]   seven years ago, three years ago.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.160]   You came to faith and grew up in a Christian home,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.440]   and you've grown 10 years older,
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.640]   but your faith has not grown at all.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:49.400]   And the reason is because you have not gotten connected
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.720]   to the body, and the verses we just read said
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   it's in connection to the body that you and I grow, mature.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.900]   This is the reason why your faith has not grown,
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.360]   because you have not got connected
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.540]   and been a part of the body of Christ.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.640]   My son, his name's Bear, he's eight months old,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.380]   and this past week was a big week for him.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.940]   Here he is, hanging out at the house,
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.940]   learned to crawl, and that's one of the pictures of it.
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.000]   And it was a big moment.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.740]   When you're eight month old, begins to crawl,
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.120]   it's honestly kind of got pluses and minuses,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.960]   because prior to that, you could just set him down,
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.960]   and you could go somewhere,
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.600]   and you knew exactly where he was gonna be,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.280]   and now he's mobile.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.440]   And so he is able to move and walk around
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.320]   and swallow things like his sister's little car there,
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.120]   and it just creates a new challenge.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.480]   But when you're eight months old, that's awesome.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.880]   You're learning to crawl.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.180]   How weird and creepy would it be if he was eight years old,
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.580]   and all he did was crawl?
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.020]   I mean, it's a silly illustration, but think about it.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.320]   You show up, you see an eight month old crawling,
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.020]   and you're like, oh, all of you just did it.
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.920]   You were like, aw.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.280]   You see an eight year old crawling,
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.480]   there's something wrong.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.800]   Because you're going, what?
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.200]   You haven't learned to walk?
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.280]   And yet spiritually, that's the case for a lot of people.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.780]   Like you've been a spiritual infant,
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.200]   and I'm not mad at you.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.940]   I have nothing invested in seeing anything,
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.680]   but you experience more of God's love,
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.340]   goodness, protection, freedom.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.880]   But you've been a spiritual infant for 10 years.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:43.280]   You're still a spiritual toddler in diapers.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.920]   And you haven't grown, and the reason why
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.320]   is because you're not connected to other believers.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.000]   You've been church hopping for the last three years,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.800]   and you still think like, oh, we just moved to Dallas.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.520]   You've been church hopping and church dating
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.720]   in different cities around the country
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.720]   underneath the banner of, man, I'm still checking it out,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.360]   and I go here on Sundays, and I go here on Tuesdays.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.080]   And as long as you do that,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.960]   let me tell you what Paul says you're delaying.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.040]   As long as you decide, man, someday I'm not ready,
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.760]   I'm going to, I'm still looking.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.320]   As long as you're still looking, you are still delaying
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.080]   you maturing in your faith.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.880]   'Cause Paul says it is by being connected
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.720]   to other believers, serving and using your gifts,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.640]   that your faith grows and that you personally grow.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.680]   This is why the language of, man, I love Jesus,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.120]   I don't like the church, is so foolish.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.040]   Because one, Jesus would say,
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.520]   the church is the bride of Christ.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:49.120]   I love the church, Jesus would say so much, I died for her.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.640]   And you think about even that idea of,
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.040]   what fiance would be okay with you
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.120]   insulting his bride like that?
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.320]   I mean, that's exactly what you're saying,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.680]   if you're like, hey, I like Jesus,
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.520]   I just don't like the church,
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.800]   that's like going up to a guy and be like,
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.680]   look, bro, I like you, it's your girl,
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.840]   got a big problem with her.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.280]   It'd be like, what, who's okay with that?
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.320]   Who's like, yeah, me too, man, best, bro, let's go.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.720]   You'd be like, man, that is dysfunctional.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.000]   Jesus says, I love my bride so much, I died for her.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.280]   And there is clear or confident church hurt
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.440]   that is represented in this room.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.920]   But that's not an excuse for you to say,
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.760]   because of that hurt, and I bet it was real,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.720]   and I'm sorry that it happened,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.040]   for you to say, I'm gonna continue to not mature
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.680]   and I'm not gonna grow in my faith.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.360]   I'll stay a spiritual toddler when he's saying,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.760]   this is the means by which you grow.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.320]   And let me just press a little bit further.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.040]   If you are dating someone
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   and they're not connected to a church, that's concerning.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.960]   And there may be a whole story, I'm sure,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.120]   but here's another way of saying it.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.360]   If you're dating somebody
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.040]   and they still are dating churches,
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.880]   and they've been dating,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.080]   and they've been dating for like 18 months,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.560]   they're still, if they are dating churches
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.160]   for that long of amount of time,
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.300]   they probably shouldn't be dating you.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.200]   Because they're not connected.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.320]   They've already shown, man, I really don't make commitments.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.100]   And the Bible commands I am to be under the authority
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.720]   of elders, connected to a church that comes along,
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:20.160]   not to control me, to care for me,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.080]   to be a place where I can pour out and use my gifts
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.520]   and make an impact in the places where God has us.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.640]   And they're saying, no.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.600]   And you're basically saying,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.760]   I will continue to date someone who is telling God,
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.840]   I'm putting growing personally
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.600]   and maturing in my faith on hold.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.160]   That's at least concerning.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.140]   And it's definitely confusing.
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:49.860]   And so are you connected to a church, plugged in?
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.080]   It doesn't have to be this one.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.920]   Say all the time,
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.140]   we're not interested in stealing Christians.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.720]   We want you to experience what God has for you
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.980]   and go deeper into a church,
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.240]   to be connected with other people.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.200]   And when that's not happening,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.080]   you are missing out on growing in Christ.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.720]   So in conclusion, as believers,
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.160]   to live out a calling, it involves fighting for unity,
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.560]   it involves fulfilling our gifting.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.800]   God gave you gifts to use and not sit on the sidelines
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.400]   and then forge community to fight for.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   I'm gonna invite the band up
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.760]   and I'm gonna introduce you guys to some people
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.700]   that I did something similar at Awaken,
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.820]   but I want you guys to introduce,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.380]   especially those of you who are online,
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.380]   some of the most gifted, fun, godly people
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.560]   that I get to work with every single week
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.780]   and Hayden and the band that are coming out here.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.260]   So let me introduce some of these guys
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.620]   and they'll help illustrate something.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.060]   This is Hayden Browning.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.120]   You guys know Hayden?
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.680]   Every week, leads us in worship, put it up, Hayden.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:43.420]   Jesse over here on the drums, Estaban playing bass,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.820]   Wellington at guitar, Jacob guitar,
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.780]   my boy Adam Prince over here.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.420]   Every week, you know what they do?
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.320]   Yeah, you can get excited.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.340]   Every week, if you're in Ports Live,
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.780]   you probably haven't met these guys.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.500]   They lead us every single week in worship.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.820]   And you know what each of them have in common?
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.220]   They each have a different instrument
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.700]   and they each bring something different to the table.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.240]   And when they bring those gifts
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.140]   and they bring what their sound makes,
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.780]   they make beautiful songs.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.860]   And together, they're gonna show us
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.700]   what that even looks like.
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.220]   So they come together, they're playing, what is this?
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.180]   Build My Life?
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.820]   You're going build, oh, we got Build My Life.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.020]   Here we go, Build My Life.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.260]   They come together, you got drums beating over here,
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.060]   keys coming in, you got guitars,
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.420]   they're each playing their different instruments,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.620]   they're all playing in key together, all in concert.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.260]   And when all of them play together,
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.780]   the potential that they have individually
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.820]   is overshadowed by the way that they all come together.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.580]   And the one of them, if just Estaban was playing,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.880]   everybody stop at Estaban.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.820]   Stop playing.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.860]   It's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.380]   But whenever you bring all of them together,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.460]   it makes beautiful noise, beautiful songs.
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.500]   Y'all can play again.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.500]   But when all of them use their gifts and they say,
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.820]   hey, I wasn't made to be a guitar,
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.660]   I was made to be a drummer,
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.360]   and I wasn't made to play the keys,
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.620]   I was made to be a guitarist.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.980]   When they use their gifts and say,
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.300]   hey, I'm gonna be a part of this,
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.160]   they reach a greater potential together.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.740]   What else happens is when all of a sudden,
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.220]   you know, a couple of them stop playing,
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.940]   just you three stop playing and y'all three keep playing.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.500]   Without collectively all working together
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.100]   and all playing the song,
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.660]   the potential that could have been is diminished.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.300]   And when you take your life and you say,
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.020]   man, I'm just gonna go and I'm gonna work on,
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.100]   you know, building my Etsy page
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.180]   and my corporate America job and working for the weekend,
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:30.060]   you diminish the potential of what God wants to do
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.100]   in your life and wants to do through the church
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.340]   in your lifetime.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.060]   And the chance to be a part of that is only connected
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.780]   or is directly connected to you getting in the game
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.880]   and playing with them.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.220]   But when all of them begin to play together
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.720]   and they play in the right key
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.280]   and they play the right chord,
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.220]   it brings and all of a sudden something
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.820]   that was just so ordinary, isolated,
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.800]   is beautiful, purposeful,
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.220]   and impactful.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.420]   And I hope you hear tonight,
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.740]   God wants to use your life
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.740]   and you have eternal impact opportunities
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:11.660]   around you all the time.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.380]   And this short amount of life that you have
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.280]   and it feels long and when you're 25, you feel invincible.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.560]   And the truth of the scripture says,
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.100]   man, life, it's like a vapor.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.020]   It's like when you're cold and you breathe out
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.940]   in the air outside and there's the air there
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.780]   and then it's gone.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.580]   That's what the Bible says, your life is,
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.960]   how are you using it?
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.340]   Are you using the gifts that God has given you?
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.980]   Fighting for relationship and community with other people
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.400]   and building community that's leading to maturity.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.760]   'Cause if that's what you're doing, keep going.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.100]   And you are walking worthy of the calling
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.460]   that God has laid on your life.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.300]   Let me pray.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:39:00.140]   Father, I pray that you would move us to be on mission.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:07.180]   You'd move us to live more surrendered to you.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.060]   You'd use our life to make eternal impacts.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.820]   Would you help us to fight for unity and for oneness
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.460]   and against hurts and offenses
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.300]   and just all the different things that happen
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.840]   to all of us all the time.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.980]   And would your spirit just move us to serve you
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.820]   by serving others and building your church
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.200]   and being connected to your people and experiencing growth.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.660]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:49.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
