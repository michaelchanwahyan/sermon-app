[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.840]   Yeah, yeah, you know that lyric?
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.800]   That's some bad advice.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.880]   Y'all were singing it.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.320]   You were letting it wash over you, right?
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.200]   Not what was true and honorable and right and pure and lovely,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   whatever of good repute.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.040]   If there's anything worthy of excellence or--
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.580]   anything excellent or worthy of praise,
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.120]   let your mind dwell on these things.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160]   That song, man, it just washes over you.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.320]   And you're going to start to do this, don't you?
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.560]   We're young.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.560]   The Bible says, man, the glory of young man is their strength.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.280]   In other words, you think you're never going to die, man.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.440]   We're going to put the sun out.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.680]   I'm going to be around for a long time.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.640]   And we are young.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.760]   And we can burn bright.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.920]   And we can burn long.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.640]   And we can burn forever.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.840]   And there is nothing to do but to light it up.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440]   Get it while you can.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.080]   This is your 20s, man.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.620]   This is just the practice round.
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.240]   Let's go around a few times.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.520]   Let's not miss out now.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.840]   We'll have a chance to settle down later.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.960]   Ever heard that advice?
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.760]   Ever thought it?
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   Are you living it?
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.240]   A lot of you are.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.440]   Our buddy JP, I know him well, right?
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.840]   This was his story.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.200]   You know, he kind of grew up around church in a cultural way.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.280]   But then he went to college.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.960]   And he drifted.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.720]   Because when you're just around something
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.280]   in a cultural way, whatever culture you're around
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.760]   is going to jump on you.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.440]   And it jumped all over JP, man.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   He was being totally influenced by it.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.680]   He was letting a lot of alcohol run through him.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.480]   And he was trying to run through everything
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.840]   he could put his hands on.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   And his life was a wreck.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.000]   And after a week, man, he couldn't sleep.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.720]   He was nervous.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.680]   He was laying in bed.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.440]   He picked up the phone.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.240]   He called a friend.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.880]   And he said, man, I am stressed out.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.640]   I don't know what to do.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.080]   I'm supposed to be having the time of my life.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.840]   I'm doing all the things that people say will make you
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.040]   have the time of your life.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.520]   What am I supposed to do?
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160]   And the advice he got on the other end of that phone
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.520]   was this, man, hey, that's what we do, bro.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.480]   This is the years.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.760]   You go get it while you can.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.840]   Treat yourself.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.340]   Right?
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.920]   This is the day to live it up.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.160]   You can grow up later.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.400]   Right?
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   You be a lug.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.160]   You be a lesbian until graduation.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.200]   And then you can go find you a man and raise the house,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.360]   get you a little white picket fence.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.400]   Ever heard that?
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.640]   It's worked its way into your vocabulary.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.840]   And if there is any lie that is built into youth,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.440]   it is I can get serious about my life later.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.880]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.560]   You ever heard the phrase, you've been around sports?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.680]   You're going to play like you practice?
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.480]   I hear it all the time.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.160]   You end up playing like you practice.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160]   We've talked about this.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   Some of the bad advice we've already discussed here,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.000]   try it before you buy it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.320]   But what we don't know is when we experience intense pleasure,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.240]   our body shoots off chemicals that literally hardwires
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.520]   our brain and all of our senses to be
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.360]   attached to certain behaviors.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.880]   It identifies certain opportunities,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.360]   certain experiences with intense pleasure.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.000]   And our brain wants to run back to those things.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.320]   We become hardwired because we are practicing this.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.480]   We're practicing, practicing this
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.680]   is what you do to find pleasure.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.360]   And bro, you just can't just switch that off.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.280]   Because you have ingrained in your mind
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.080]   that is the way to roll.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.920]   When you start to say, get it while you can, get it now,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.960]   treat yourself, you ain't treating yourself.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.400]   You are training yourself.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.240]   That song, man, we're going to burn bright in the sun.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   We're never going to have any bad times.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.920]   That song in itself already exposes its own lie.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.680]   You ever listen to all the lyrics?
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   He's talking about the fact that some other dude there
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.560]   in sunglasses is trying to move in on you.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.080]   And the reason you're away from me
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.160]   is because I left a scar on you that hurts you.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.280]   I ain't made it right yet.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.320]   But maybe you'll get drunk enough tonight.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.600]   And maybe when you just want to fall down, I'll be there
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.680]   and I'll carry you home.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.640]   And then he wants to just sing that siren song
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.560]   one more time, I'll be that guy that'll help you
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.040]   get that life that you want.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.280]   That song, that lie's been around for a long time.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.480]   You scroll that back 30 years.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.360]   And there was a song when I was your age.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.800]   It was the summer before I came to really understand
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.560]   what I want to talk to you about tonight,
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.400]   about where life can really be found.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.960]   And it's a song called "Only the Good Die Young," man.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.200]   I'll play it for you in just a second.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.360]   It's the idea that if you want to live a good life,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.980]   if you don't want to get it while you can,
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.160]   if you don't want to treat yourself,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   if you want to be burdened by the religion
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.640]   and the laws of old,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   then you're going to die a young death.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.480]   Over here, we're living it up.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.320]   This is where the party is.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.660]   This is where it's brighter than the sun.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.720]   That lie's been around for a long time.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.480]   Here's the way I heard it, okay, in the 70s.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.820]   Check it out.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.720]   All right, man, hey, I remember hearing that.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.080]   I sung it, I sung it all summer long.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.840]   I was convinced at that line,
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.920]   and Billy Joel writes in there,
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.400]   "Come on, Virginia," is the reason he chose that name.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.900]   That little stained glass curtain you're hiding behind,
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.600]   all right, he's saying, "You got to come out
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.780]   "where the sun really shines, where the sun is.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.200]   "You're getting muted sunlight.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.360]   "You're being lied to.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   "Come on, Virginia, get on out here where life is."
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   That song's been around for a long time.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.300]   You wanna know how long?
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.960]   Not just 30 years ago, thousands of years.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560]   And if there is a loving father,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.020]   he would do everything he could
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.280]   to put a new song in your heart.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.860]   See, this is what happens when you really understand
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.240]   who God is and that he's not trying to rip you off,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760]   he's trying to set you free.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.320]   It changes your tune, man.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.160]   It changes the way you roll,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.760]   and you're not gonna go get you some.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.560]   You're gonna go get all you can of where real life resides.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.480]   Can I just tell you something, man?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.400]   Nobody looks at you and thinks you're a fool
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.000]   because you're being seduced by the things
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.920]   that you're being seduced by
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.200]   because that is the story of humankind,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.840]   and it's especially the story of youth.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.500]   If there's a verse in my Bible
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.800]   that I have seen evidenced again and again
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.440]   in the lives of men and in my life, it's this.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.720]   It's in Ecclesiastes chapter eight, verse 11.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.260]   It says this, "Because the sentence against an evil deed
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.880]   "is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of men
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   "among them are given fully to do evil."
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.360]   In other words, you get away with something,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.540]   you go, that didn't really hurt, or that wasn't too bad,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.600]   or it hadn't stung enough yet,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.320]   and so you just go back for more,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.160]   and you think that, hey, I think I'm gonna be the one
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.000]   that gets away with this.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.400]   I'm gonna be the one that does party now,
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.840]   and I will grow up later.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.520]   This is just the practice round.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.040]   Actually, it's not even the practice round.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.500]   I'm not training for anything.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   This is recess, and it's time for me to play.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.120]   I'll grow up later, but what you don't understand
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.760]   is that you are growing into something
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.200]   that you're not gonna like.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.800]   I love, you know, different signs that you see
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   around when you're driving.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.880]   You know, I can remember, my buddy and I
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.160]   were driving through Arkansas one time.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160]   We were in this little, little town, and it said,
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.240]   you know, such and such Arkansas, home of Jim Bad News Brown,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.960]   or Jim Bad News Barnes, rather,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   and we thought, that is hilarious.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.480]   We have no idea who Jim Bad News was.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.280]   We literally, in this little town in Arkansas,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.160]   drove to what you would imagine is there,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.560]   like this little, you know, like malt shop,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.020]   barber shop kind of thing.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.440]   We walked in, and we go, who's Jim Bad News Barnes?
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.240]   And they go, oh, you know about Bad News?
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.800]   And some five old men in the corner
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.600]   started talking about Jim Bad News Barnes,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   how amazing he was.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.920]   They go, was Jim Bad News still living?
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.080]   They go, no, but his mama does,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.120]   so we went over to Jim Bad News Barnes' mama's house,
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.840]   (congregation laughs)
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.040]   it's the first time I ever had fried green tomatoes.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.400]   We just knocked on the door, literally,
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.960]   just to make an experience, we knocked on the door,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.840]   we go, we understand Jim Bad News Barnes used to live here,
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.200]   and she goes, yes, he did, and she opened the door,
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.600]   showed us all the pictures, all the newspapers she had cut,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.720]   I had to play in the NBA way back in the day
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.400]   before I even knew about it, for the Celtics,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.440]   and we sat down there, we had fried green tomatoes,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.920]   and laughed with this woman,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   and just talked about how amazing,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.040]   now, she lives in a town that's well-known
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.640]   because of her son who grew up there.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.400]   I love street signs, I love town signs,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.920]   I always read 'em, I saw one, no kidding,
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.940]   one time, it said this, it said, it was a gas station,
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.600]   it said, we sell Mexican food,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.560]   we have gas on the exact same sign, right there.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.520]   (congregation laughs)
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.960]   I go, how obvious is that, right there, okay?
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.680]   There's a street sign I've never seen
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.780]   'cause I've never been to Alaska,
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.840]   but the street sign says this,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.840]   when you leave certain parts of cities in Alaska,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.600]   especially as you move towards the colder months,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.640]   which there's a lot of 'em up there
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.140]   if you haven't paid attention to your world geography,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.360]   once cars start to travel, what they do is they make ruts,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.820]   and from town to town, you literally get in a rut,
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.640]   and you drive in that rut from one town to another
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.560]   until you get to a turnaround, you come back,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.200]   and so, this rut goes to this town,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.400]   this rut goes to that town,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.040]   and so, there's all kinds of signs that says,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.200]   choose your rut wisely, you'll be in it
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.120]   for the next 60 miles, the next 200 miles,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.720]   the next 50 miles, let me just tell you something,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.560]   it's a lie that you can jump the rut.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.960]   This, treat yourself, this, get it while you can,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.200]   this is, I'll grow up later,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.440]   what you're doing is you're jumping in a rut,
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.480]   and some of you guys will sit there,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.640]   and you'll go, how did I get here?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.320]   Why can't I turn this around?
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.680]   Now, I'm gonna tell you tonight,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.560]   about a God who will restore the years
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.400]   that the locusts have eaten,
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.560]   and though your sins are red as scarlet,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.480]   he'll make them white as snow,
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.360]   but you gotta start dealing with some of the lies
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.180]   that you've listened to,
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.640]   there's another verse in Scripture that says this,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.520]   it says that we should encourage each other,
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.420]   day after day, as long as it's called today,
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.520]   so we won't be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.360]   Part of the deceitfulness of sin,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.680]   is that we think we're gonna be the one
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   that plays with it, not get owned by it.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.360]   We're gonna be the one that thinks we can beat it.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.720]   We're gonna be the one that thinks
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.280]   that it's not gonna grab a hold of us,
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.720]   and train us, till we become somebody
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.360]   we never thought we'd be.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.520]   I told you, these songs have been around for a long time.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.840]   You guys know who Homer is?
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.560]   Not Simpson, all right, all right.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.520]   The one who wrote the Iliad,
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.000]   that book you didn't read in high school,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.600]   remember that, or college?
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.880]   That Homer.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.160]   He wrote about Ulysses, or Odysseus, right?
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.420]   And even the ancient Greeks understood
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.480]   there are certain siren songs,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.380]   you remember that little part of that mythological part
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.380]   of Odysseus' story, where every man that sailed
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.640]   by this island, where those three sisters were,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.160]   whose song was so amazing, and so sweet,
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.280]   and so seductive, that they couldn't help
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.560]   but navigate their sails, and turn the rudder,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.600]   so that their ship would sail towards that beautiful song,
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.720]   and life after life was lost there,
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.900]   because every ship was wrecked on the jagged reefs
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.760]   that were there in that bay,
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.360]   where they thought they were sailing to life,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.400]   but they knew they were sailing to death.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.960]   Can I give you the antidote to the siren song
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.800]   of fun, of Billy Joel?
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.200]   You guys remember what Odysseus did?
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.880]   He wanted to hear the song, which was a bit foolish,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.840]   but at least he had the sense to tie himself to the mast.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.880]   He had all the other men on his ship
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.200]   put wax in their ears to prohibit them
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.280]   from listening to this seductive song
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.260]   that ruins the lives of men, and he said to them,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.520]   no matter what I say to you,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.240]   you do not cut me off that pole.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   You strap me to the mast, until we get past that harbor
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.800]   to the other side.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.960]   Don't you listen.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.800]   You better make sure that your mind is not perverted
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.640]   by what is not true, what is not honorable,
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.240]   what is not right, what is not pure,
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.140]   what is not lovely, what is not worthy of praise,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.160]   that isn't excellent.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.120]   You gotta put wax in your ears on that stuff,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.860]   or you're gonna keep sailing towards it.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.280]   It's amazing, man, we know that song
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.440]   is the reason I kinda played that before we came out here.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.280]   Those songs are seductive, and we don't know it,
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.300]   but it's just moving us towards this idea
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.520]   that God's not good.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.340]   If God was good, he'd let me run on over there
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.940]   to where all my friends are, higher than the empire.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.640]   And it's a lie.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.100]   And I've lived long enough to see it.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.380]   You guys know that a number of years ago,
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.220]   we started putting on the packages of cigarettes.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.060]   We didn't used to do that.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.460]   The tobacco industry had a major grip on our economy,
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.500]   and the lobbyists of the tobacco industry
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   were major informing the way Congress made laws,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.860]   and eventually, when they showed
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.180]   the addictive power of nicotine,
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.060]   they started to put on cigarette packages
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.000]   warning labels that said, hey, man, listen,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.340]   this could cost you your health,
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.540]   and maybe even your life, you remember that?
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.580]   Most of us didn't grow up in a smoking generation.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.740]   I did, my parents smoked when I was young.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.940]   Almost everybody did.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.140]   In cars, unfiltered cigarettes.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.740]   My grandfather, I hardly ever remember him
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.940]   without a cigarette in his mouth.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.860]   But let me just tell you, man,
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.100]   the addictive nature of tobacco is overwhelming.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.540]   It's unbelievable, it ruins,
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.140]   and I'm looking for just pieces here to walk you through it.
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.120]   Person after person, there's not an aspect of your body,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.700]   not a single organ that isn't affected by it.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.060]   There are little hair-like creatures on your lungs
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.540]   that move like this, and the tar and the nicotine
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.540]   clogs them up, and it keeps the healthy part of your lungs
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.680]   from trapping the poisons and the toxins
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.760]   that you're exposed to, that ultimately,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.660]   because it can't clean it, cancer sticks to your lungs.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.240]   Still, 90% of all lung cancer patients,
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.720]   it's still the number one cause of death in our country
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.120]   from cancer is lung cancer,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.500]   and 90% of lung cancer patients are smokers.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.020]   Here's a picture of a healthy lung, right here.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.200]   The little black specks are just what happens
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.360]   when you live in the city.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.880]   It's a lung, a healthy lung from a city
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.400]   that's pollution that happens.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.400]   This is the picture of a smoker's lung.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.240]   Look at that.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.440]   Now, you look at that white part,
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.480]   you go, well, there's still some part
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.320]   that's not contaminated.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.440]   That's cancer.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.560]   That's what killed 'em.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.280]   And you look at that, what's so amazing is people go,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.120]   well, man, I don't inhale.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.800]   Even if I inhale, I'm exhaling all of it.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.860]   Do you know that when you take in a cigarette,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.440]   when you exhale, 90% of the smoke that you inhale,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.560]   no matter how much you did, 90% of what you inhaled
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.000]   is not exhaled.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.720]   It sticks in you, and it creates a corrosive element
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.440]   not just to your lungs, but to every part of your body.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.840]   And people go, I'll just smoke for a little bit,
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.760]   I'll get rid of it, and then there's addictive nature
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.960]   to the behavior, just as addictive as heroin.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.720]   And so eventually, we just started to warn people,
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.240]   you best not mess with that,
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.600]   even if it makes you look cool when you're young.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.000]   Probably not as many smokers here as there used to be,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.280]   but those of you that smoke know about the addictive nature,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.680]   and some of you guys go, who will smoke?
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.720]   That's just nasty.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:02.760]   But you know, every generation's got its cigarettes, man.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.360]   This generation's cigarettes is just, hey,
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.860]   same sex experimentation.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.600]   Just kinda everybody does it.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.840]   I'll just jump off that little track later.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.680]   Or who knows what it might be.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.860]   But it's out there, and it's alive.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.260]   This song's been around a lot longer than Homer.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.840]   About 400, 500 years before Homer,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.080]   there was another little piece of literature
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.400]   that was written, it's called Proverbs.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   Proverbs I love because it is written to fools like me,
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.480]   and they're short, and they're easy to follow.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.920]   Listen to Proverbs chapter one, are you ready?
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.680]   The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.300]   to know wisdom and instruction,
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.080]   to discern the sayings of understanding,
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.320]   to receive instruction in wise behavior,
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.880]   righteousness, justice, and equity.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.680]   Man, that's good stuff right there.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:00.520]   To give prudence to the naive, the impressionable,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.160]   those who think they've got it all figured out
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.460]   who don't need help from anybody.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.360]   To the youth, knowledge and discretion.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.440]   A wise man is gonna hear and increase in learning,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.720]   and a man of understanding will acquire wisdom.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.140]   That's the job of a young man or young woman,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.200]   is to become wise.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.680]   The word wise means skilled in living.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.480]   If you're not skilled in living, you're in trouble.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.600]   When you get around kids, kids don't know the difference
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.520]   between a rope and a snake, a curb and a cliff.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.400]   And they need somebody to protect them.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   And I'm just telling you, when you're young,
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.440]   you think you've got it all figured out,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.880]   that previous generations jacked the stuff,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.920]   and maybe they got away with it,
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.960]   or it looks like they got away with it,
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.160]   but I'm gonna get away with it.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.640]   Now's recess.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.640]   I'm not training for anything, I'm just having fun.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.700]   It says to understand a proverb and a figure,
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.820]   verse six, the words of the wise and their riddles.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.640]   I love that, the words of the wise and their riddles.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.540]   I love riddles.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.460]   And what it's saying is, sometimes,
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.260]   what it means to live a skilled life
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.260]   is like a riddle to some people, you don't understand it.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.700]   Sometimes you hear older people say things,
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.140]   and you kind of cock your head like a dog
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.060]   who's hearing a strange noise,
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.260]   you can't really figure it out.
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.380]   Even in Proverbs, when you go and read,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.260]   in Proverbs chapter 14, it says that,
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.900]   it says, "Where the oxen are,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.560]   "where there are no oxen, the manger is clean.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.900]   "But much increase comes by the strength of the ox."
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.300]   And you're kind of like,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.460]   that's not like something my dad would say,
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.200]   it makes no sense to me.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.140]   It's a riddle, and what it basically talks about is,
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.100]   hey, if you want a nice, clean, exact life
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.780]   with no trouble, no manure laying around, okay,
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.020]   then don't have any oxen.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.060]   Be an inflexible person who likes everything
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.420]   in its perfect order and doesn't have your life interrupted.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.180]   But here's the thing, oxen produce a lot of good.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:51.580]   But relationships are messy, friendships are messy,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.900]   community is messy.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.340]   And if you don't want any messes,
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.780]   then just go ahead and isolate yourself.
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.540]   But much increase comes from the strength of an ox.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.460]   It's like a riddle.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.300]   Don't you love riddles?
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.260]   I love riddles, right?
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.340]   I ask my kids all the time, hey, hey, kids,
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.040]   you know what happens when you throw a white hat
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.880]   into the Red Sea?
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.820]   And they go, I don't know.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.660]   What happens, y'all know?
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.220]   It gets wet, that's the answer, all right?
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.500]   So you're too smart for yourself, you overthink, right?
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.280]   But I love riddles like this one.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.220]   So I like to ask my kids this one.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.120]   What's so delicate that even saying its name will break it?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.100]   That's right, I heard it, silence, silence.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.420]   How about this one?
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.740]   What is something that you throw away the outside
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   and you cook the inside, then you eat the outside
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.040]   and throw away the inside?
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.780]   I'll give it to you again, you ready?
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.720]   I love riddles.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.620]   You throw away the outside, you eat the inside.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.460]   Excuse me, you throw away the outside, you cook the inside,
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.020]   then you eat the outside and throw away the inside.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.060]   Ear of corn, isn't that good?
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.180]   I like that one, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.580]   All right, here's a good one, all right?
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.300]   This is one because, yeah, you're like,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.860]   (growling)
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.540]   Should've known that, should've known that, right?
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.780]   That's what you're gonna say when you're 35, all right?
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.180]   And you got scars and your lungs are nasty,
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.540]   you go, I should've known that
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.040]   because somebody told you the answer to the riddle.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.560]   It seems so obvious, doesn't it?
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.700]   Once you know the answer to a riddle,
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.740]   that's why you murmur, it seems so stinking obvious.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.660]   Like, look, man, all of us,
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.060]   you ever watch that spelling bee?
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.820]   Those kids that get those words right
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.660]   and they know all the word words
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.780]   and all that different stuff?
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.020]   I mean, there's one, somebody asked me this one time
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.140]   at a stump, they go, hey, what word, I guarantee you,
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.580]   what word in the English language
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.460]   is always spelled incorrectly?
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.200]   Incorrectly, that's exactly right, all right?
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.060]   It's always spelled that way, every time,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.420]   even those kids in the spelling bee,
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.720]   they spell it incorrectly.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.940]   I love riddles, all right?
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.560]   Let me tell you something, life is a riddle.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.660]   And until somebody, until somebody gives you the answer, man,
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.180]   it's gonna mess with you and jack you up.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.680]   Now, I want you to watch where Proverbs goes next.
[00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.380]   Because the way you answer this one question,
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.620]   like, why are you here, where are you from?
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.900]   Who created you, is there a creator, is he good?
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.660]   How do I get the most out of life?
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.320]   Where is life really?
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.600]   How you answer that question
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.500]   is the most important thing about you.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.260]   Look what Proverbs 1 goes on to say.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.460]   Man, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.260]   That's even a riddle because you think, man, fear,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.580]   I don't wanna be scared of it, no, listen,
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.420]   here's what I'm gonna tell you,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.160]   I do my job in the next few minutes.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.620]   You'll have a proper fear of the Lord.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.340]   And what I mean by that is you'll respect him,
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.980]   you'll know him for who he is,
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.020]   and you'll be somebody that goes,
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.380]   I don't wanna miss another word
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.040]   that comes out of his mouth.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.500]   If it is true that he is a sun and a shield,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.200]   that he gives life and light, okay?
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.180]   Everybody else is just saying,
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.280]   hey, we're trying to be brighter than the sun.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.340]   That's what people have always done.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.260]   I don't need God, I'll be my own God.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.520]   God is a sun and a shield.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.780]   He is a provider of life.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:11.460]   He causes things to grow, he gives light and direction,
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.860]   and he is a protector.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.860]   He gives, watch this, grace and glory.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.300]   When you think about God, this is Psalm 84, 11.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.980]   When you think about God, what do you think of?
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.100]   If you don't think about God as a gift giver,
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.900]   that he gives you stuff you don't deserve, that's grace.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.900]   And he gives you, watch this, glory, not momentary beauty.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.540]   That youth promises will please you forever.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.840]   No, it fades.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.540]   God gives you glory.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.980]   I tell my little girls, man, you pursue true beauty.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.660]   Bodies deteriorate, persons develop.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.200]   God wants to make you glorious and beautiful
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.500]   so that others look at you, not just in your 20s,
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.780]   in your best times.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.940]   He wants people to look at you for decades
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.340]   and just go, that is a life, that is a man.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.080]   If we multiply that kind of human,
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.480]   this would be a better place.
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.720]   Not if I could get that human to do what I wanna do
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.720]   for a second, it would give me pleasure.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.920]   But God just says, hey man, I wanna give you life.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.440]   I want you to be a life giver to others.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.560]   I don't want you to seek pleasure from other people.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.000]   I want you to find the pleasure that is in me.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.840]   And you are, when you become convinced
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.880]   that that's who God is, that he's not looking
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.800]   to rip you off, but looking to set you free,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.620]   you're gonna be like this every time he speaks.
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.460]   Tell me more of God.
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.280]   What's he give?
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.260]   He's given more grace, more glory.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.380]   I want more of that.
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.980]   Watch this, the next verse in Psalm 84 says this.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.980]   No good thing does he withhold from those who love him.
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.900]   What's the bad advice tonight?
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.900]   The bad advice tonight is get it while you can.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.560]   Treat yourself, go get what the world has to offer.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.780]   I'm telling you, the world is lying to you.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.340]   The song's always been sung.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.060]   From Homer's time to my time in the '70s
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.460]   to your time in the teens.
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.080]   And there's always been a loving father
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.140]   who wants to say this to you.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.180]   Watch this.
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.580]   Hear my son, my daughter, your father's instruction.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.960]   This is verse eight.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.860]   Do not forsake your mother's teaching.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.520]   Indeed, there are graceful, watch this,
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.140]   a graceful wreath to your head
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.060]   and ornaments about your neck, my son,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.080]   if sinners entice you, and they will.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.940]   Their songs are everywhere.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.520]   Do not consent.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.100]   Now watch this.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.920]   Tell me, see if your father in heaven
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.060]   understands the siren songs you hear.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.600]   I hear 'em all the time.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.860]   If they say, come with us, let us lie and wait for blood,
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.700]   let us ambush the innocent without cause,
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.700]   let us swaddle them alive like sheol,
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.340]   even whole as those who grab 'em at the pit,
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.140]   we will find all kinds of precious wealth.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.820]   We will fill our houses with spoil.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.900]   Throw in your lot with us.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.220]   We shall all have one purse.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.460]   (laughing)
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.540]   Right?
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.000]   Just, whenever I read that, I read it
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.520]   with that kind of build, and it's like I see a pirate.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.360]   He's like, let's go rape the women.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.120]   Let's go get the booty, right?
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.960]   Pirate's booty.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.640]   And let's, you know, let's go.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.320]   And I read that, I'm like, yeah, man,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.260]   that looks like the ship to sail with.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.480]   Those guys don't have to really work.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.440]   Everybody thinks they're cool.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.520]   They make movies about 'em.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.000]   Everybody wants to be Johnny Depp.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.760]   And you're like, gosh, you know, should I go?
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.860]   Right, every time I read that, I get that.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.640]   Let me just, just for a second,
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.360]   let me just take you over and leave this metaphor
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.900]   for a second, let me show you an amazing section
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.280]   of scripture here in Proverbs chapter seven.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.360]   Watch, this one's a little bit more seductive.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.880]   It uses seductive language.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.960]   I mean, you read this, you're almost like,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.820]   gosh, I'm not even sure I should read this.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.760]   First of all, we'll set it up.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.640]   Proverbs seven, verses one through four.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.600]   My son, keep my words.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.000]   Think of a pleading father who loves you,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.480]   who's not trying to rip you off.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.700]   He's trying to keep you from that disease,
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.360]   from that being used for a moment and discarded.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.440]   Treasure what I'm saying to you.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.360]   Keep my commandments and live.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.280]   And my teaching is the apple of your eye
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.260]   at the center of your thought.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.280]   Bind them on your fingers.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.060]   Write them on the tablet of your heart.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.360]   Say to wisdom, you are my sister,
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.840]   and call understanding your intimate friend.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   Why, watch this.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.360]   That wisdom and understanding will keep you
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.760]   from an adulteress, from that beautiful,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.420]   dark-skinned woman who flatters with her words.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.320]   For at the window of my house,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.520]   I looked out through my lattice.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.480]   I see it happen every day.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.440]   I saw among the naive and discerned among the youths
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.560]   a young man lacking sense.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.160]   Passing through the street near her corner,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.880]   he takes the way to her house.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.520]   In the twilight, in the evening, it's getting dark.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.440]   He can move in the shadows, in the middle of the night,
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.360]   in the darkness, behold, here she comes,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.800]   a woman comes to meet him, dressed as a harlot,
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.420]   beautiful, silky, cunning of heart.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.080]   She is boisterous, rebellious, seductive.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.020]   Her feet do not remain at home.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.640]   She is now in the streets, now in the square.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.920]   She lurks by every corner.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.040]   She seizes him and kisses him.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.920]   With a brazen face, she says to him,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.520]   I was due to offer peace offerings today.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:11.840]   That was my excuse to get out.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.140]   Today I have paid my peace vows.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.480]   Therefore, I've come out to meet you,
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.960]   to seek your presence earnestly.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.800]   I love you.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.620]   You're what I need.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.560]   You can make me happy.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.480]   I have found you.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.720]   I have spread my couch with coverings,
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.240]   with colored linens of Egypt.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.120]   I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.680]   This is kind of like, you know,
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.880]   Proverbs 7 porn is what this is.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.000]   I'm not kidding.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.880]   And you watch this, here it goes.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.960]   Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.720]   Let us delight ourselves with caresses,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.040]   for my husband is not home.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.360]   He has gone on a long journey.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.520]   He has taken a bag of money with him.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.240]   At full moon, he will come home
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.680]   with her many persuasions, I guess.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.960]   She entices him.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.280]   Come, get it now.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.380]   With her flattering lips, she seduces him.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.540]   See, this is where most of us just kind of go
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.820]   to a blackout phase.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.160]   And we get lost in the fantasy
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.720]   of how amazing it would be to be pursued
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.360]   by that beautiful woman.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.920]   We've imagined her time after time.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.560]   Each time we do, we have chemicals that fire in our brain
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.120]   that hardwire us to want her more.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.320]   We put these images before us and we fantasize
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.400]   until finally we go out and we numb ourselves
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.720]   and drink so that we can be a little bit less discerning
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.400]   so that we can move towards her,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.340]   maybe in that bar and be as high as an empire building.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.000]   And then maybe we can just have a little bit of that light
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.600]   when God all the time is saying, I am your son.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.520]   I am your shield.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.720]   Listen to me, watch this.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.120]   Look at what happens 'cause I wanna wake you up.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.960]   'Cause the story's not over when she arches her back.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.040]   This is the truth.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.520]   Suddenly he follows her.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.800]   As an ox goes to the slaughter or as one in fetters
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.360]   to the discipline of a fool.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.500]   Until an arrow pierces through his liver, that is fatal.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.480]   As a bird hastens to the snare,
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.760]   what kind of bird does that?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.040]   So he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.320]   Now therefore my son, listen to me.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.960]   Come up out of your little pornographic imaging
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.080]   about how pleasant it will be.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.940]   Pay attention to the words of my mouth.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.480]   Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.280]   Don't stray into her paths for many are the victims
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.920]   she has cast down and numerous all her slain.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.040]   Her house is the way to hell.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.720]   Descending to the chambers of death.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.640]   Another proverb early on says,
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.400]   you will be reduced to a loaf of bread.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:50.540]   He goes, he does not know that the dead are there.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.800]   But she is seductive.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.720]   Come treat yourself.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:03.160]   Back to Proverbs one of the pirates, look at this.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:09.520]   Verse 15, my son, little interlude,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.120]   do not walk in the way with him.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.640]   Keep your feet from their path.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.400]   For their feet run to evil, they hasten to shed blood.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.560]   Indeed, it's useless to spread the bait of net
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.400]   in the sight of a bird.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.440]   Birds have more sense.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.800]   Bird brains, small brains have the sense
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.040]   to not go near a net.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.000]   People who go there, they lie in wait,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.960]   who live like this, they lie in wait for their own blood.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.360]   They ambush their own lives.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.400]   They're ruining their own lives.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.960]   I know it looks like they're having fun.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.880]   I know the commercials say they're having fun.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.780]   I know it looks like Vegas is having fun.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.400]   But the dead are there.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:49.020]   So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.720]   It takes away the life of its possessors.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.360]   That's just a dad trying to, you know what the son said?
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.320]   Not dad, not me, it won't take my life.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.120]   Let me just show you some pictures of some of your friends
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.080]   maybe that are out there.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.240]   And this is one that had a big night on the town
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.320]   and it didn't go exactly like they wanted, okay?
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.840]   'Cause they were busted, they were popped, okay?
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.320]   They went out there, they were bumming the folks.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   They said, "Come on, man, play with me."
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.000]   And okay, there were some of the unlucky ones
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.120]   that had a little bit too much.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.520]   They didn't have a designated driver.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.480]   So they got arrested.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.080]   So there's a little smirk, I'm 18, yeah, you got me.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.920]   All right, so tonight I'm a perp,
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.780]   but I'm gonna party again.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:28.160]   Let's keep reading.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.560]   Verse 20, wisdom shouts in the streets.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.140]   She lifts her voice in the square.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.280]   At the head of the noisy street, she cries out, man.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.240]   Or at the porch on Tuesday nights, she cries out.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.740]   And at the entrance of the city gates,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.620]   she utters her sayings.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.360]   How long, oh, naive ones, will you love being simple-minded
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.880]   and scoffers delight themselves in scoffing
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.640]   and fools hate knowledge?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.660]   Turn to my reproof.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.860]   This is what we're doing here tonight.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.560]   Turn to the reproof.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.160]   Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.320]   I'm not mad at you, sweetie.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.620]   I'm not mad at you, son.
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.460]   I just don't want you to give yourself to the harlot
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.340]   'cause I know where that will lead.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.160]   Come, and by the way, expand this.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.600]   Expand this well beyond just physical intimacy
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.520]   with somebody who's not your spouse.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.680]   This is any air, it is any voice that says,
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.380]   God doesn't have your best interests in mind.
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.680]   Come on, man, you don't need that old-time religion.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.340]   No, you don't need old-time religion.
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.960]   You need the ancient of days who is a loving father
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.400]   who wants to make all your ways peace,
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.720]   who wants to train you up in godliness
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.020]   so that guilt and shame and sorrow
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.420]   will not define your life.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.420]   He wants to be a blessing to you.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.960]   It's who God is.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.940]   He's kind.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.860]   Listen to what it says.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.900]   How long will you love being simple-minded
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.740]   and scoffers delight?
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:55.560]   Turn to my reproof.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.500]   I'll pour out my spirit on you.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.220]   Verse 24, because I called, watch this,
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.980]   and you refused, because I stretched out my hand
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.820]   and no one paid attention
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.100]   because you kept sowing,
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   and because you didn't reap,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.400]   the hearts of men among you were given fully to do evil.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.340]   This is what it says.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.720]   You neglected all my counsel.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.560]   You didn't want my reproof.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.680]   Listen, this is Proverbs 1.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.900]   This is God just telling you.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.740]   This is the way it's gonna be.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.680]   I'm not mad at you.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.040]   You're free to make your own choices,
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.920]   but you're not free to choose your consequences.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.120]   This is the law of the harvest.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.420]   You reap what you sow.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.840]   You reap more than you sowed,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.560]   and you reap it later than you sowed it.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.660]   There's a reason that you put that seed of evil
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.960]   in your life, and right away, it doesn't grow poison
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.680]   because it takes a while for it to germinate and die.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.200]   And then eventually, it gets roots,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.440]   and then it bursts up through the soil,
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.080]   and all of a sudden, it overtakes your house,
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.460]   and you're living underneath its shade,
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.180]   and it's feeding you things that are bitter.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.400]   It takes time.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.560]   You put one seed in the ground,
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.260]   it grows a whole plant of trouble.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.520]   And God's just saying, listen,
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.780]   I tried to spare you from that.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.620]   Watch this.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.720]   You neglected my counsel, verse 25.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.080]   You didn't want my reproof.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.000]   Now, this is wisdom talking, not God.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.260]   I will laugh at your calamity.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.420]   I will mock at you when your dread comes.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.740]   When your dread comes like a storm,
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.300]   and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.100]   when distress and anguish come upon you, and they will.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.100]   Then you will finally call on me on wisdom,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:11.940]   but I will not answer.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.500]   They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.860]   You're gonna be trapped.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.620]   Watch this, because they hated knowledge,
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:18.940]   because they bought the lie, they took the bad advice.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.100]   This is recess.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.860]   I can grow up later.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.900]   Because they hated knowledge, they did not choose
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.620]   to listen tenderly to a loving Father
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.620]   who wanted to protect them.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.700]   They would not accept my counsel.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:33.660]   They spurned all my reproof.
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.500]   Watch this.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.020]   So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:42.780]   and be satiated with their own devices.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.580]   For the waywardness of the naive will kill them,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.660]   and the complacencies of fools will destroy them.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.400]   Do you see that, guys?
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.800]   You gotta begin with the end in mind.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.780]   It is a habit of highly successful people.
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.780]   It's habit number one.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.220]   You gotta begin with the end in mind.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.060]   And you know what youth do?
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.540]   The youth go, I'll worry about the end later.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.520]   That is why it says, by the same author in another book,
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.340]   it is better to go to the house of mourning,
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.920]   Ecclesiastes 7, 2, than it is to the house of feasting.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.160]   Because that is the end of every man,
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.900]   and the living take it to heart.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.180]   It's why it says in verse four,
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.340]   the mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.940]   while the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.980]   It's better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.260]   than for one to listen to the song of fools.
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:38.180]   So you get to decide, man.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.980]   You get to decide what the ingredients are
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.860]   that you put into the mixing bowl of your life.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.940]   And God's not mad at you.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.900]   Here's the thing, wisdom will mock you,
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.700]   but your heavenly Father is right here tonight.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.300]   He's just saying, just stop, just stop.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.720]   I am a God who makes all things new,
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.180]   but you've gotta stop throwing those things
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.220]   into the bowl of your life
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.260]   and wondering why you're miserable.
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.780]   You gotta stop asking me why the cake
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.560]   of your existence tastes this way.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.340]   You gotta quit saying to me, why did I do this to you?
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.560]   I didn't do this to you.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.520]   I gave you a recipe card
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.820]   that was gonna make life pleasant.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.300]   This is Proverbs 22, four.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.000]   Proverbs 22, four, one of the most amazing proverbs
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.440]   in all of the scripture, the reward of humility
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.400]   and the fear of the Lord are, watch,
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   riches, honor, and life.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.800]   See, what's the enemy told you, man?
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.720]   There's no life over there.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.100]   You gotta listen.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.400]   It's just the opposite.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.640]   You know what some bad advice is?
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.540]   Go get you some.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:41.600]   You know what some great advice is?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.900]   Go get all of God's you can while you're young.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.820]   Get him now while you still can enjoy.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.200]   Oh, remember our friends that were trying
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.040]   to get us to go party?
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.640]   I know they got rung up and busted.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.520]   Okay, they got out of jail.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.560]   They went out and they partied some more.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.920]   Well, the second time they got arrested,
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.720]   this is what one of 'em looked like.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.000]   It goes on from there.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.800]   Another one of our buddies, she got arrested again
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.820]   or he got arrested again.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.120]   This is the second time he got busted.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120]   He was a three-time loser.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.680]   This is what he looks like now.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.120]   Oh yeah, there was another friend.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:10.960]   We had a bunch of 'em.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.960]   That was her and now she's that.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   She's probably out there tricking
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.120]   to get some of what she needs.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.600]   Our sweet friend at 32, 37, now 38 was a rough year.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.440]   Then we had this dear friend.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.340]   Life got harder and harder for her.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.140]   Wisdom mocked her.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.580]   And then there's one more.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.740]   This sweet thing.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.140]   Between the first arrest and second arrest,
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.820]   was freebasing, got a little burned up,
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.620]   but that didn't stop her 'cause she was addicted
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.580]   and the synapses were there and she had to go back
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.700]   and got busted again after she experienced
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.000]   the horrors of going her way.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.820]   Listen, you guys gotta begin with the end in mind.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.420]   I'm just telling you.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.660]   What you do is you always study the stories
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:51.980]   that are the exception to the rule.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.540]   But you know why they're an exception to the rule?
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.740]   Because there is a rule.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:59.260]   And there's a father up there who's just saying,
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.060]   look, I love you enough to tell you.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.320]   I don't want your destiny to be guilt and shame.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.940]   I want it to be riches, honor, and life.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.020]   And the sooner you can get to it,
[00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.660]   the better it's gonna be for you.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:16.900]   This is what the guy who wrote that book
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.380]   said at the very end of his life.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.380]   And it's one of my favorite places to go.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.300]   We already read in Ecclesiastes.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.540]   I'm gonna go down to chapter 12.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.940]   But Ecclesiastes chapter seven says,
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.820]   "It's better to go to the house of mourning
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.820]   "than the house of feasting
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.100]   "'cause it's the end of every man."
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.420]   I'm telling you guys, you oughta go
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.260]   and you oughta listen to people
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.500]   when they talk about what life was about.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.780]   When lives come to an end, you wanna sit and go,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.140]   what do I want my life to have been?
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.520]   Man, that guy was a party.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.340]   Or do you want it to be that person
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.700]   was a source of good to me?
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.300]   And they kept me from destruction and sorrow.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.740]   They were kind to me and they modeled for me a better way.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.140]   They showed me that there was a better song to listen to.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.540]   They, when everybody else was singing the songs of fool,
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.060]   they lived a life of faith.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.300]   And I saw the blessing in this person's life.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:13.100]   Do you know what the whole book of Ecclesiastes is about?
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.540]   The entire thing is about a guy trying to find life
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.040]   everywhere that he can.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:21.620]   And at the end of his life, when he's tried everything,
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.780]   and the way I can describe the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.340]   is this way, Solomon was the only guy
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.420]   that ran out of mirages before he ran out of money.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.240]   What do I mean?
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.840]   Mirages are appearances that there's life somewhere
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.940]   because of a hallucination,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.340]   because of the way light will play with you
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:36.040]   in certain heated environments
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.340]   where you think that there's gonna be
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.020]   some source of life up here.
[00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:39.860]   And the closer you get to it,
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.340]   you realize it was a mirage, it's not really there.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:47.340]   Solomon chased wine, women, song, power, fame, position.
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   He got it all, and after he chased
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.060]   every single mirage there was,
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.760]   he still had everything he needed.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.540]   He ran the experiment for you.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.620]   He lived it, and now he's gonna say,
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.580]   I've been going everywhere to try and find life.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.420]   I'm going back at the end of my life
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.180]   where I was when I started at the beginning
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.700]   when my father told me that the Lord God
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:09.700]   is a sun and shield.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:12.380]   This is the very end of his life.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.860]   This is the last words of a dying man.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.940]   This is the house of mourning.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.460]   This is what he says, are you ready?
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.140]   Let's tune in.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.480]   He says, "Remember the Creator," watch this,
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.580]   "in the days of your youth."
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:30.640]   It's not have recess, because recess is no fun
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.420]   when you don't live the way you should live.
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.740]   You come back with scars and scabs and sorrow,
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.660]   and you live with bullies,
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.180]   and you're isolated and you're alone.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:46.140]   He's saying life is right here with your teacher
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.280]   and your master and your God.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.140]   He's a good God.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.420]   "Use the days of your youth before the evil days come
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.960]   "and the years draw near when you will say,
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.140]   "I have no delight in them."
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.020]   This is the truth.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:02.620]   I'm gonna just tell you, there's all kinds of people
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.340]   that are gonna have recess, recess, recess,
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.980]   divorce, affair, addiction,
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.900]   and they're gonna make it through,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.420]   and late in their life, they're gonna come to a moment
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.700]   where they go, this was crazy,
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.260]   and someone's gonna talk about the grace of God
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.560]   and they're gonna take it.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.640]   And I believe if they genuinely take it,
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.700]   I think they'll be saved.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.900]   I think much of their life will be wasted.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.480]   But here's what you need to know.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.560]   You have no idea how many of us in this room
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.200]   are gonna make it to be three score or more.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.320]   God offers forgiveness to your repentance.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.680]   He does not promise tomorrow to your procrastination.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.720]   I today stood next to a hole
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.580]   that I put a 17-year-old in today.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:44.920]   And I have no idea where your hole is gonna come,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.640]   but it doesn't matter about where your hole's gonna come.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.840]   You gotta decide when are you gonna grab life.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.520]   When are you gonna want what God wants for you?
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.920]   He's not trying to rip you off.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.320]   He's trying to set you free.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.920]   I'm gonna tell you, by the grace of God,
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   I am one of those strange people
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.120]   that when only the good die young was on,
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.880]   somebody said, let me just tell you, that's a lie.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.520]   The good don't die young.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.120]   People who die to themselves experience life.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.760]   And I started to listen.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.320]   And so from about 1979 on, man,
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.600]   I have been testing this book to see if it is true.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.960]   And I'm here to tell you,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:27.120]   some 40 years later almost,
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   that there has never been a time
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.960]   when I have listened to a loving father
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.360]   who is a son in shield, who gives grace and glory,
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.040]   who no good thing does he deny those who love him.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.840]   There's not been a single time I've listened to him
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.840]   that I've regretted it.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.640]   I've missed out on some incredible enticing opportunities.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.760]   I have missed out on the seductive words of foreign women.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.120]   I've been in those environments.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.320]   I have missed out on numbing myself in the face of pain.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.160]   But you know what else I've done?
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.160]   I've grown to be a man.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.560]   Do you know what happens, by the way,
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.640]   if you learn to numb your pain with meds
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.560]   or with alcohol?
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.520]   Here's what happens.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.560]   You don't grow.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.120]   You don't become the full measure of a person you should be.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.400]   You stunt your maturity because instead of growing up
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.960]   and persevering and becoming the man
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.920]   that God intended to be, you stay stuck as a 17-year-old.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.640]   You stay stuck as a 22-year-old,
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.920]   and you never grow through it
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.520]   because every time there's pain,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.360]   you run and put the pacifier of medication in your life.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.600]   And that is why you see so many immature 30-year-olds
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.360]   and 40-year-olds because they never grew
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.120]   beyond the moment they became addicted.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.000]   Every time I feel sad, every time I feel lonely,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.760]   every time I feel isolated,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.200]   I go and I just click on that button.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.080]   I watch a movie and I imagine I'm in there.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.680]   Instead of learning to be a man,
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.960]   I just keep laying down pathways
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.880]   to what I think is pleasure, but it's not real pleasure.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.960]   You stunt your growth and you stunt your development
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.840]   and you never grow to be the glorious person
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.000]   that God wants you to be.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.720]   Don't go intoxicate yourself.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.360]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.760]   It says don't be drunk with wine for that is dissipation.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.800]   It stunts your growth.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.360]   It makes you less than the man or woman
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.640]   you're supposed to be,
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.440]   but instead be filled with the Spirit.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.560]   And when you're filled with the Spirit,
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.040]   what's gonna happen is there's gonna be more love
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.320]   and goodness and gentleness and kindness
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.240]   and faithfulness and self-control.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.720]   There's gonna be a measure of a man and a godly woman
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.560]   that people are gonna look at and go,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.480]   "Who are you?
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.600]   "Who's your daddy?"
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.200]   And you get to say, "By the grace of God."
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.880]   I gotta tell ya, by the grace of God,
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.520]   it's the kindness of God.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.120]   And I still have a hard time listening to my dad,
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.080]   but he has forgiven me and I'm learning to fear him.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.320]   And what you're seeing in me that is beautiful
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.920]   is 'cause I've been tutored underneath his kindness.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.600]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.840]   Look, guys.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.680]   Look what it says.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.520]   This is Psalm.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.360]   Let's just read it real quickly and we're done.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.200]   He just says this.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.680]   He goes, "Draw near to God."
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.800]   God is the God of the young.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.280]   Can I just say this to you real quick?
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.680]   Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.080]   And then it goes on through and it talks.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.760]   Everybody thinks it's a great psalm to read
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.680]   next to people who are on their deathbed.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.120]   Psalm 23 is not written for old men on their deathbed.
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.960]   It is written for young shepherd boys
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.280]   who are facing bears and lions and giants.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.680]   Psalm 23 is a psalm of a 20-year-old.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.520]   And you gotta figure out, man,
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.840]   God is here to shepherd me through this time
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.640]   when all my insecurities and all my wonders
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.160]   and all my hormones are just firing
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.080]   and all my opportunities before me.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.560]   And instead of wastering it
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.320]   and squandering it on loose living,
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.920]   Psalm 23 is saying, "Come here, man.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.200]   I'm gonna walk you through the valley of the shadow of death
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.240]   when everybody else goes to play
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.040]   and they train themselves to die,
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.640]   I'm gonna train you to be a great daddy, a great mama.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.240]   I'm gonna train you to have a successful marriage.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.400]   I'm gonna train you how to be a glory to God
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   and to your community.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.920]   I'm gonna train you how to be a selfless leader, a warrior."
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.840]   That's Psalm 23.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.880]   And God is calling you in.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.240]   It's not there to read when you're on your deathbed.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.760]   It's there to read when you are starting your life.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.320]   And Solomon wants you to know it.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.160]   He says this, "Don't wait till you're dead.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.360]   Don't wait till you're weak
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.840]   before the sun and the light,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.080]   the moon and the stars are dark."
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.640]   And what he's saying, "Before there's diminished light
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.440]   and hope and there's no hope for tomorrow
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.080]   and the clouds return after the rain."
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.960]   In other words, you're increasingly gloomy
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.360]   because you realize life is about to be over.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.160]   "Don't wait to meet God then.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   He's a God of the young.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:22.360]   In the day that the watchmen of the house tremble."
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.480]   That's the arms and the hands.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.840]   They kind of watch the house like this
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.280]   and they're weak and you're old and you tremble.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:27.800]   "Don't wait till the mighty men stoop."
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.240]   That's, these are the mighty men.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.120]   That's what he's talking about right here.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.200]   "Don't wait till they're weak.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:37.400]   The grinding ones stand idle."
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.280]   Because there are a few, he was talking about,
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.080]   you know, he was talking about your teeth.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.960]   There's not many of them.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.800]   By the way, you want a riddle?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.640]   I'll throw out a riddle for you.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.680]   How do you know that the toothbrush
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.000]   was invented in Kentucky?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.880]   Because if it was invented anywhere else,
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.080]   it'd be called the teeth brush.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.000]   That's why, all right?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.840]   No, okay.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.680]   All right, back to here.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.400]   All right, no, come on.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.440]   If this is broadcast to Kentucky,
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.120]   just pretend I said Arkansas and here we go.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:00.960]   All right, here we go.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.320]   Come on, watch.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.760]   Solomon's saying, "Don't wait till you lose your teeth."
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.080]   All right?
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.200]   Watch.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.200]   He goes on to say,
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.360]   "When those who look through the windows grow dim,"
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.000]   he's talking about your eyes in a very poetic way,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.040]   "and the doors in the street are shut."
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.200]   That's the street of light.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.240]   The lips are shut because you're like this.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.520]   "And the grinding mill is low.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.360]   Your appetite is going away and no one will arise.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.280]   And one will arise at the sound of the bird.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.600]   Early in the morning, sleep is fleeting.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.080]   The daughters of the song will sing softly.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.600]   You can't hear anything.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.800]   Furthermore, at that point in life,
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.360]   men are afraid of high places.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:35.680]   You have a loss of vigor and tears in the road.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.480]   The almond tree blossoms, your hair gets white.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.280]   The grasshopper drags himself along.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.440]   The back is hunched over.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.320]   The caper berry is ineffective."
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.640]   Viagra.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.720]   "For a man goes to eternal home
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.600]   while mourners go to the street.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.680]   Remember before the silver cord is broken,
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.920]   the cord of life, the spinal cord,
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.520]   the golden bowl is crushed.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.920]   The pitcher by the well is shattered.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.760]   The wheel of the cistern, the heart,
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.320]   is not moving like it should.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.480]   And the dust will return to the earth as it was
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.160]   and the spirit will return to God who gave it."
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.120]   Oh, vanity.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.880]   How foolish to live your life apart from a God
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.840]   who wants you to have lived those last 60 years
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.800]   that now as you're sitting there scared,
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.720]   he wants those 60 years to look back on them
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.960]   and go, "Man, I was useful.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.880]   I was loving.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.960]   I was chased.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.040]   I was powerful.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.000]   I wasn't a victim to dogs and liars.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   I tied myself to the master truth
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.040]   and I did not wreck my ship
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.760]   and everybody that was on it with me."
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.880]   Don't you want that life?
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.680]   Then quit listening to the bad advice to treat yourself.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:39.520]   And you learn to come after the one who loves you.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.240]   Folks, that's some good advice.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.520]   I'm here to tell you, I haven't done it perfectly,
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.520]   but every time I've done it, every time I've done it,
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.600]   it's been a blessing.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   I say it almost every time I'm here.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.280]   First John 5:3, "This is the love of God
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.400]   that we keep his commandments
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.600]   and his commandments are not burdensome."
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.040]   Hey guys, I'm gonna tell you,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.720]   man, there's always a backlash out there.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.280]   There's always a moment you wake up
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.160]   and you sober up and you look over and you go,
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.000]   "Oh my gosh."
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.440]   There's always an unwanted something you're dealing with.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.800]   When you walk with God,
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.720]   all your ways are peace.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.120]   It doesn't mean that it's not gonna be trouble,
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.360]   but he's gonna say, "Listen,
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.880]   you're gonna have peace in the midst of trouble
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.680]   because you understand why there's trouble in the world,
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.960]   because people don't tie themselves to the mast of truth.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.320]   And you're gonna run into some of them
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.880]   and they're gonna be cruel to you and mean to you.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.160]   I'm gonna tell you not to yoke with them.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.360]   I'm gonna tell them not to make them your companions,
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.440]   but be a friend to them.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.720]   Friends love at all times.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.040]   Friend, treat them as individuals, not as projects.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.120]   And friends, speak the truth.
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.720]   You be a friend to those people,
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.640]   but you let me be your companion."
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:52.920]   So you want some good advice?
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:57.320]   Get God while you can, not it.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:03.680]   Not some impersonal pronoun that wants to waste you on it.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.400]   You get the lover who gives grace and glory.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.000]   You get God while you can,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.880]   wherever you can and you get all you can.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.680]   You'll never be sated.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.760]   You'll never loathe him.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.400]   You'll learn to love him more and more.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.200]   The beauty of walking with God is the longer you do it,
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.280]   the more you see the sweetness of his way.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.920]   Some of you guys are seeing the bitterness of the other way.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.000]   That's because you're serving a liar.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.600]   And you're not gonna find anybody in this room
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.880]   that's been walking along with God
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.480]   that go, "He gets more and more bitter."
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.120]   They're gonna go, "He gets more and more sweet."
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.040]   And my life gets more and more
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.480]   full of riches and honor in life.
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.080]   And I'm ready for this life to end
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.680]   because it'll get sweeter still,
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:50.120]   where the rest of you are hoping you can hang on
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.000]   and that this bitterness that you're in,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.400]   that this hell on earth will continue
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.160]   because if you're not walking with God,
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.000]   you need to know something.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.120]   This is your heaven.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.920]   So you get all the glory and fun and intoxication you can
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.800]   'cause it's never going to get better than this.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.360]   If you know God and you're walking with him
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.800]   on this earth that isn't as it should be,
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.680]   this is your hell.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:12.440]   It's only gonna get better.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.760]   And while it's here, it's gonna get better
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.280]   'cause he's gonna give you purpose and meaning in life.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.480]   Do you want some of that?
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.200]   Get all the God you can, wherever you can,
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.680]   as much as you can.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.880]   That's some good advice.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.720]   Father, I pray for my friends that they believe it,
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.280]   that they know it, they'd see this true.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.440]   And Lord, I am sure there's some people in this room
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.640]   that right now are hearing from an enemy
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.560]   who wants to lie to them and tell them
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.920]   that maybe because they've listened to liars too long
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.760]   that you wouldn't want them.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.360]   And I pray that they would see you
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.760]   for the kind God that you are.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.960]   I pray that they would see you as the lover that you are,
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.200]   that your toes are at the end of the ranch
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.560]   and you wanna run to them.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.080]   And all it takes is them just saying,
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.840]   but Lord, I have squandered my life on loose living
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.400]   and wine and women or whatever it is.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.600]   I've been that woman, I've been that man
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.280]   that's tried to find life apart from you
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.160]   and I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.480]   And Lord, when they come to you,
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:12.800]   I know they're gonna find grace and forgiveness.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.520]   I know you say you're the God who,
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.880]   even though their sins are red as scarlet,
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.760]   will make 'em white as snow.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.520]   I know that you say that you'll restore the years
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.840]   the locusts have eaten.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.000]   We thank you, Father, that you can even relay tracks.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.880]   You can help our mind not to be conformed to the world,
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.080]   but you can transform us.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.520]   You can bring healing to our mind.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.280]   It's gonna take some diligence, it's gonna take some work,
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:36.040]   but we can start to be people that listen to you.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.080]   And by grace are restored.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.980]   And by faith, we seek you because we know that you're good.
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.320]   And we reject the bad advice that your word's not true,
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.000]   that you don't have our best interest in mind
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.240]   and that disobeying you's not that big a deal.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:54.200]   And we run to you and we fear that we would miss
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.300]   another word because we see your goodness.
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:00.080]   Father, I pray that that story be multiplied in this room
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.720]   and other rooms like this across the country
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.060]   time and time and time again,
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.200]   that we wouldn't stunt our growth and maturity
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.680]   by numbing ourself with fleeting moments
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.440]   of irresponsibility, but we'd be fully alive, fully awake,
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.880]   more deeply in love with you.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.160]   Thank you, Father, that everybody in this room
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.860]   can come to Jesus, be forgiven, and grow,
[00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:26.560]   be healed, to God be the glory.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:32.560]   - That's what we do here at the porch.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.440]   We bless his name.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.920]   We're just telling you the truth.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.360]   When you bless, you speak well.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.240]   That's what the word means.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.920]   We speak well of God's name.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:43.400]   There's so many of us, gang, who have walked,
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.120]   not just in the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.760]   we have been death to ourselves.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.960]   We've invited others into it.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.480]   We've been those mockers.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.280]   And while wisdom does laugh at you, wisdom is not God.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.720]   Wisdom is God's, and that's why he's calling you
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.240]   and standing at the corner of the street saying,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.480]   "Come, come.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.820]   "If you're gonna dwell in the house of the Lord,
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.960]   "you've gotta come to it."
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.520]   And he is here, and the Father whose house you have left
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.680]   is ready to run to you.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.120]   Some of you guys don't think you've walked
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.680]   Some of you guys are out there going, "I'm dead, Todd.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.880]   "If you knew what I did, you wouldn't think
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.720]   "that I could come."
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.640]   No, you need to know something.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   God, I don't care if you're wrapped in grave clothes,
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.600]   he can say to you, "Lazarus, come out."
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.240]   He can call you right now tonight,
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.480]   and he's saying to you, "Come, be healed.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.800]   "Though your sins are red as scarlet,
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.280]   "I can make 'em white as snow."
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.000]   You're not a lost cause.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.480]   You're mine, you're lost.
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.380]   Come, find life in me.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.600]   That's what Jesus says.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.680]   That's what I have found.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.440]   I have listened to the lies that only the good die young.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.800]   You know you're dead.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.520]   Will you let him breathe life into you?
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.160]   Those of you that know that there is life to be found,
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.200]   will you be a friend,
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.080]   and will you be companions to one another
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.200]   as you walk through the valley,
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.240]   the shadow of your 20s?
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.480]   You're not to do it alone.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.120]   You're to do it with other people who sing
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.760]   of the goodness and mercy of God,
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.520]   who remind you that he's kind.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.820]   We know it's hard.
[00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:59.680]   In this world, you're gonna have trouble,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.160]   but take heart, he has overcome this world,
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.600]   and he can overcome your sin,
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.120]   and the scars, and the hard wiring.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.320]   He can transform it, but you've gotta stop
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.220]   putting recipes of death in your bowl.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.760]   He is the God of the young.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.280]   He wants to shepherd you and rescue you.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.200]   Will you come to him?
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.560]   There will be a team here and wherever you are
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.400]   to sit and visit with you.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.960]   Would you come tonight and let us tell you
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.440]   about the goodness and mercy of our God?
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.280]   We love you, Ports.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.140]   We love you, people who are listening.
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.240]   Come and find life with us in the goodness of God.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.080]   Have a great night.
