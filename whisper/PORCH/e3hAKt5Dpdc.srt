1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,200
 - All right, here we go.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,940
 We are finishing up First Comes to Love tonight.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,660
 Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,400
 friends in Houston, aka the pennant winners,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,380
 and all the friends around from Houston.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,220
 I gotta get that out of the way.

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,620
 Astros never go to the World Series.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,460
 All right, hey, tonight we're doing something different.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,640
 We are wrapping up this series.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,560
 Inside of the series, we have covered

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,480
 a number of topics, what love does.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,680
 Ben Stewart kicked us off, we quote,

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,800
 "What love doesn't, what he must be, what she must be."

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,640
 The idea of what God's design for sex was,

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,460
 what to do while you wait, and a lot of the questions

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,720
 that we get any time we do a dating series are,

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,840
 hey, practically, what does it actually look like

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 to date someone?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,600
 And so tonight, it is one thing to talk about it.

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,560
 We are going to show you, and we are gonna take you

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,760
 from the ask-out to the altar and do this tonight.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,980
 We have two volunteers who are gonna be a part of this.

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,000
 Get excited.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,240
 Hopefully, you'll be excited in about 30 minutes

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,320
 once it's done, but our two volunteers

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,760
 are gonna come up right here.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,920
 This is Jacob Huss and Elena Anderson.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,400
 They're gonna come up and model for us.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,840
 They have volunteered to be a part of this.

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,080
 And so Jacob is gonna play Romeo and Juliet,

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
 and they have been gracious enough to volunteer.

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,640
 Elena's actually on our staff, so she didn't have a choice,

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,880
 but they're gonna play the role for us,

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,400
 and we're gonna set the scene real quick,

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,500
 and show you some of what to do

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,480
 and some of what not to do throughout the evening,

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,260
 but the first scene is gonna be the initial ask,

39
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,680
 the asking out.

40
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,100
 And so in this scene, Jacob is gonna show us

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,940
 what not to do.

42
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,620
 He's not gonna text this girl that he's meeting

43
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,560
 for the first time.

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
 Jacob, you can come up here.

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,520
 You can get closer than that.

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,360
 It's okay.

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
 (audience laughing)

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,600
 He's gonna show us what not to do originally.

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,220
 So he's seen this girl.

50
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,120
 Maybe he bumped into her at the porch.

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
 It's porch late night behind us.

52
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
 - We got the scene going.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,960
 - They're the only ones here.

54
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,720
 They're in the Welcome Town Center all by themselves.

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,840
 It's security, but here we go.

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,600
 He's gonna show us what to do or what not to do.

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,440
 So Jacob, here we go.

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,600
 Show us what not to do.

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,000
 - Hey, random porch girl.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,720
 You wanna go on a date?

61
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
 - Okay, let me pause you right there.

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,800
 Hey, we actually have to give this example

63
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,020
 because for whatever reason,

64
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,800
 there could be some gentlemen in this room

65
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,600
 who think we may be still in sixth grade at the mall.

66
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
 Don't go up to a random girl and just say,

67
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,480
 hey, I don't even know your name,

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,040
 but can you give me your number?

69
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,320
 That's not the way to meet.

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,240
 But there is a way to meet,

71
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,520
 where maybe you've been around a social circle

72
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,120
 and you've got to see and observe this girl from afar

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,960
 and you have expressed or taken an interest

74
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,280
 and maybe you've been serving

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,840
 alongside of one another at the porch.

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,480
 And so Jacob's gonna show us maybe in that context

77
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,200
 what it would look like to make the initial ask out.

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,640
 He's gonna use his words.

79
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,080
 He's not gonna text.

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,720
 He's gonna go up and show what that looks like.

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,160
 Jacob, take it away.

82
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,720
 - Hi, Elena.

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,080
 I really enjoyed serving with you at the porch.

84
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,160
 Would you like to get dinner next Tuesday?

85
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
 - No.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,480
 (audience laughing)

87
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,900
 - He's not read these lines too,

88
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,960
 so that's why he's reading them.

89
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,000
 He's been handed these cards.

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,640
 Hey, and Elena, we'll have an option

91
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,960
 to respond with either a yes or a no.

92
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,040
 Both could be valid options

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,200
 depending on the season of life.

94
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,120
 Elena, what do we say to Romeo's inquiry?

95
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,720
 - I would say, sure, that sounds fun.

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,960
 - Man, I love it.

97
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,800
 Just like that.

98
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
 (audience laughing)

99
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,800
 The magic happens.

100
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
 So he's clear.

101
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,840
 He leads out by asking and initiating.

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,320
 Men, ask, initiate.

103
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,500
 A lot of the questions that we get is,

104
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,440
 is it okay for a girl to ask out a guy?

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,240
 Maybe, I don't know.

106
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,440
 I mean, here's what, here's what Biblically,

107
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
 God created the world we're told

108
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 and there was certain order and design that he put into it.

109
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,920
 One of the ways that he ordered the world

110
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
 is that when it came to creation of man and woman,

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,600
 he set a design for men to lead and to initiate,

112
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,320
 to be the servant leaders.

113
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,280
 And part of the ways that they serve and they initiate

114
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,120
 is by being the ones who ask out.

115
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
 Is it wrong for a girl?

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I don't know, but here's what I do think it does,

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,460
 is it breeds passivity if the girl, from moment one,

118
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,480
 it breeds passivity in the man

119
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,120
 if she's the one driving and leading the relationship.

120
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,040
 So it just may not be wise,

121
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,000
 though, I don't know, maybe it's okay.

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
 Dating went around and the Bible's written,

123
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
 but we don't think it's wise or God's best.

124
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,040
 So here we go, Jacob leads, he initiates,

125
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
 is in line with Ephesians five,

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,000
 and the date is begun.

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,400
 All right, so here we go, fast forward seven days,

128
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,280
 here we are, they're at the date,

129
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,360
 you guys can head back to the date, seven days go by.

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,560
 We're at a romantic dinner.

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,280
 Maybe, maybe not quite as romantic, Billy.

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
 Mexican, I love it.

133
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,880
 All right, here we are,

134
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,160
 sitting down, enjoying some chips

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
 and a candle that won't light.

136
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
 And here's what we're gonna show here.

137
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
 Oftentimes, man, this is, you gotta listen to me here,

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,240
 this happens more often, what I'm about to explain

139
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
 happens more often than you would think,

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,480
 where guys will be overly intense

141
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,400
 and attempt to be intentional,

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,840
 especially, man, some of the porch men,

143
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,200
 I love you, but we can be the worst at it,

144
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,240
 where it will be like, hey, I'm gonna regurgitate

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
 a lot of what I heard of the porch

146
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,400
 and just kind of go into Christianese

147
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,080
 is the only thing that I speak at this moment.

148
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,760
 And so the idea is to be intentional,

149
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,440
 but not overly intense.

150
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,800
 So Jacob's gonna show us a little bit,

151
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,360
 what do I mean by overly intense?

152
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,680
 Jacob, take it away.

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,680
 You just read the card.

154
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,600
 - Elena, I just really want you to know that,

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,480
 really just one thing, I'm here to get married.

156
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,480
 And truly, I think that you are the one,

157
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,080
 the one that I'm looking for.

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,200
 I know there's no the one, whatever that is,

159
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,560
 and that I could marry, that I could make marriage work

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
 with any one of the millions of godly single women around.

161
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,340
 But out of that group, I think you could be the one person

162
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,440
 that God has for me to spend my life with on earth.

163
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,320
 Because we all know people aren't married in heaven.

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,280
 We're on the same page on that, right?

165
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
 Also,

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,240
 and just out of curiosity,

167
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
 how many children do you wanna have?

168
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:33,340
 - Okay, this is not okay on date one or date 50.

169
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,400
 This is not the way that you wanna

170
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,440
 initiate the conversation.

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,800
 It's overly intense.

172
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,880
 Don't go into how many children you wanna have

173
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
 or anything of that sort.

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,600
 Just making conversational, it's relaxed conversation.

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
 Hey, where are you from?

176
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,340
 How many siblings do you have?

177
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,520
 What are their ages?

178
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,360
 Where do you work?

179
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
 What's your favorite part of your job?

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
 You don't have to do an interview.

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And it's not just bombarding and not letting them talk,

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,180
 but it's just making relaxed conversation,

183
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,960
 not being intense, but being intentional.

184
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,440
 The Bible says Christians, in Colossians chapter four,

185
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,880
 verse six, are to be those whose speech

186
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,400
 is full of grace seasoned with salt.

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,400
 Salt being like, man, it's appealing, it's appetizing.

188
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,960
 I wanna hear more of that.

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,440
 And so one of the ways that you can do this

190
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,600
 in a dating context is by not being overly intense,

191
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,240
 but being intentional.

192
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
 So here they are, the date went well,

193
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,200
 things wrapped up, they had good conversation,

194
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,520
 and it's over.

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
 So they head home.

196
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,920
 They head back to their respective apartments,

197
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,560
 wherever they live in this made up world.

198
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,280
 And they head there and Jacob decides,

199
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,160
 man, I would really like to take this girl

200
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,600
 on a second date.

201
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,120
 So he heads back to his room, he's sitting there,

202
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,880
 he's talking with his buddies,

203
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
 he decides I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna call and ask.

204
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,820
 And Elena's gonna show us how to respond.

205
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,820
 So here we are in Jacob's room with a giant bean bag

206
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:59,880
 and Picasso's boxes everywhere, and he's playing Xbox.

207
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,980
 And he's hanging over here, he's decided,

208
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,600
 I wanna ask Elena on a date.

209
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,320
 Elena's gonna show us how to respond,

210
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
 'cause sometimes maybe you don't wanna go on a second date,

211
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,760
 maybe you do, how do you respond in those situations?

212
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,520
 Elena's over here, she's got her Pottery Barn mattress top

213
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,800
 or whatever this is, and she's hanging out,

214
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,480
 and Jacob all of a sudden calls.

215
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,460
 Jacob, pick up that phone.

216
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,580
 Just hanging out in your apartment with your pastor.

217
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,580
 (audience laughing)

218
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,880
 - Oh, that's for me.

219
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 (audience laughing)

220
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,560
 - Hey, Elena?

221
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,400
 - Hello?

222
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
 - Hey, I just wanna let you know

223
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,520
 that I had a great time with you

224
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,800
 and would love to take you on a second date.

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,200
 Do you have plans this Friday night?

226
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
 - Okay, let me pause.

227
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,640
 What do you do, sometimes it's, hey, yes,

228
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,480
 but what do you do?

229
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,520
 Sometimes you don't wanna go on a second date.

230
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,040
 It was fun, it was whatever it was,

231
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,760
 but you're not really interested in moving forward

232
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
 and you don't wanna have a second date.

233
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
 Elena's gonna show us what you don't do.

234
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,720
 - Okay.

235
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
 - Jacob, can you hit repeat?

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
 Call one more time.

237
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,520
 Phone got dropped, or the signal dropped.

238
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,800
 - Hello?

239
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,640
 - Hey, Elena.

240
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,840
 (audience laughing)

241
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,080
 - Hi.

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,200
 - Hey, hey, I was just calling.

243
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
 I just wanted to let you know

244
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,640
 that I really had a great time with you last week

245
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,840
 and I'd love to take you on a second date.

246
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,160
 Do you have plans this Friday night?

247
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,640
 - I actually do.

248
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,520
 - Well, what about Saturday night

249
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,120
 or maybe even next Friday night?

250
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,040
 - I actually have plans for the next five years.

251
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,960
 And I think I'm gonna be called to be a nun, so.

252
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,800
 My self-service is kinda sadic-y, gotta go, bye.

253
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,840
 - Hello?

254
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,440
 No, that is not what you do

255
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,920
 if you wanna go on a second date.

256
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,320
 You tell the truth.

257
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,640
 You don't blame it on God.

258
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,480
 You don't blame it on your community group.

259
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,720
 You say the truth.

260
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,960
 Hey, I'm not interested at this time

261
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,880
 in going on a second date.

262
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
 We're Christians.

263
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
 Ephesians chapter four, verse 15 says,

264
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
 "Christians don't lie.

265
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,520
 "They speak the truth to one another in love."

266
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,720
 If you're not interested in going on a second date,

267
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,240
 you say that.

268
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,280
 But let's say they were to go on a second date.

269
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,000
 Maybe she was interested and she said yes.

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,560
 She didn't say no at that time.

271
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,960
 And so they go on a second date, things are going well.

272
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,400
 Maybe they went to the fair together.

273
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,520
 Nope, they didn't go to the fair.

274
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,640
 Here they are.

275
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,000
 Just at the ice cream shop with no feet.

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,920
 And they're having a great time.

277
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
 And all of a sudden, there are a few dates in

278
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
 and they've entered into the relationship zone.

279
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
 And by the relationship zone, I mean this kinda,

280
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
 hey, where's this going?

281
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,560
 Where the friends are starting to go,

282
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,880
 what's up with you guys?

283
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,660
 And they've all of a sudden gotten to this place

284
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,080
 where Jacob, as the male, needs to remove confusion

285
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,800
 and do what has been called historically a DTR,

286
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
 a defining of the relationship.

287
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,080
 So they're gonna have this moment where Jacob bleeds out

288
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,960
 and he removes confusion as the guy is supposed to do

289
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,360
 and give clarity on his intentions

290
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
 or where he sees it going

291
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,320
 or maybe where he doesn't see it going.

292
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,720
 And so oftentimes this will happen at night in a car.

293
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
 You get done with the date

294
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,520
 or you get done hanging out at the ice cream shop

295
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,840
 and Jacob's gonna show us what to do

296
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,720
 and what this looks like.

297
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
 So here we are, we're hanging out in the car.

298
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,120
 Just, he opens the car door.

299
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,120
 (audience cheering)

300
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,200
 That's just free.

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,160
 Just.

302
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,440
 In the car with your pastor again.

303
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,560
 All right, Jacob.

304
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 So what does it look like to remove any confusion?

305
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,960
 Is that music?

306
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,360
 Can we turn the radio down here?

307
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,400
 And some air in the back, it's a little hot.

308
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
 And Jacob, let's remove a little confusion

309
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,760
 on what it looks like and help define this relationship.

310
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,120
 - So Elena, I would love to continue this relationship

311
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,080
 and continue to take you on dates

312
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,720
 and pursue you as my girlfriend.

313
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,080
 (audience laughing)

314
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
 - I'm not sure we read the line.

315
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,720
 - I would like that, Jacob.

316
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,560
 - Oh, you would? - Yes.

317
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
 - Okay, well, I guess that's a W.

318
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,480
 That was good, it felt a little stiff and a little,

319
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,200
 guys, I wouldn't write that down in the room.

320
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,760
 You may wanna have some emotion attached to that idea

321
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,880
 of asking a girl to be your girlfriend in the future.

322
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,600
 But you wanna do everything that you can

323
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,400
 to remove confusion.

324
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,760
 If there's any mystery, if they're wondering,

325
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,800
 it is a failure on us as guys, as we're leading.

326
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,440
 So whatever we can do to just telegraph,

327
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
 hey, this is where I am, this is where I see us going.

328
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,920
 I'm not saying we're getting married,

329
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,720
 I just wanna continue to make this relationship deepen

330
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,280
 and exclusively pursue you.

331
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,760
 Are you okay with that?

332
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,480
 And so do that in your own words,

333
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,880
 but bring as much clarity as you can.

334
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
 Here's why I think this is so crucial.

335
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,840
 'Cause we grew up, I grew up just like you,

336
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,760
 in a culture that says, hey,

337
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,560
 you wanna leave a little mystery.

338
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,000
 You don't wanna just put it all out there.

339
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,920
 You wanna leave 'em wondering a little bit.

340
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,080
 If they text, don't respond too fast.

341
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,840
 You don't wanna be seen as that person.

342
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,720
 Leave a little mystery.

343
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,480
 And the Bible says that as followers of Christ,

344
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
 particularly as a man leading,

345
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,000
 we are not to leave a little mystery.

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,360
 That leaders remove confusion.

347
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,320
 That the reason we leave mystery

348
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,040
 is 'cause we're kind of afraid of rejection,

349
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
 we're playing the game.

350
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,880
 And it's not loving.

351
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,000
 It's not serving, and it's not loving.

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
 And it's honestly selfish.

353
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,600
 And it's self-seeking.

354
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,720
 And so the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 13

355
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,800
 that, hey, love, by definition,

356
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,080
 is not self-seeking or self-preserving.

357
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,040
 And so you cannot be self-preserving and be loving.

358
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,160
 And so as men, it's incumbent on us

359
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,320
 to define the relationship, define where it's going,

360
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,160
 and bring as much clarity to it as we can.

361
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,480
 And set expectations.

362
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,120
 Communicate early and often.

363
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,520
 Okay, so here we are.

364
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,760
 They've become boyfriend and girlfriend.

365
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,200
 They are in like, if you will.

366
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,920
 And they find themselves, you know, a few months in maybe,

367
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,760
 and where oftentimes people can find themselves,

368
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,480
 maybe one of them thinks, man, I think we should break up.

369
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,320
 And so what do you do?

370
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,600
 Do you just go submarineing,

371
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,960
 which is the term that I heard this week,

372
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
 where you just disappear

373
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,800
 and then all of a sudden resurface at some time?

374
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,560
 Do you just totally, that's pretty genius, actually.

375
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,560
 Do you text them and say, it's over, sorry, emoji.

376
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,640
 And what do you do?

377
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,880
 And so Elena's gonna show us what to do,

378
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,000
 which is in person, she's gonna go to them.

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,280
 Elena has processed with her community.

380
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,200
 She's prayed through it.

381
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,440
 She just doesn't see the relationship going forward.

382
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,240
 She thinks Jacob's a great guy,

383
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,560
 but in this scenario, she thinks,

384
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,600
 man, I don't think this is right.

385
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,160
 So Elena, show us what this would look like.

386
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,040
 Jacob, we're gonna need you over there.

387
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,520
 - Jacob, I am thankful for the way

388
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,840
 that you have led me these past few months,

389
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,120
 but I've been praying and processing with community

390
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,440
 and I can't continue in this relationship.

391
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,680
 Thank you for leading me in a godly way.

392
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,680
 - Okay, that felt a little more chipper.

393
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,280
 Maybe you wanna be in the breakup,

394
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,320
 but let's pretend that her heart was in that

395
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,800
 and she was kindly and gently trying to communicate this.

396
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,720
 So Jacob, I apologize for all the heartbreak

397
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,560
 and you were a little too happy in that moment.

398
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,640
 But you wanna communicate that you're honest.

399
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,880
 You don't blame it on God.

400
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
 You don't say, it's not you, it's me.

401
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,320
 You don't just make something up.

402
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
 You just tell the truth.

403
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,760
 You express what's true.

404
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,920
 Hey, I don't see this going forward at this time.

405
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,280
 It doesn't mean the relationship is over forever

406
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,880
 and ever and ever, but you can just be honest

407
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,720
 and say, hey, I don't think it makes sense

408
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,640
 for us to continue dating and moving forward at this time.

409
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,840
 You do it in person.

410
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,120
 You're considerate of the other person involved.

411
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,960
 You seek to leave them better than you found them

412
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,920
 throughout the entire thing.

413
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,360
 Matthew 7, Jesus says the golden rule

414
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,800
 is that you treat other people

415
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,480
 as you wish they would treat you.

416
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,400
 You treat other people as you wanna be treated.

417
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
 And he says that the entire Bible

418
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,960
 is summed up in that verse.

419
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,180
 And so even when we break up,

420
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,720
 we do so gently, caring about the other person

421
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
 or considerate with kindness as best we can,

422
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,080
 and we communicate the truth and speak in love.

423
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,160
 But let's say they didn't break up.

424
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,440
 So it just got really dark in here.

425
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,960
 So the relationship continues going forward.

426
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,120
 And it's early enough to where Jacob decides,

427
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,600
 man, I wanna honor her family.

428
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,860
 I wanna honor her father.

429
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,080
 I wanna express to them, even him, if I get a chance,

430
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,060
 hey, here's my intentions for dating your daughter,

431
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,640
 and he's gonna have a chance to do that.

432
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,720
 So Jacob has found himself at, he goes over,

433
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,160
 he initiates to set up a time

434
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,040
 to meet with Elena's father.

435
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,040
 So Elena exits the scene, and here, Jacob,

436
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,420
 you're at the house, just go ahead and knock on that door

437
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,620
 or ring the doorbell, whichever one.

438
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,980
 (knocking)

439
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,800
 (doorbell rings)

440
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,860
 (audience laughing)

441
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,700
 Hey, Jacob.

442
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,700
 (audience cheering)

443
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:29,900
 Good to meet you.

444
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,720
 - Good to meet you, sir.

445
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
 - I was just cleaning my gun.

446
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,660
 (audience laughing)

447
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,380
 - It's sometimes, her dad is Rambo,

448
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,220
 and in a white beater with a shotgun.

449
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,460
 - Excuse me while I put his shirt on.

450
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,860
 - Is dad's mic on?

451
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,380
 All right, let's make sure that, all right.

452
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,420
 - So there they are.

453
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,020
 - 'Cause I'm saying some brilliant stuff.

454
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,180
 - I know you are, okay.

455
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,020
 Hey, get that shirt, buddy.

456
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,860
 - He's addressed, okay.

457
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,680
 - It's church behavior.

458
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,520
 - Can you sit down?

459
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,360
 - Please, have a seat.

460
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,180
 - Hey, you guys, sit down.

461
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,380
 - Why aren't you sitting already?

462
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,380
 (audience laughing)

463
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,040
 What do you want?

464
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,100
 (audience laughing)

465
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,180
 - So really, I just wanted to thank you

466
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,900
 for taking your time to meet with me,

467
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,780
 and I know you're a busy guy,

468
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,700
 and really just wanted to tell you that,

469
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,980
 you know, I just wanted to talk to you

470
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,320
 because I've really enjoyed dating your daughter, Elena.

471
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,100
 - Good.

472
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,100
 (audience laughing)

473
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,820
 - Yeah, and you know, the thing is, she's just really hot.

474
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
 (audience laughing)

475
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,400
 - Come again.

476
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,560
 - So this took a turn.

477
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,100
 (audience laughing)

478
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,260
 Mr. Anderson.

479
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,420
 - Yeah, let's, why don't we try that again?

480
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,260
 - Okay.

481
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,100
 - We should try that again.

482
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,920
 - Action.

483
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,820
 - Mr. Anderson, thank you so much for having me over,

484
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,620
 and really, I just came and wanted to thank you

485
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,600
 for raising such an amazing daughter,

486
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,340
 and I want you to know that I'm not wasting her time,

487
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,800
 and truly, my intentions are to date her with purity,

488
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,220
 and I wanted to give you my phone number

489
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,100
 in case you have any questions at all

490
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,140
 about our relationship.

491
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,380
 - Yeah, man, well, I appreciate that.

492
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,100
 - Absolutely, thank you.

493
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,140
 (audience applauding)

494
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,060
 - Nicely done.

495
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,980
 Okay, so hey, is there a verse that commands this?

496
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,780
 Yes, the Bible says that you and I

497
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,100
 are to honor our father and mother,

498
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,780
 and so out of that principle,

499
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,820
 what you're doing in this scenario

500
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
 is honoring her father and your mother.

501
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,860
 You may be going, wait a second,

502
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,380
 but the Bible doesn't say you have to go ask her father

503
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,560
 in order to date her.

504
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,700
 In biblical times, you wouldn't need to command that

505
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,300
 because it was a law.

506
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,700
 You had to speak to the father

507
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,500
 in order to become the main male figure or guy in her life,

508
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,460
 and so all this is doing is you are establishing early on

509
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,900
 and modeling what it looks like to lead really well.

510
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,460
 What if her father's not a believer?

511
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,420
 Is it still relevant to do this?

512
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,860
 Yes.

513
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,400
 It is showcasing how your faith informs

514
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,260
 the way that you date, live, everything.

515
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,700
 So you're showing how Jesus impacts all of that,

516
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,840
 and you're being, honestly, a light to even that father.

517
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,140
 So Jacob did a great job of this.

518
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,780
 The relationship continues.

519
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,460
 They go through merge,

520
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,020
 watermarks premarital ministry.

521
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,100
 Things continue to just develop.

522
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,980
 They are very much alike at this point.

523
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,540
 He decides, man, I wanna move towards marriage.

524
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,840
 My community is celebrating this relationship.

525
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,580
 Other people in our life look at this thing,

526
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,380
 and they're like, man, that's a good thing,

527
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,700
 and so everywhere that I look,

528
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,020
 it seems like green light, green light,

529
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,660
 and I wanna move towards this woman

530
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,180
 being not just someone I'm dating,

531
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,720
 but someone I wanna spend the rest of my life with.

532
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,980
 So he decides, I'm gonna ask for her hand in marriage.

533
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,140
 Fast forward six months, here we are.

534
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,540
 They're at the golf range,

535
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,060
 playing golf with possible father-in-law.

536
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,100
 - So Jacob, how's the relationship going?

537
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,980
 - Well, Mr. Anderson, things are going well,

538
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,100
 and I've really enjoyed spending time with your daughter.

539
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,940
 - Good.

540
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,020
 (audience laughing)

541
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,460
 - And really, the reason I initiated golf with you today

542
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,220
 was I had a question for you.

543
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,600
 And so, Mr. Anderson, that question was,

544
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,540
 I'd like to ask your permission and blessing

545
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,860
 to ask Elena to become my wife.

546
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,700
 - That's interesting.

547
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,100
 (audience laughing)

548
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,900
 I need to switch clubs.

549
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
 (audience laughing)

550
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,980
 I'm just kidding, buddy.

551
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,340
 Hey, welcome to the family.

552
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,340
 (audience laughing)

553
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:40,260
 Oh, man, what are they, father-in-law?

554
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,580
 All right, so they get engaged,

555
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,980
 or they're about to get engaged.

556
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,380
 And he's decided, man, I'm gonna propose.

557
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,460
 So he buys a ring, plans it all out.

558
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,820
 He plans something that he believes

559
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,620
 that his girlfriend, hopefully fiancee, would like.

560
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,240
 That's just free, men.

561
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,080
 You're gonna wanna make sure

562
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,580
 if she's not a jumbotron kind of girl,

563
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,820
 you don't do the jumbotron.

564
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,940
 And so he plans it all out, he thinks through it.

565
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,460
 Probably he's gonna contact her friends and family,

566
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,980
 maybe to be a part of it.

567
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,860
 Head to some place that's sentimental to both of them.

568
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,620
 And he's gonna ask her to be his wife.

569
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,660
 So here we are, all alone on this page.

570
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,460
 (audience laughing)

571
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,580
 Anytime, guys.

572
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,940
 And apparently there's trouble in paradise

573
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,060
 that I didn't realize.

574
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,740
 And he's gonna ask her to be his wife.

575
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,580
 Jacob?

576
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,540
 (audience laughing)

577
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,380
 Are you pacing?

578
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,620
 Elena?

579
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:40,220
 Okay, all right.

580
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
 - This is weird.

581
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,060
 (audience laughing)

582
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,900
 - Did you just spray on cologne back there?

583
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,860
 Just a little bit.

584
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,700
 One spray, one spray.

585
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,540
 We'll run it back.

586
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,300
 (Elena laughing)

587
00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:00,060
 Elena, but really, I just.

588
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,060
 (audience laughing)

589
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,380
 Guys, we keep moving over here, we gotta come back.

590
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,380
 (audience laughing)

591
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:20,100
 Elena, I just cannot imagine life without you.

592
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,260
 And-- - Okay.

593
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,860
 - Have you seen any romantic movies?

594
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
 Get on a knee.

595
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,460
 (audience laughing)

596
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,980
 Hashtag drop the knees.

597
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
 (audience laughing)

598
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,220
 Elena, I just cannot imagine life without you.

599
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,900
 And I want to serve you for the rest of my life.

600
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,820
 Will you marry me?

601
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,260
 Wait, okay, now you're supposed to do the girl thing.

602
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,700
 You know, the (laughing)

603
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,700
 (audience laughing)

604
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,900
 - Yes, I would love to marry you.

605
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,860
 (audience laughing)

606
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,460
 - Okay, it's just a skit, okay.

607
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:03,100
 I apologize.

608
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,100
 They're married, they've been married for six months.

609
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,020
 It's legal to kiss on stage.

610
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,620
 (audience laughing)

611
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,580
 Hey, give it up for our volunteers

612
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,620
 who took us from the ask out to the altar.

613
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,420
 JP's gonna come back up, Father JP,

614
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,100
 and shut us down tonight.

615
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,860
 (audience laughing)

616
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,580
 Actually, he's cleaning the gun.

617
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,420
 Oh, there you are.

618
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,420
 (laughing)

619
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,660
 - How we doing, guys?

620
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,980
 Hey, is that fun or what?

621
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,820
 We learn anything?

622
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,860
 (audience cheering)

623
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,340
 Hey, here's the deal.

624
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,020
 The reason we do that is as JP, as David,

625
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,660
 David is his name, as David said up front,

626
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,660
 you know, the number one thing that we get asked is,

627
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,580
 "Hey, can you make it practical?"

628
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,540
 Like, show us what it looks like.

629
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,460
 And can you explain it to us in images?

630
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,860
 And I love that because that's what Jesus would do.

631
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,620
 You think about the Sermon on the Mount, right?

632
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,700
 He would say, "Look at the birds.

633
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,380
 "The birds are flying by."

634
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,860
 And he would teach through imagery so much so,

635
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,140
 I think more than you would ever imagine,

636
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,980
 this idea of marriage and relationships,

637
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,820
 it's all about him.

638
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,820
 And I want you to hang in there with me for a moment, okay?

639
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,300
 I want you to think about this.

640
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
 I want you to travel back with me to about 300 BC.

641
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,820
 So about 300 years before Christ.

642
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,340
 Let me kind of explain some traditions to you.

643
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,700
 There'd be a young Jewish boy, a Hebrew child.

644
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,260
 He would grow up in his father's home

645
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,180
 until he hit the adult age

646
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,060
 and it was time to go look for a wife.

647
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,100
 What he would do is he would leave his father's house

648
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,140
 and he would go to a foreign land looking for a partner

649
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,620
 to spend the rest of his life with.

650
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,900
 And he would begin to ask people

651
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,060
 to find out who had a reputable reputation,

652
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,060
 who was someone that would make an incredible helper to him.

653
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,860
 And when he would find her,

654
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,860
 then his father would come and pay what was called a dowry.

655
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,580
 It literally was like a down payment, if you will.

656
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,580
 It was a ton of money to step into a legal agreement,

657
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,620
 not illegal, but a legal agreement.

658
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,100
 So not just an engagement,

659
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,940
 but a legal binding agreement with her.

660
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,940
 And then what would happen is the two would make a toast.

661
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,180
 And the reason I tell you this

662
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,620
 is because this is where our traditions come from today.

663
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,860
 The reason you do a wedding toast

664
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,380
 dates back to biblical ideas and Jewish traditions.

665
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,660
 And so they would drink from the same cup.

666
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,580
 And at that time, those two were bound together,

667
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,300
 but they were not married.

668
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,760
 And so what he would do then

669
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,940
 is he would go back to his land.

670
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,940
 He would go back to his father's home.

671
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,740
 And because that was his home

672
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,820
 and inheritance was everything at that time,

673
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,980
 he would begin to build a room for them

674
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,980
 on his father's house.

675
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,420
 And so he would spend the next year or so

676
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,520
 building a room for them.

677
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,360
 Where was she?

678
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,260
 She was back in her land making preparations.

679
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,460
 She was gathering a group of women.

680
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,520
 Listen, you know where we get the tradition bridesmaids?

681
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,240
 It comes from this.

682
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,920
 She would gather a group of women.

683
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,080
 And at that time, it wasn't just to like,

684
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,800
 you know, stand up there with you.

685
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,960
 You would actually do something.

686
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,440
 You would begin to make her dress.

687
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,040
 You would begin to help her prepare

688
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,000
 for a lifetime of marriage.

689
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
 And then when that Hebrew child was done making that room,

690
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,700
 that girl would have no idea the time or the hour.

691
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,500
 All right?

692
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,520
 And he would leave his father's house now

693
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,160
 with the room prepared for them.

694
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,280
 And he would go back

695
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,980
 and he would send some men ahead of them.

696
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,960
 You want to know where we get the tradition groomsmen?

697
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,420
 These guys would travel ahead of him

698
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,380
 as he goes back for his bride to take her home,

699
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,820
 to be his wife.

700
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,360
 And they would say, "He's coming.

701
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,440
 "Your groom is coming for you."

702
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,400
 And sometimes they would blast trumpets

703
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,440
 and the sound would travel ahead of them from town to town.

704
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,760
 It would move ahead of them.

705
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,800
 "Oh, a groom is coming.

706
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,480
 "Hey, pass it on to the next town.

707
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,020
 "A groom is coming for his wife.

708
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,980
 "This is her name.

709
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,220
 "Go and tell her."

710
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,420
 And then when her bridesmaids would catch word,

711
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,480
 there was, "He's coming.

712
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
 "He's coming for you."

713
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,320
 And they would get all excited and do that thing,

714
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,240
 you know, they do.

715
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,800
 And then she would get ready.

716
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,080
 She would put on that dress

717
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,600
 and she would prepare herself for her groom-to-be

718
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,920
 to come and take her.

719
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,960
 And he would.

720
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,400
 And he'd take her home.

721
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,040
 But what was waiting for them there was a party,

722
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,360
 a celebration.

723
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,840
 And they would go, and this is where it gets PG-13.

724
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,080
 They would go into the bridal chamber

725
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,480
 or that room that he prepared,

726
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,180
 and they would be in there for seven days.

727
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:57,480
 Seven days, sealing the marriage.

728
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,760
 And she was veiled.

729
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,000
 No one had seen her yet.

730
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
 And there's a party outside.

731
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,360
 Now, consider how awkward that is.

732
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,920
 Everybody's just partying outside for seven days.

733
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,880
 Guys, this is where we get a seven-day honeymoon.

734
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,200
 These traditions are entrenched.

735
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,600
 Deep, deep, deep traditions.

736
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
 Where do you think they come from?

737
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
 And then she would come out

738
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,200
 and he would present her to his family

739
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,160
 for the very first time.

740
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,960
 "This is my bride."

741
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,620
 Now, consider what Jesus says.

742
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:37,000
 He's talking to Thomas.

743
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
 Even before that, consider what it says

744
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,560
 in the scriptures, that he's gonna come,

745
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:46,000
 the hour, the date, the time, that is not aware.

746
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,600
 We're not, we don't know.

747
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,040
 With a trumpet blast, he's gonna show up.

748
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
 But if you consider what he says to Thomas,

749
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,680
 he says, "Hey, we don't know the way."

750
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,360
 Thomas says, "Jesus, we don't know the way."

751
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
 He says, "You do know the way."

752
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,480
 It's John 14.

753
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,760
 He says, "You do know the way.

754
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,640
 "I've told you, if it were not so.

755
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,760
 "See, my Father's house has many rooms.

756
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,600
 "I go to prepare a place for you.

757
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,280
 "I go there to prepare a place for you."

758
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,640
 And then we see the time and the hour

759
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,000
 is not known to us, that he's going to come back for us.

760
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,080
 Don't you see this life and this world

761
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,080
 and your existence and the fact that your heart beats

762
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,960
 in your chest and you have breath in your lungs

763
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,080
 is about so much more than an earthly relationship.

764
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,360
 I did a wedding two weeks ago

765
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,480
 and that groom was up there.

766
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,280
 And I watch him, right, before those doors open in the back.

767
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,480
 The groomsmen have come down and he's there

768
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,960
 and I'm standing there and the whole place

769
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,120
 is filled with hope.

770
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,800
 You know, the mother is about to stand to her feet

771
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,720
 and the whole place is filled with hope.

772
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,840
 And I'm watching him because his eyes

773
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,160
 are glued on that back door and it's about to swing open

774
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,500
 and he doesn't know when.

775
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,040
 And he's about to see his bride for the first time

776
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,160
 on that day and she's been preparing herself.

777
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,640
 And it always, when the doors swing open, man,

778
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,420
 I watch them, they can't hold it together

779
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,360
 no matter how big and how strong and, you know,

780
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,440
 how macho and even if they hadn't cried in 10 years.

781
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,800
 And she's like, that lip starts to quiver,

782
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,880
 starts to do that thing.

783
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
 I watch him and she walks down the aisle

784
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,480
 and she just, ear to ear.

785
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,120
 And that's our job.

786
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,040
 That's what you're doing right now.

787
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,920
 You didn't even know it.

788
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,760
 Right now, you're waiting for the sky to crack open

789
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,140
 and roll back like a scroll.

790
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,960
 And your bridegroom, he's coming on a white horse

791
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,140
 and he's returning for you.

792
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,640
 And he's gonna take you home to his father's house.

793
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,920
 He's gonna take you home to his father's house.

794
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,440
 And not just that, but he's gonna present you pure and holy

795
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,000
 like a spotless virgin, clean.

796
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,200
 And you think, but I'm not clean.

797
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,160
 That's what he does.

798
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,680
 That's his job description.

799
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,080
 He makes you clean.

800
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,160
 He takes all the stuff you've been involved in,

801
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,840
 all the thoughts you've had and the things

802
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,480
 that have happened to you and the things

803
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,680
 you've been a part of and he cleans you up

804
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,080
 and he presents you in his father's court, pure and holy.

805
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,880
 What a humbling thing.

806
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,700
 Pure and holy, spotless, his bride.

807
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,380
 And so all the pleasure that you think of

808
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,840
 that you've been waiting for,

809
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,400
 or maybe you've experienced in a really cheap form,

810
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,360
 through intimacy, that's a metaphor.

811
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,000
 Like God made us.

812
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,080
 That's like heaven all the time, expounded upon.

813
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,620
 It's us in the bridegroom, Jesus.

814
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,560
 And so you don't need to get married

815
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,080
 to learn more about God, but you can understand

816
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,900
 that he's given us relationships

817
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,080
 to teach us something about him.

818
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,520
 And that's why we've been talking about,

819
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,400
 when we say first comes love, it's absolutely true.

820
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,760
 He loved you first.

821
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,240
 First comes love indeed.

822
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,160
 So what is our right response, yours and mine?

823
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,000
 It's to worship.

824
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,760
 So that's what we're gonna do now.

825
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,120
 We're gonna worship.

826
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,320
 So Father, we love you and we thank you

827
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,560
 for the gift of relationships.

828
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,400
 We thank you that while we were yet sinners,

829
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,280
 you sent your son here.

830
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,000
 And we thank you that he didn't just stay here,

831
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,640
 but he went home to prepare a place for us

832
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,040
 in your house.

833
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,340
 In your courts, we will live forever.

834
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,360
 We will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

835
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,520
 Forever and ever and ever.

836
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,000
 Father, now as we sing to you,

837
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,940
 would you renew our hearts and minds around that reality?

838
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,600
 That we get to be with you forever.

839
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,600
 God, thank you for laughter.

840
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,840
 And thank you for simple truths.

841
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,360
 And thank you for biblical ideas

842
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,760
 that you didn't leave us here just to flounder.

843
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,280
 And God, for those of us that we hear all of that

844
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,640
 and we just feel like, man, we have no one to apply it with.

845
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,860
 God, would you fill our hearts with hope, with Jesus,

846
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,560
 that we're gonna be with you forever and ever and ever

847
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,400
 and ever.

848
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,680
 Would you make that enough for us today?

849
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,640
 Please, God.

850
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:50,160
 In the name of Christ, your son, amen.

851
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,520
