1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,740
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,800
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,300
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,280
 (upbeat music)

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,780
 (upbeat music)

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,240
 - All right, well, my name is David.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,960
 If it is your first time, like Shane said, welcome.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,840
 I know JP and several of us have welcomed.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
 We're so glad that you're here tonight.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,640
 We're finishing up the Sermon on the Mount.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,720
 So friends of Fort Worth, welcome for joining us

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,920
 or welcome joining us as well.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,220
 And tonight we'll finish up the Summer on the Mount

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,980
 as we've journeyed through the Sermon on the Mount.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,240
 We'll look at Jesus' last kind of passage in this

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,160
 as he wraps it all up.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,920
 Has anyone bought a house recently?

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
 Like in the last like month, two months?

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,040
 Yeah, okay, yeah, so you know what I'm talking about.

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
 Okay, so if you don't, maybe you don't know this,

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,460
 but right now in Dallas, Fort Worth,

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,720
 Dallas is like the most insane market of all time,

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,680
 literally in the city, right now the hottest.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,920
 In fact, this past month, it tied San Francisco

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,060
 for the hottest market in the United States of America.

28
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,920
 Probably the only time we'll ever be tied

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,160
 with San Francisco in anything,

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,080
 but it tied San Francisco for the hottest market.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,300
 And what I didn't, all of that I didn't know

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,180
 when my wife and I decided to sign,

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,680
 and we basically signed a lease that ends in September,

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
 and so we were like, oh, we'll just buy a house in August.

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,360
 That'll be great.

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,240
 And as rookies who've never bought a house before,

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
 we didn't realize that we would be buying it

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,360
 in the worst time in the history of Dallas, but we did.

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,960
 And so we planned to buy a house, and we began to see

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,240
 that because the market is so hot right now,

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,960
 like all the homes that we could afford

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,600
 within our budget, #pastor, were like overinflated,

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,760
 or like every home is like,

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,080
 and you gotta put $20,000 on top of it.

45
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,960
 So it's like, the homes we could afford

46
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,560
 were just not livable.

47
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
 It's like, isn't that a shed?

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
 Really, that's the best we can do?

49
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,200
 But so we've kind of been planning that.

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,680
 We're like, we're just gonna ride this thing out.

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
 It's gonna cool down eventually.

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,920
 We're just gonna ride it out, we'll wait.

53
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,640
 And so a few weeks in, our realtor,

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,520
 we have a friend who's a realtor,

55
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
 sent us a home that was like,

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,240
 hey, this is in your price range.

57
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,440
 It's a little bit, could use some fixer upper stuff,

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,560
 but it's in an area you guys have said

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,000
 you would like to be in.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,540
 And so we're like, great, let's go check it out.

61
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,720
 This is perfect, awesome.

62
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,960
 So we go, we see the house.

63
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
 It's in an area we love.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
 It's going great, this is perfect.

65
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,240
 Yeah, we can paint that, change those shutters.

66
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,000
 It'll be awesome, perfect.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,440
 So we get an inspection.

68
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,280
 And our realtor gives us the inspection.

69
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,880
 The inspector goes through, if you've never bought a house,

70
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,000
 they bring in some guy who's an inspector full-time.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,640
 I don't know what else you do if you're an inspector.

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,200
 But he's an inspector and he looks at everything

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,940
 that you'll need to get replaced.

74
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,560
 And he begins to tell us on his inspection

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,680
 that the most significant thing with the house

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,760
 is the foundation is off.

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,760
 People are shaking their heads with horror stories.

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,040
 And I, because we're rookies, I'm like,

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
 oh, the foundation's off, that's great.

80
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,280
 I mean, what does that mean?

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,380
 How much does that cost to fix?

82
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,520
 What is that, like 100 bucks?

83
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,480
 We can take that, that's great, we'll move in.

84
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
 We can paint everything, it's gonna be great.

85
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,040
 And they go, no, it's a lot more serious.

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,980
 It's really bad.

87
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,640
 And I'm like, okay, how bad could it be?

88
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,040
 And they say 10 grand to 30 grand.

89
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,560
 And I'm like, okay, first, that's a lot of margin.

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,560
 Second off, how could it possibly be that bad?

91
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,020
 And then, of course, my wife is like, I'm out.

92
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,640
 And I'm like, no, no, no, it's gonna be great.

93
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
 We're gonna fix it.

94
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,800
 And you know when you really want something

95
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
 and you go into like problem-solving mode,

96
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
 you're like, it's gonna be fine.

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,800
 How bad, I mean, how important is the foundation, really?

98
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,940
 And the inspector's like, look,

99
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,680
 that's why the floor is slanted on a decline.

100
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,440
 And I'm like, I mean, that's like preferential, right?

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,160
 I mean, some people might like a slanted floor,

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,980
 leaning tower, Pisa, ever heard of it?

103
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,920
 We just won't have chairs with wheels on 'em.

104
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,240
 It's gonna be great.

105
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,180
 And he's like, no, that's why the sheetrock has cracks.

106
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,840
 It's only gonna get worse.

107
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,700
 And I'm like, no, we'll just get big paintings

108
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,760
 and hang it over that.

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
 It's gonna be fine.

110
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
 Everything will be great.

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,400
 And he begins to lay out.

112
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,080
 And I'm like, worst case scenario,

113
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
 what could possibly happen if we don't fix it?

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,480
 And he says, the house would fall apart.

115
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,800
 It would literally fall on you.

116
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,600
 And of course, I'm like, oh, I guess we shouldn't do that.

117
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
 (audience laughing)

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,880
 And we decide to pass it.

119
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
 Or as we process it, I probably still actually fought.

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,480
 I'm like, look, we could just prop it up.

121
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,920
 But as our community and wisecounter around us was like,

122
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
 that's a bad idea.

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
 You do not wanna get a house that has a bad foundation.

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,800
 You do not wanna get a house that has a bad foundation.

125
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,720
 Now, the reason I start with that story

126
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
 that recently took place is because tonight,

127
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,880
 as we wrap up the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapter 7,

128
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
 if you wanna open your Bibles, if you have one,

129
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,640
 you can flip open there.

130
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
 If you don't, we've got free Bibles in the Welcome Center

131
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,520
 we'd love to give you.

132
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,920
 The reason I start there is 'cause in the final words

133
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,280
 Jesus gives us after laying out everything

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,520
 we've talked about for the past 10, 12 weeks,

135
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,960
 he begins to wrap up what it looks like

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
 to now apply and live out what he's taught.

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
 And he uses a illustration saying that just like in a house,

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
 if you're getting a house, you don't wanna get a house

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,600
 that has a bad foundation.

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,160
 All of us in life are going to build a house

141
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
 that is our life.

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
 We're building a life, so to speak,

143
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,120
 and you don't wanna build your life on the wrong foundation

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
 because the cost and the falling apart

145
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,820
 that would take place in a house is not nearly as bad

146
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,480
 as if you build your life on the wrong foundation.

147
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,680
 So you better make sure it's the right one

148
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
 Jesus is going to say.

149
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,760
 So what we're gonna do for the next 30 or so minutes,

150
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,000
 we're gonna look at six verses.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
 I'm gonna give you three points from that text,

152
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
 and then I'll kinda wrap us up with a story for the night

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
 as we just explore Jesus's final words

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,000
 on the foundation you and I are to build our lives on

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,760
 and the consequences of building on the wrong foundation.

156
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
 So we're in Matthew chapter seven.

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
 Flip open to Matthew chapter seven, verse 24,

158
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,340
 and we'll pick it up there as we explore this final topic

159
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,580
 of building our life on the right foundation.

160
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,860
 Jesus has just taught all kinds of different subjects,

161
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,500
 and he begins to launch into now what they're to do.

162
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,340
 Here's what he says.

163
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,140
 "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine

164
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,780
 "and puts them into practice is like a wise man

165
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,300
 "who built his house on the rock."

166
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,340
 So our first point, a wise foundation

167
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,400
 comes from following Jesus's instructions.

168
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,860
 A wise foundation, living and building out your life,

169
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,940
 the life that you're gonna build,

170
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,540
 it comes, a wise foundation comes from building it

171
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,860
 on following Jesus's instructions.

172
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,900
 What he just said, his audience, he basically says,

173
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,240
 "Look, everyone who hears what I just taught,

174
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,440
 "all the things that I just taught about,

175
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,360
 "love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.

176
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,580
 "Hey, when it comes to money,"

177
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,740
 and Jesus taught about money,

178
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,340
 if you remember that week a few weeks back,

179
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,200
 and he says, "Look, be as generous as possible.

180
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,840
 "Don't store up treasures here on earth.

181
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,980
 "Store 'em up in heaven."

182
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,820
 He talks about religious hypocrisy and says,

183
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
 "Look, don't be fooled by people

184
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,260
 "that act like they're religious,

185
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,740
 "but they actually don't practice what they preach."

186
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,160
 Talks about anxiety and he says,

187
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,540
 "Look, don't be anxious.

188
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,420
 "Trust in God."

189
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,680
 He talks about lust and he says,

190
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,780
 "You think lust is not that big of a deal?

191
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,660
 "It's adultery."

192
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,900
 He says, "Marriage is permanent."

193
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,220
 He says, "Look, when you have relational conflict,"

194
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,940
 he covers all these different topics.

195
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,660
 If you think, we're all over the place.

196
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,780
 And he covers all these different topics

197
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,640
 and then he goes, "Relationships, when you have conflict,

198
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,400
 "be diligent to pursue conflict resolution

199
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,380
 "with different people in your life."

200
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,180
 And then he finished last week, as we talked about,

201
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,300
 and JP talked about,

202
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,400
 "Hey, don't put your faith in religious actions to save you.

203
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,440
 "They will not save you.

204
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,740
 "Only a savior can save you."

205
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,040
 And he takes all of that and he says,

206
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,720
 "Look, everyone who hears everything that I just taught

207
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,480
 "and not just hears it, but lives by it,

208
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,700
 "is like a wise person who builds their home on a rock."

209
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
 And Jesus' audience is going,

210
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,260
 "Look, a wise person who builds your house on the rock,

211
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,240
 "that's like saying the same thing twice.

212
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,940
 "Only people are only,

213
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,600
 "everyone builds their house on the rock, Jesus.

214
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
 "That's just what you do."

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,540
 His audience is going,

216
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,500
 "Of course that's what you do, that's common sense.

217
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,200
 "Even today, we still build on the rock.

218
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,480
 "You don't build on gravel, you don't build on water,

219
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,740
 "you don't build on sand,

220
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,700
 "you don't build on any of these things.

221
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,820
 "That's just what you do."

222
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,900
 And Jesus is saying, "Exactly.

223
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,300
 "When you follow my instructions,

224
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,400
 "you're just using common sense.

225
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,080
 "You are living a wise life.

226
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,080
 "You're living in line with my design for the universe."

227
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,340
 Really, it's kind of an arrogant thing to say

228
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,340
 for anyone other than Jesus to say,

229
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,100
 where he says, "Look, everyone who follows

230
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,180
 "everything that I just taught,

231
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,940
 "if you will do all of that, you're a wise person.

232
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,600
 "But if you don't, you're not.

233
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,820
 "But if you're the son of God, you can get away with that."

234
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,660
 Because Jesus, as the wisest person who ever lived,

235
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,760
 says, "Look, I'm inviting and telling you

236
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,020
 "how I designed the world to work,

237
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,780
 "marriage to work, anxiety to go away,

238
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,880
 "how I designed relationships to happen.

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,520
 "Build your life on the rock of my word.

240
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,980
 "And it doesn't happen by just listening," he says,

241
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,500
 "but it happens by obeying or practicing."

242
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,860
 Like, here's what's so crazy about what Jesus says

243
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,620
 in that even first snippet,

244
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,140
 that you can have perfect church attendance.

245
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,100
 You can come every single week and you hear the messages

246
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,640
 and you're like, "Oh my gosh, that's so convicting.

247
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,480
 "Man, that was good.

248
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
 "Love the chains.

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,540
 "That was so powerful.

250
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,380
 "That closing story, man, that was awesome."

251
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,720
 You can come and you can hear all that stuff.

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,100
 You can pray every day.

253
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,000
 You can memorize your Bible and be a fool, Jesus says.

254
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,520
 That it is not hearing, but applying God's word.

255
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,520
 A wise foundation comes from following Jesus' instructions,

256
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,160
 living by them.

257
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,320
 That it is not attendance.

258
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,640
 And maybe you grew up in a church culture

259
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,240
 where like, for some reason it seemed like,

260
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,480
 hey, attendance was the big thing God was after.

261
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,660
 I just need to attend.

262
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,880
 The message of Jesus is, look, God's not out for you

263
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,960
 to attend just a building.

264
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,000
 He's out for you to attend to his instructions

265
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,100
 in your life, to live by those things.

266
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,080
 Practically speaking, that's the thing

267
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,540
 that makes a difference.

268
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,960
 That in your life and in my life,

269
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,940
 the amount of Bible knowledge that you know

270
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,380
 is not the determiner of whether you're a wise person,

271
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,820
 Jesus says, but the amount that you live by

272
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,820
 is the only thing that practically in this life

273
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,580
 is going to make a difference.

274
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,420
 Not talking about heaven or hell,

275
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,840
 but living by his words, Jesus says,

276
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,760
 that person is the wise person.

277
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,220
 They don't just hear, this is how God instructs us to date.

278
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,980
 They don't just hear, this is how God says

279
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,860
 we should view money, this is how God says

280
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,420
 we should view sex, and they go away

281
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,380
 and they're like, yeah, that was good.

282
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,100
 And they can even talk about it in their community

283
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,360
 and they know all that stuff.

284
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,580
 They live by it.

285
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,940
 Jesus says, that man is different.

286
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,500
 That man.

287
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,940
 Practicing what Jesus instructs is the thing

288
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,700
 that makes all the difference.

289
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
 James, the brother of Jesus, really gives,

290
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,140
 if you want a summary statement for this,

291
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,400
 James, in his book, James, gives a summary statement

292
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,360
 that's very, very similar.

293
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
 And some of you guys may not know this.

294
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,280
 Jesus had a little brother.

295
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,120
 You imagine that?

296
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,940
 James.

297
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,400
 James is one of, honestly, the strongest arguments

298
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,560
 for the resurrection of Jesus that we have.

299
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,140
 Because James, who didn't believe that Jesus

300
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,780
 was the son of God, he didn't believe

301
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,840
 there was anything special about him,

302
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,100
 he didn't believe any of that,

303
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,720
 comes around and believes Jesus is God.

304
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,120
 Wonder why?

305
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,500
 He saw him die and then he saw him living again.

306
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,600
 I mean, think about what it would take for you right now

307
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,360
 to believe that your sibling is the son of God.

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
 You ever think about that?

309
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,080
 Like, I have a little brother and a big brother,

310
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,120
 and I'd be like, yeah, I'd play t-ball with him,

311
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,780
 and no way, he's not the son of God.

312
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,200
 But James comes around, he believes that Jesus

313
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,920
 is the son of God, and he becomes a believer,

314
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,520
 and he writes this inside of his book,

315
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,000
 and he basically gives a summary statement

316
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,480
 to what his older brother, older half-brother,

317
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
 would have taught him.

318
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,680
 And he says this, James 1:22.

319
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
 Do not merely listen to the word

320
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,800
 and so deceive yourselves,

321
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,700
 but do what it says.

322
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,980
 Why would you say deceive yourselves, James?

323
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,380
 Because here's what's funny about attending.

324
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,900
 Like, attending and hearing God's word be taught,

325
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,100
 and even agreeing with what is taught from God's word.

326
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,240
 Even if you're like, yeah, I agree,

327
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,160
 and I attend church, and all those things,

328
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,340
 those things don't make the difference.

329
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,220
 James says, look, if you just attend and you listen

330
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,980
 and you don't do, you're deceiving yourself.

331
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,540
 You feel better 'cause you're like,

332
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,500
 yes, I'm back in church, and I'm just trying

333
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,320
 to work on this.

334
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,620
 You feel emotionally better.

335
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,480
 You may feel some guilt relief.

336
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,580
 Says, that doesn't, you're deceiving yourself.

337
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,640
 It's the person who does my instructions

338
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,780
 that will experience a life that's founded

339
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,660
 on a firm foundation, a life founded

340
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,380
 on the only foundation, as we're gonna see,

341
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,440
 that will stand or worth founding on.

342
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
 But Jesus continues, and he really gives,

343
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,720
 actually, I included in here an illustration,

344
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,340
 but I feel like the point has been clear.

345
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,660
 We see this in like other arenas of life, don't we?

346
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,780
 Like it is not just having something

347
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,180
 that makes a difference or even hearing it,

348
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,380
 like exercise equipment.

349
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,620
 Has anyone ever bought exercise equipment?

350
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,900
 And it like makes no difference,

351
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,220
 but we feel so healthy when we're buying it

352
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,740
 and taking it out of the store, and you're like,

353
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
 I'm gonna work out every day for six hours.

354
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,580
 It's gonna be awesome, or vitamins.

355
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,900
 We know that it is not just having them.

356
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,580
 Advocare, is anyone selling Advocare in here?

357
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,820
 I have bought, oh man, I have bought Advocare,

358
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,020
 and I'm like, I'm gonna get healthy.

359
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,020
 I'm gonna take these vitamins three different times.

360
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,220
 I have bought these, and I haven't taken one.

361
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,580
 I keep wasting money on Advocare,

362
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,260
 because it's not, practically speaking,

363
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,920
 it doesn't matter if you buy the product or if you do it.

364
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,380
 It matters if you apply it,

365
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,060
 and Jesus says truth is the same way.

366
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,780
 Application is everything.

367
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,440
 You can know all the right things,

368
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,660
 but if you don't do them,

369
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,740
 it will make no difference in your life.

370
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,180
 And he gives a promise for what will happen

371
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,480
 if you do do them.

372
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,700
 Verse 25, the rain came down,

373
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,080
 he continues this little parable or story

374
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,980
 to illustrate us building our lives.

375
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,140
 "And the streams rose, and the winds blew

376
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,640
 "and beat against that house.

377
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,280
 "Yet it did not fall,

378
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,900
 "because it had its foundation on the rock."

379
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,340
 Second point is a wise foundation will stand.

380
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,980
 A wise foundation is built

381
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,340
 by following Jesus' instructions.

382
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,940
 Saying I'm going to live, God,

383
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,540
 whatever you're going to ask of me

384
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,140
 before I even read it, before I even listen to it,

385
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,620
 the answer is yes.

386
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,580
 I'm going to do what the author of life said.

387
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,820
 I'm just gonna trust you,

388
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,340
 not just with my eternal life,

389
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,740
 and I can't do much about that anyways,

390
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,420
 but with this life, moment by moment,

391
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,180
 how you say I should date,

392
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,220
 how you say I should view my career,

393
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,660
 I'm gonna trust you,

394
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,880
 and I'm gonna do those things.

395
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,980
 How you say I should live in community,

396
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,180
 I'm gonna follow you and follow your instructions.

397
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,040
 And when you do that, Jesus says,

398
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,380
 you're building a wise foundation

399
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,900
 that will stand when the storms come.

400
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,100
 I think what was so interesting

401
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,340
 or just stood out to me is,

402
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,880
 it's not that the storms,

403
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,260
 when you follow what Jesus says,

404
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,100
 it's not that the storms don't come.

405
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,660
 It's not that you won't face hardship in life.

406
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,560
 There's weird teachers out there,

407
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,380
 even inside of the church movement,

408
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,300
 prosperity teachers, if you will.

409
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,460
 See 'em on TV a lot of times,

410
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,620
 where it's like, yes, if you just will give us $1,

411
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,540
 God will give you $100 in there.

412
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,020
 If you will just pray for blessings,

413
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,700
 we're wishing blessings on all of you,

414
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,160
 and God is going to bless you,

415
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,820
 that cancer will go away.

416
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,180
 I can't believe I keep going here, this is terrible.

417
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,980
 (audience laughing)

418
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
 Man, oh wow, okay.

419
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,460
 Gotta work through that.

420
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,180
 Anyways, what that teaches is crazy.

421
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,220
 The Bible doesn't teach that.

422
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,580
 Jesus promises his followers, it is last night together,

423
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,500
 gets 'em all together, last supper, they call it.

424
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,540
 Jesus gets 'em all together and he gives 'em a promise,

425
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,100
 and it's like, duh, I don't even know if we need that.

426
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,260
 In this world, you will have trouble.

427
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,680
 You're gonna face trouble.

428
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,700
 You're gonna face hardship.

429
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,620
 There will be storms.

430
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,080
 Following me and following my teachings

431
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,760
 will not help you avoid the storms,

432
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,180
 but face them and stay standing.

433
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,720
 If you will follow and build your life,

434
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,180
 you're going to face storms,

435
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,340
 and so you're going to face singleness.

436
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,420
 Some of you may feel like you're in a storm right now,

437
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,060
 job loss, and the promise isn't,

438
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,180
 hey, if you just follow me,

439
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,260
 everything's gonna be perfect all the time.

440
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
 That's not true.

441
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,780
 But if you follow me in the midst of the storm

442
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,260
 where others will crumble, you'll stand,

443
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,220
 and you'll remain standing.

444
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,980
 And I think what's so hard is the reality is

445
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,780
 storms are coming for all of us,

446
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,380
 and there's part of me that doesn't emotionally feel that.

447
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,340
 I'm in my late 20s and I feel bulletproof.

448
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,160
 I really do.

449
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,660
 I just don't think, today I could die, today it could end,

450
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,980
 or today my wife could die,

451
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,220
 or today we could lose our child.

452
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,820
 I just don't think those things.

453
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,260
 Despite, you know what's weird about ministry

454
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,300
 is you work in such close proximity,

455
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,140
 like working at a church,

456
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,980
 you work and you're exposed all the time

457
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,340
 to just stories of pain.

458
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,740
 Like you're so exposed to the reality

459
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,060
 of how broken our world is,

460
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,620
 because people call, and thank goodness,

461
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,720
 the church is still a place where people call

462
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,140
 when they're hurting,

463
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,420
 when they're walking through miscarriage,

464
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,140
 when they're walking through the death of a spouse,

465
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,020
 whatever it is.

466
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,200
 But you're so exposed to just a front row seat.

467
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,860
 I mean, there's not a lot of people

468
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,700
 when they call the church,

469
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,180
 it's like, "Hey, yeah, everything's going great.

470
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,020
 "Just wanted to say hi

471
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,660
 "and just see how things are going with you guys."

472
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,760
 They call when they're hurting.

473
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,900
 And when you see this front row seat,

474
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,460
 if you work in ministry, you know what I'm talking about.

475
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,900
 You see like these two responses.

476
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,620
 You see the person who in the midst of everything

477
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,020
 that's falling apart around them,

478
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,460
 in the midst of trial they're facing,

479
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,300
 they didn't ask for.

480
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,740
 A tumor that showed up that they didn't ask for.

481
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,060
 Losing a child, they didn't ask for.

482
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,960
 In the midst of all of that, they still go,

483
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,060
 "God, I'm going to choose to trust you.

484
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
 "This isn't easy.

485
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,260
 "I'm not gonna smile, but my God is in the heavens

486
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,340
 "and I'm gonna choose to trust you right now

487
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,780
 "because I've built my life on you,

488
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,860
 "on your word and on your teachings."

489
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,020
 And you see that person.

490
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,420
 And then you see this other perspective

491
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,980
 where the same painful circumstances around them,

492
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,420
 where everything's crumbling.

493
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,340
 And their response is not that, but they begin to crumble.

494
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,220
 Never surprised when people turn to whatever medication

495
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,180
 to cope, numbing their pain through alcohol

496
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,860
 or Ashley Madison or whatever it is.

497
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,820
 People are just looking for release.

498
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,340
 And when you're not founded on God's word,

499
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,980
 Jesus says, "You won't stand."

500
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,980
 But the promise is if you and I embrace a life

501
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,420
 where I'm gonna follow Jesus, what you say,

502
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,900
 I'm going all in with you.

503
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,820
 When the storms of life come and they will,

504
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,780
 for all of us, this world is so broken.

505
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,100
 As an American, it can be easy to think it's not.

506
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,740
 And it is, and they're coming.

507
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,180
 "You will stand," Jesus says.

508
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,900
 As you think about how does obedience

509
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,340
 allow you to stand firm in your faith?

510
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,980
 Like as I was thinking about that this week,

511
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,940
 I was like, "I wonder why that is."

512
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,380
 And here's kind of what I began to think about

513
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,220
 and really realize.

514
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,940
 Every time that you and I,

515
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,340
 every time that you are obedient to God's word,

516
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,660
 like you're like, "Yeah, I'm gonna do,

517
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,040
 "God says this is who I should date,

518
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,300
 "or this is how I should date,

519
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,040
 "this is how I should handle sexuality."

520
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,940
 I'm gonna choose to obey what you said.

521
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,260
 Every time that you and I do that,

522
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
 what happens is our faith grows.

523
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,100
 You notice that?

524
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,340
 Every time that you and I choose to step out and go out,

525
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,760
 I'm gonna trust you as it relates to money.

526
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,080
 I'm gonna trust you as it relates to this.

527
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
 Your faith grows.

528
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,200
 I mean, we see this in relationships.

529
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,400
 Anytime that you have someone who's credible in your life

530
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,740
 and you take 'em up on it and you're like,

531
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,920
 "Yeah, I trust his opinion, I'm gonna do that."

532
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
 And it ends up working out,

533
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,600
 you're like, "I trust it even more."

534
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,560
 Like right now, we're buying or looking to buy a home,

535
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,120
 and JP, who's way more knowledgeable

536
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,160
 about home stuff than I am, he's like a realtor,

537
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,560
 and my wife is like, "Look, I trust JP's opinion

538
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,600
 "way more than I trust yours."

539
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,480
 And I'm like, "Ouch, okay, first off,

540
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,000
 "one flesh," I thought, "Hello, I'm your husband."

541
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,260
 And she's like, "But he's been there,

542
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,660
 "he's made those decisions, he's walked through that,

543
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,340
 "and we've seen and trusted his advice and thoughts,

544
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,480
 "and our trust has grown."

545
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,420
 Same thing with God.

546
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,860
 Anytime you choose to trust him, your faith grows.

547
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,640
 You're adding to the foundation,

548
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,080
 and every decision that you choose to trust him,

549
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,240
 you're adding to the foundation of faith.

550
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,120
 Probably the best, which allows you to stand

551
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,120
 and be firmly planted and trust in God no matter what comes.

552
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,240
 Probably the best example that I know of this

553
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,800
 is our senior pastor, Todd, who just has such,

554
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,520
 he has such a, he has a faith, honestly,

555
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,320
 that's foreign to me.

556
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,280
 Like Todd, a year and a half ago,

557
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,320
 found out he had cancer on his foot,

558
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,540
 and I remember his response, and I was like,

559
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,720
 I don't even know how to compute that,

560
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,960
 'cause that is so far from me, I can't even imagine.

561
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,560
 And his response, he found out he had cancer on his foot,

562
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,520
 they were gonna go in and try to remove it and all that,

563
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,060
 and he basically said, "Look, this wasn't what I planned,

564
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,320
 "but I'm gonna choose to trust God.

565
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,360
 "I mean, what else am I gonna do?

566
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,860
 "God isn't surprised, I may be surprised.

567
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,200
 "If he takes me home at 53, then that's what he's gonna do,

568
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,520
 "but I can't thwart that anyways,

569
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
 "or if he allows me to live to 80, I'm gonna trust him.

570
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,820
 "I know he's good, and I know he's in control.

571
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,260
 "I'm gonna do everything I can to get rid of it,

572
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,000
 "but then I'm gonna trust him and sleep well."

573
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,560
 And I just remember being like,

574
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,760
 man, what are you, like, Superman, Clark Kent over here?

575
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,700
 How do you have faith like that?

576
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,260
 Like, if I, if cancer, I didn't even have to have cancer,

577
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,460
 and I'm like, my eye hurts.

578
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,080
 Do I have eye cancer right now?

579
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,200
 Oh, no!

580
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,280
 Like, I'm so foreign, but how did Todd get there?

581
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,780
 It's not 'cause he's Superman.

582
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,260
 It's because he's paved through years and years

583
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,260
 of trusting God, his faith, this firm foundation,

584
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,920
 that no matter what comes my way, I'm gonna trust you.

585
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,600
 And when the storms come, his house isn't shaken.

586
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,920
 He may not wanna go through the storm, but he stands firm.

587
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,360
 And Jesus says, "If you and I will build our lives

588
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,120
 "like that, when the storms come,"

589
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,560
 and you're not gonna believe me right now,

590
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,960
 probably emotionally, "they're coming for you.

591
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,180
 "And they're coming for me."

592
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,060
 And he says, "When they come, your only hope,

593
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,740
 "standing firm, is by right now beginning

594
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,320
 "to build your life around my teachings.

595
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,660
 "Not that God's gonna love you less or love you more,

596
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,380
 "but you may experience more life

597
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,260
 "because you're getting it from a God who loves you.

598
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,360
 "Instead, I'm giving you instructions to give you life."

599
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,440
 And he finishes, it really gives us a warning

600
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
 for not applying for all of us in the room.

601
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,020
 He says this, verse 26.

602
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,360
 "But everyone who hears these words of mine

603
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,860
 "and does not put them into practice

604
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,720
 "is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.

605
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,440
 "The rain came down and the streams rose

606
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 "and the winds blew and they beat against that house."

607
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
 Same storm, same scenario.

608
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,640
 "And it fell with a great crash."

609
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
 A third point from really this text

610
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,760
 is a foolish foundation will fall.

611
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,000
 A foolish foundation, a foundation not built on God's words,

612
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,560
 not built on the teachings of Jesus.

613
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,880
 Jesus says, "If you will apply everything

614
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,580
 "that I just taught you, if you will begin to use that

615
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,180
 "as the practice of your life,

616
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,920
 "that's what I'm going to pursue,

617
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,640
 "being obedient to those teachings."

618
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,100
 He says, "You will have a firm foundation.

619
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,520
 "But if you don't, no matter whose teachings

620
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,580
 "or instructions you follow,

621
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,840
 "you will build a foolish house that will crumble

622
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,880
 "in the midst of the storm."

623
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,760
 I mean, that's so crazy.

624
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,400
 If it wasn't Jesus, it would be so arrogant.

625
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,240
 Think about it.

626
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,120
 It's not like he's saying, "Look,

627
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,800
 "if you follow my instructions,

628
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,680
 "you're gonna have a strong house.

629
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,760
 "But if you follow the devil's instructions,

630
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,000
 "that house is gonna crumble."

631
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,480
 He says, "If you follow anyone else's, your own opinion,

632
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,860
 "if that's how you build your life,

633
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
 "if your life is built on the opinion of,

634
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,140
 "this is kind of what I think I should do

635
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,120
 "and this is how I should date

636
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
 "and this is how I should live,

637
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,020
 "or if you build it on Cosmo Magazine or Hollywood's

638
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,460
 "or I don't know, whatever, Oprah's advice."

639
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,460
 He says, "If you build it on anyone else's instructions,

640
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,940
 "you are building a house that when the storms

641
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,100
 "that are coming for all of us

642
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,980
 "in a world that's just broken,

643
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,860
 "come, we'll crumble in the midst of it."

644
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,920
 He gives a prediction or a prophecy

645
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,680
 about anyone who builds their life right now,

646
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,940
 not on his teachings and not on his instructions.

647
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,900
 He gives a blueprint.

648
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,740
 It's what I wrote in my notes.

649
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,940
 Jesus gives us a blueprint for how to ruin your life.

650
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,640
 Jesus says, "If you follow anyone else's instructions,

651
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,460
 "other than mine, other than God's word,

652
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,320
 "you are building a blueprint on your home.

653
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,480
 "You're building a life that is designed

654
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,280
 "basically of how to ruin your life

655
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,700
 "and you're following it to a T."

656
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,300
 "Fell with a great crash, you may have great,

657
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,900
 "was the crash of it."

658
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,260
 If you build your life on anything other than Jesus's word,

659
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,900
 when the storms come, that life will crumble

660
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,580
 and God will still love you and there's still grace

661
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,580
 and he's a God of second chances,

662
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,460
 but he's a God who loves you and says,

663
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,420
 "I don't want that to be the case.

664
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,100
 "Will you trust me, not just with eternal life,

665
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,580
 "but with this life?"

666
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,060
 And you're going to build your life

667
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,540
 on someone's instructions.

668
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,900
 That's why in neutral, Jesus says,

669
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,780
 "If you don't attend to my word, it's gonna go bad."

670
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,420
 Because in neutral, you're just bombarded

671
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,820
 with a million messages a day.

672
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,260
 Think about how many messages today

673
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,540
 were sent to you by the culture around us.

674
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,060
 On this is, hey, this is the person

675
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,900
 that you should be looking for when you date.

676
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,340
 If you watched "The Bachelor" last night

677
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,060
 or "The Bachelor in Paradise" last night,

678
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,900
 that's what you heard, that's what you received.

679
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,260
 This is how many are the messages that you receive.

680
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,080
 On this is the home that you need.

681
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,420
 This is the car you need to drive.

682
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,980
 This is the career you need to be at.

683
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,700
 This is the person that you need to be looking for.

684
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,420
 This is the person you need to marry.

685
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,700
 And if you follow the messages that culture every day,

686
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,020
 I live in the same world,

687
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,840
 sins, and you build your life on that.

688
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,900
 Or you just don't build on Jesus's words,

689
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,540
 you're building a life that will crumble, he says.

690
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,300
 It's so harsh.

691
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,660
 And if there was a season of life

692
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,020
 that was like so relevant, if this is true,

693
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,060
 and we believe that it is,

694
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,260
 we believe what Jesus is saying is true,

695
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,180
 what other season of life is more important

696
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,980
 than the one you're in?

697
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,540
 Like what other season, think about it.

698
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,760
 If you're tuned out and you're counting these wood things,

699
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,980
 again, come back in to me.

700
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,980
 If you're in any season of life where it's gonna be,

701
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,460
 hey, look, I need to make sure

702
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,220
 that I am attending to building my life.

703
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,900
 Jesus says everyone's building a life.

704
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,260
 You can't walk out of here and not say,

705
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,860
 no, I'm gonna start tomorrow building a life.

706
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,540
 You're building it, you laid bricks today.

707
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,480
 And you either built them on the sands

708
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,020
 that shift from culture around us,

709
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,140
 you built them on Jesus's words and instructions,

710
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,660
 and if there ever was a season

711
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,140
 where you were laying a lot of bricks,

712
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,100
 it's the young adult season.

713
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,660
 I mean, you're deciding who you're gonna marry,

714
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,220
 where you're gonna work, where you're gonna live.

715
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,820
 80%, we say that all the time,

716
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,300
 80% of you guys are gonna get married in the next decade.

717
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,140
 Think about that.

718
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,260
 Maybe you're like, oh my gosh,

719
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,820
 that is the best news I've heard all night.

720
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,200
 It's not a guarantee, but 80%, statistically speaking.

721
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,300
 Keep moving.

722
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,020
 80% of you are going to,

723
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,740
 as you decide who you're gonna date,

724
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:22,260
 who you're gonna marry, and there's such a world around you

725
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,500
 telling you who you should be looking for.

726
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,060
 Girls, especially, like the more, man,

727
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,020
 the more in ministry there's something about,

728
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,640
 just as you wade through, the man you're going to marry,

729
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,900
 please, please, because there's something about weird,

730
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,940
 like a lot of times, even people inside of the church

731
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,040
 in the fall of Christ are like, yeah,

732
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,860
 but I kinda like an edgy, edgy Evan

733
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,100
 is the guy that I'm looking for,

734
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,140
 or bad to the bone Barry.

735
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
 Don't marry bad Barry.

736
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,900
 Marry grounded Greg.

737
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,820
 Grounded Greg may be boring,

738
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,180
 but he's gonna be the guy you're gonna wanna be with.

739
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,740
 And Greg, but he's married.

740
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,980
 (laughing)

741
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,900
 That wasn't planned.

742
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,300
 Marry, please, and the same thing with the guys.

743
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,620
 I don't know names for women,

744
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,940
 and I'll get in trouble if I try to give like,

745
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,420
 sassy Sarah.

746
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,580
 Don't marry her.

747
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,180
 Seriously, marry the person who's grounded,

748
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,460
 who's rooted in it.

749
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,320
 Marry that person, not just they attend the porch,

750
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
 'cause Jesus says, look, all of you got,

751
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,540
 there's tons of people who attended.

752
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,180
 That doesn't mean you're not a fool.

753
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,100
 It's the person who's living by it.

754
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,700
 That's the person, as you wade through the waters of dating,

755
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,140
 and you make this lifelong commitment,

756
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,500
 that's the person to look for.

757
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,820
 As you make career decisions,

758
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,220
 and you decide what career path you're gonna take,

759
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,540
 where you're gonna work,

760
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,900
 what's gonna drive your decisions,

761
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,660
 don't allow the world around you,

762
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,860
 who's gonna be like, look,

763
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,100
 everyone needs to go to med school.

764
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,620
 Everyone needs to be a doctor around here,

765
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,660
 because bad at the moment, Barry's a doctor,

766
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,660
 and that's what ladies want.

767
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,220
 Don't allow the culture around you

768
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,300
 to determine and push you in a direction.

769
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,980
 Career path, there's nothing wrong with being a doctor.

770
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,940
 I hope lots of you guys are doctors,

771
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,840
 but the point is, don't allow the world around you,

772
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,100
 are you gonna be instructed on God's word,

773
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,980
 by God's word, on where to work,

774
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,260
 on how you're going to work,

775
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,740
 on the ethics you maintain at work,

776
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,580
 even when everyone's like,

777
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,940
 this is just part of the industry.

778
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,020
 This is commercial real estate.

779
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,860
 It's just what you do.

780
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,900
 You kind of fib a little bit here,

781
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,740
 you move things around.

782
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,020
 Are you going to listen to the sands of culture,

783
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,640
 or to God's word?

784
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,500
 Don't allow the world around you

785
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,460
 to push you in paving your character.

786
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,820
 We say that so often,

787
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,340
 which is Jesus' essentially point.

788
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,380
 You're paving a foundation.

789
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,360
 You are becoming someone.

790
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,700
 You're becoming the husband you are going to be someday.

791
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,700
 You're becoming the father, the wife, all of those things.

792
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,260
 They don't change when you get married.

793
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
 But you're becoming them.

794
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,660
 Today, you laid bricks on the marital house

795
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,560
 you're gonna have.

796
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,340
 Whose advice, whose bricks are you gonna lay?

797
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,440
 God of the universe who loves you, or your own.

798
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,140
 And he's inviting you right now to build,

799
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,100
 and I want your marriage, marital house,

800
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,220
 your relational house, finance, all those different things.

801
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,020
 I want them to be built on my word,

802
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,420
 because when the storms come, and they're coming,

803
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,640
 you will have trouble.

804
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,320
 Jesus promises you'll stand.

805
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,120
 You'll be among those who stand firm.

806
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,380
 Man, I think,

807
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,200
 if there's like any, just as your life,

808
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,100
 even at the house thing, the house thing's been weird,

809
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,880
 'cause like there's engineers that will come in

810
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,260
 as we were looking to buy a home,

811
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,560
 so now back to a normal, actual house.

812
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,640
 And they'll look at all the structure,

813
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,080
 and the structural engineers,

814
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,600
 and they're like, no, this needs to be changed,

815
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,480
 and there's so much money,

816
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,440
 and so much care, and intentionality,

817
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,280
 this needs to be one centimeter over,

818
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,560
 this needs to be just this different.

819
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,160
 Because they're like, look, it's a valuable home,

820
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
 there's hundreds of thousands of dollars,

821
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,920
 or $100,000 in it.

822
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,200
 How much more valuable is your life

823
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,500
 that you get one shot at your 20s?

824
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,740
 One chance at your first marriage,

825
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,240
 hopefully your only marriage?

826
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,440
 And Jesus says, will you build it on my blueprint?

827
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,320
 And I'm promising you will not stand before me.

828
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,640
 No one will ever stand before God and go,

829
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,960
 really, I kept myself for marriage, are you serious?

830
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,560
 I wish I could go back and do that over again.

831
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,120
 Really, I was generous?

832
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,160
 Really, I didn't allow my job to consume me?

833
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,680
 I followed your way, and I felt ripped off.

834
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,480
 He says, no, will you follow me,

835
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,680
 and follow me to life, and build your home around that?

836
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,940
 Not obey to make God love you more,

837
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,880
 but obey because they're instructions from a God

838
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,280
 who really loves you, and really loves me.

839
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,600
 And he's not up there going, I cannot believe

840
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,320
 that they're not obeying my instructions again on sexuality,

841
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,400
 that is so frustrating.

842
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,220
 He's going, look, I love you!

843
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,760
 Will you listen to me?

844
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,560
 Does, gives me no joy in ripping you off,

845
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,040
 I'm here to give you life.

846
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,760
 Will you build your life on my instructions?

847
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,080
 Will you build your life around my teachings?

848
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,080
 And when the storms come, you will stand.

849
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,000
 And in your 20s and 30s, I think it's hard

850
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,980
 'cause it doesn't feel like, there's no clouds in the sky.

851
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,380
 Like, some of you guys are living outside

852
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,800
 of God's will right now, and you know it.

853
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,520
 I mean, there's probably, every week,

854
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,040
 there's a girl who comes up, and you know

855
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,400
 you need to break up with that guy.

856
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,680
 And you're not, you may not after tonight,

857
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,800
 you probably won't.

858
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,480
 And you go, look, I know it's wrong, he's not a believer,

859
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,080
 and look, we're sleeping together, and it's okay.

860
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,200
 But look, there's no storms!

861
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,660
 And Jesus says, look, you are paving a foundation

862
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,960
 that's going to crumble.

863
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,880
 Don't deceive yourself.

864
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,240
 I'm not any more angry at you, I love you.

865
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,580
 Will you come, and will you experience the protection

866
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,760
 of following my will, following my way?

867
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,880
 Some of you guys are living outside of the bounds at work.

868
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,620
 You're living with, you just moved in together.

869
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,880
 And you don't win, you don't go against God's design

870
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,720
 and win.

871
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,280
 Last week, 100 or 200 of you guys raised your hand

872
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,760
 and said, hey, look, I want to follow Jesus.

873
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,120
 And the best thing for you, we're so glad you guys are here.

874
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
 Like, attending is great, it's a great thing,

875
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,720
 it's not the thing.

876
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,860
 Jesus says, attending to hear my word,

877
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,560
 or even agreeing with my word, that doesn't make

878
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,080
 practical difference in your life.

879
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,440
 Applying it does.

880
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,460
 And if you want to experience the protection

881
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,200
 and the shelter that I want you to have,

882
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,340
 it will come from building your life on the rock

883
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,440
 of Christ and his word.

884
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,040
 And the best thing, if you're in that 200,

885
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,020
 is saying, I'm going all in.

886
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,760
 Whatever you're asking, God, the answer's yes.

887
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,340
 Whatever you would say and have me do, the answer is yes.

888
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,840
 I'm gonna choose to trust you.

889
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,240
 As I look at this application of how do we live out

890
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
 God's word, 'cause he says it's not, coming and hearing,

891
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,880
 don't be the person who just shows up,

892
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,940
 you got perfect church attendance, but doesn't apply it.

893
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,320
 The goal is practicing it, putting it in,

894
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,420
 living out God's word.

895
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,520
 How do we apply it?

896
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,560
 Here's what I know about you, 'cause I know it about me,

897
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,440
 is left to ourself, we just don't apply God's word

898
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,720
 to the fullness that we could.

899
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,660
 Maybe you're the type A, super disciplined person,

900
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,400
 and we just all applaud you.

901
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,240
 But for the rest of us mere mortals,

902
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,160
 we all need accountability, we need people around us

903
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,000
 to encourage us.

904
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,920
 That's why we encourage community so much here.

905
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,960
 Like we're crazy about it, 'cause that's where people

906
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,720
 begin to grow, when we gather together.

907
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,840
 Every person on our staff is in a community group

908
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,920
 where you meet together every week, you lock arms

909
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,960
 and you go, I need you, you need me,

910
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,840
 we're gonna help each other, I'm not going to let you

911
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,360
 build your house on sand, I'm gonna help you build it

912
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,240
 on the rock, I'm gonna point you back to Christ.

913
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,960
 When you keep moving that house out of sand,

914
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,200
 I'm gonna come grab you, I'm gonna walk alongside you,

915
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,440
 and we're gonna help each other walk through this life.

916
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,520
 God designed you to live inside of that community.

917
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,080
 If you don't have community, I don't know if you have

918
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,000
 a chance at living out God's word, partly 'cause that's

919
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,320
 one of the instructions in there.

920
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,640
 And the application for so many, 40% of you guys,

921
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,520
 we know at least, don't have a community group

922
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,320
 or a small group at your church or a group of people

923
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,640
 around you to help lift up the house when the storm

924
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,760
 feels like, or when there's a storm coming by

925
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,920
 and shaking it.

926
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,080
 And the best thing that you can do is tonight,

927
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,280
 mark your calendars, September 9th, next Wednesday night,

928
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,640
 there is the first chance to begin to step into

929
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,240
 a community group, get into a small group here,

930
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,040
 or do it at your church.

931
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,560
 If you don't have a home church and you're like,

932
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,680
 no, stick it to the man, I don't wanna be a guard

933
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,760
 of the membership class here, go to open community group

934
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,160
 tonight, or just grab like six guys around you,

935
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,720
 be like, do you know Jesus, can we meet together right now?

936
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,920
 Do that, whatever you have to do to get inside

937
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,080
 a community group, because we all know you won't change.

938
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,600
 You won't build your life on a firm foundation.

939
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,680
 Apart from that, and the step of beginning to apply,

940
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,200
 not be hearers, but doers, maybe that.

941
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,920
 Some of you may need to learn God's word.

942
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,400
 We have a Quip disciple coming up this fall.

943
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
 Go to watermark.org, look up a Quip disciple,

944
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
 they will teach you the Bible, they'll teach it to you.

945
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,000
 They'll give you that next step towards applying

946
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,680
 and living out God's word.

947
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,400
 I'll close here, I saw this past week,

948
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,520
 last Sunday actually, I saw probably the

949
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,840
 most crazy example of just what it looks like

950
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,880
 to be built on God's word.

951
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,120
 I'd seen it, it was five o'clock on Sunday, last Sunday,

952
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,200
 and I pulled up to Watermark, and I was coming

953
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
 for a launch meeting, there's a five o'clock church service,

954
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,840
 so I got here in the full parking lot,

955
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,600
 and I pull around the parking lot, and everyone's inside,

956
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,920
 it's 5.07, and I see this man who's lying on his back

957
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,120
 on the ground, and there's a woman on top of him, screaming.

958
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,440
 And they're young, like early 50s.

959
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,920
 And I pull my car, and I park it, and I run out of the car,

960
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,920
 and she's screaming, "Please, someone do something,

961
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,400
 "he's dying, he's not breathing,

962
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,060
 "please, someone do something, he's dying,

963
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,600
 "he's not breathing."

964
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,160
 And I run over to the guy, and there's one of our

965
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,520
 parking volunteers, who runs up, and we kinda converge

966
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,800
 at the same time, and I've never seen anything

967
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,680
 like it before.

968
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,320
 His eyes are glazing over, and he's not breathing,

969
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,400
 there's no pulse, and we begin to do chest compressions,

970
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,720
 and that's not normal, I'm not like a CPR wizard,

971
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,680
 I'm pulling on lifeguard days, where you're like,

972
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,840
 trying to remember what to do, and begin pumping his chest.

973
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,820
 And he breathes, he breathes like four different times,

974
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,760
 and his eyes, he begins to turn purple,

975
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,120
 and she's screaming, "Please, my dad died two days ago,

976
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,400
 "don't let him die."

977
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,000
 And we keep doing CPR, and finally, the EMTs come,

978
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,280
 and we continue to pump, and 911 shows up,

979
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,280
 or an ambulance shows up, and he didn't make it.

980
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,760
 And it was like, a moment I honestly have never seen,

981
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
 I led a meeting after that, and I told them,

982
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,400
 it's like, messing with my heart, 'cause I know

983
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,560
 the sovereignty of God, and all that stuff,

984
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,600
 but it's still like, "Lord, as we're praying,

985
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,520
 "please, Lord, save him, don't let him go."

986
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:31,680
 And what happened, as his wife, who's now a widow,

987
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
 who just showed up for five o'clock service,

988
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,800
 like this wouldn't, like, "Oh, I saw this coming,

989
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,480
 "this is just a normal day, walking through."

990
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,120
 He's a healthy dude, Dallas Marathon Club,

991
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,440
 just did the Hotter Than Hell bike ride.

992
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,200
 Healthy dude, and he shows up, and he's walking,

993
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,400
 normal day, I mean, they don't see this coming,

994
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,840
 they've got plans still on the calendar at their house,

995
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,240
 that they'll never live out.

996
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,620
 Early 50s.

997
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:01,260
 And that night, what became clear is this couple

998
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,560
 was a couple who'd built their life

999
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,640
 on the rock of God's word.

1000
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
 Like, they were a part of this church body here,

1001
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,120
 they were surrounded immediately, man, it was so amazing,

1002
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,800
 by community all over their house,

1003
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
 their community group came over, they filled the fridge,

1004
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,280
 they covered errands the next week,

1005
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,880
 they mourned, they prayed, they cried with, they hugged,

1006
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,280
 they walked alongside.

1007
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,120
 And this couple had built their life

1008
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,720
 in the midst of the storm, I mean, for her,

1009
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,440
 that woman who's now saying, "I'm a widow,

1010
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
 "I just lost my dad, and now I'm losing my husband."

1011
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,520
 And the storms of life were coming and shaking,

1012
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
 and a few days later at the funeral,

1013
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,000
 this memorial service took place,

1014
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,360
 and he was really spoken about by everyone,

1015
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,000
 and they began to speak about his life,

1016
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,040
 and it became even clearer,

1017
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,100
 he was building his life on the rock.

1018
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,000
 Because what's weird at funerals is they just don't

1019
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,760
 celebrate the things that we celebrate

1020
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,140
 all the time with our lives.

1021
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,880
 Like, no one gets up at funeral and talks about someone,

1022
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,220
 and they're like, "Man, he had the greatest house,

1023
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,060
 "you should've seen this thing,

1024
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,840
 "Austin Stone everywhere, this supercar."

1025
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,440
 They just don't celebrate that.

1026
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,920
 They celebrated his love for Christ,

1027
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,760
 his relationship, and his love for his wife,

1028
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,080
 his love for his kids.

1029
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,940
 And then they spoke about his wife,

1030
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,880
 who had said the day before,

1031
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,840
 when she was asked, "How are you doing?"

1032
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,520
 She said, "I'm making it one step at a time, foot by foot."

1033
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,300
 As she's surrounded, being held up by community,

1034
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,360
 she built her life on the rock of God's word,

1035
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,920
 and the storm came,

1036
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,180
 and it didn't make it any easier to go through the storms,

1037
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,800
 but in the midst of all of it,

1038
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,120
 she was able to face that storm knowing,

1039
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,160
 my God is in the heavens, he's in control,

1040
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,420
 and how are you doing, how are you making it through?

1041
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,400
 She said, "I'm putting one foot in front of the other,

1042
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,180
 "walking by faith, and trusting him."

1043
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,020
 And I listened, and I'm like,

1044
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,960
 how do you have a response like that?

1045
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,700
 How, God, I wanna be able to respond

1046
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,500
 that in the midst of no matter what I face,

1047
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,560
 that I'm gonna go, the earth shakes beneath my feet,

1048
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,040
 and Lord, I don't want it to shake,

1049
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,720
 I don't wanna lose my wife, I really don't.

1050
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,520
 But Lord, I wanna have this foundation

1051
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,680
 that no matter what comes my way,

1052
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,460
 I wanna stand, I wanna follow you,

1053
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,120
 that I wanna live on the only rock that'll uphold me,

1054
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,640
 that no matter how much the world around me shakes,

1055
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,860
 that I can lean on the only rock that never changes,

1056
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,280
 Jesus, and Jesus's words, the one who's the same,

1057
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,280
 yesterday, today, and forever, he says,

1058
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,440
 and I'm the only place in the midst of a world,

1059
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,240
 and I hope you hear that tonight, that's so broken.

1060
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,960
 In an instant tonight, a phone call could change

1061
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,820
 everything for your world, in an instant,

1062
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,040
 not fear-mongering, a whole landscape

1063
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,340
 of even our country economy could change.

1064
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,880
 Where are you gonna put your hope?

1065
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,360
 Where are you gonna build your life?

1066
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,920
 You're gonna build it on the world around us,

1067
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,680
 on maintaining some lifestyle?

1068
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,800
 You're gonna build it on the only thing

1069
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,280
 that will never change, that will never fail,

1070
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,060
 that will never fall?

1071
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,560
 Jesus, in his words, and he says,

1072
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,120
 I'm inviting you now, will you build your life

1073
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,180
 because the storms are coming.

1074
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,800
 Some of you in this room are gonna have a child

1075
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,960
 that has trisomy 18, you're going to.

1076
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,960
 Some of you are gonna lose a spouse,

1077
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,320
 some of you may have a brain tumor right now, I may.

1078
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,720
 What am I gonna build my life on?

1079
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,800
 I mean, what other chance and option do we have?

1080
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,520
 Jesus says, look, anywhere else that's gonna crumble,

1081
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,280
 I'm not here to rip you off, I love you,

1082
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
 will you build your life on the only rock that will stand?

1083
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,720
 That's what she was doing, that's how in the midst of,

1084
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,400
 I can't even imagine pain.

1085
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,840
 I'm gonna trust you, God,

1086
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,040
 I'm gonna put one foot in front of the other.

1087
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,780
 I'm gonna trust you, I'm gonna keep moving forward,

1088
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,480
 and as the storms come, and they're coming,

1089
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,100
 will you listen and today begin to lay the bricks

1090
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,280
 that the earth gives way?

1091
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,200
 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

1092
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,000
 which we're in right now, I will not fear

1093
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,280
 because you are with me, you hold me,

1094
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
 you're the only thing that holds me,

1095
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,440
 and you, by building on your word,

1096
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,760
 you'll allow me to stand in the storm of this life,

1097
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,120
 and you will protect me from the storm of eternity

1098
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,880
 'cause I trust you.

1099
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,240
 Who are you gonna trust in?

1100
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,540
 Who are you gonna live and build your life on?

1101
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,360
 Will you take those steps to apply?

1102
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,880
 Community, that's why we harp on that,

1103
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,800
 'cause if all of you who weren't in community got in it,

1104
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,320
 you would take that step,

1105
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,920
 you'd have other pillars holding the house together.

1106
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,800
 Will you listen, and will we be hearers and doers?

1107
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,760
 Jesus finishes out the Sermon on the Mount,

1108
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,920
 and says this about the crowds.

1109
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,640
 When Jesus had finished saying these things,

1110
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,160
 the crowds were amazed at his teaching

1111
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,560
 because he taught as one who had authority

1112
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,080
 and not as their teachers of the law,

1113
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,300
 that he taught with this new radical, I am the rock.

1114
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,240
 My words are the rock.

1115
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,520
 Will you build on that?

1116
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,560
 And I promise that the world around you shakes,

1117
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,200
 I will hold you firm,

1118
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,720
 and you will stand through the storm.

1119
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,520
 I'm gonna pray that that would be the case for all of us

1120
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,240
 who know him, for those of us who don't to come to know him.

1121
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,600
 Father, we love you, and we thank you that you will.

1122
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,320
 Many of us love you, I should say.

1123
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,360
 And I think those of us who don't would if we knew you.

1124
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,640
 Father, I pray for just men and women

1125
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,680
 who are walking through storms right now,

1126
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:33,560
 that those words, where they can find hope,

1127
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,840
 and they can be anchored in the midst of the storm,

1128
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,880
 have this anchor of our soul that's holding onto us

1129
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,040
 as we hold onto it,

1130
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,840
 that you would raise their awareness of you in their life.

1131
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,760
 I pray for those right now

1132
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,640
 who are not building their life on the storm.

1133
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,360
 Would you, by your spirit, pierce through their heart,

1134
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,000
 move them in the direction of just the ways

1135
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,440
 their dating relationships,

1136
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,360
 their decisions as it relates to alcohol,

1137
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,960
 or a million other things,

1138
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,960
 where we're just prone to live outside of your will for us

1139
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,680
 and build a home that's gonna crumble.

1140
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,720
 Father, your hand would be heavy.

1141
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,440
 Would you protect us from the storms of life

1142
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,920
 by allowing in your grace us to receive the protection

1143
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,580
 that you've already promised

1144
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,100
 for those who will accept, heed, and receive your word?

1145
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,660
 I pray for this morning family,

1146
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,300
 who though they're standing firm on the rock,

1147
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,780
 and never changes, never shifts,

1148
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,900
 they're still standing in a storm and pain.

1149
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,820
 You're the God of comfort.

1150
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,980
 Would you comfort them?

1151
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,500
 We love you and we worship you now,

1152
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,260
 our cornerstone, our rock, our redeemer.

1153
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,100
 Amen.
