1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,040
 - All right, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,720
 We doing okay tonight?

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,560
 Let's go.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,200
 Hey, it's so good to be back here with you

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,360
 this Tuesday night.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,920
 Special shout out to everybody tuning in with us right now.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,040
 Wherever it is that you're watching,

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
 whether it's here this evening,

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,500
 at some point in the future,

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,600
 we're so glad that you would choose to be a part

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,040
 of what God is doing.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,800
 Man, it happens in Dallas,

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,000
 but it is happening around our nation

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,160
 and across the globe within your generation.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,360
 We love that God is, I mean, right now,

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,840
 like he is spiritually surging within the lives

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
 of young adults all over.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
 And we feel it, like I just felt it.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,840
 Did you feel that?

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,680
 Like in worship, there's something palpable in the room,

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
 and that's something that we want to be true in this space,

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
 that we would come,

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,740
 and we wouldn't just intellectually ascend

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,920
 and learn great things,

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,120
 and we wouldn't just get all caught up in our feels

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,000
 because it feels good to come in and emote a little bit,

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,920
 but we would actually find the unification

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
 of those two things,

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,820
 and we would experience God together because he's here.

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,800
 Often, it's just a matter of us waking up to that reality.

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,200
 So thanks for being here.

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,480
 Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,360
 that are tuning in,

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,360
 Porch Live Indy, Porch Live Boise, and Porch Live Midland.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,440
 Special shout out to you guys.

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,160
 Midland, we love them.

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,960
 Hey, I'm really excited for tonight.

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,440
 I don't want to waste much more time.

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,560
 Obviously, this setup is different than normal,

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,320
 and because last week, we cued

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,800
 that we're gonna do a little bit of a round table,

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
 a little, that we're gonna spend an evening

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
 just conversating about a topic

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
 we think is really important.

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,360
 And to help me with it,

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
 we've got a couple of special guests.

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,800
 We've got both Timothy Atik, TA, who you know,

49
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,440
 elder lead pastor here at Watermark Community Church,

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,280
 and then we have a very special guest

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,680
 returning to the Porch stage, Miss Brenna Blaine.

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
 Porch, would y'all do an excellent job

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,320
 of helping welcome both of them to the stage at this time?

54
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,040
 [audience cheering]

55
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
 Don't be shy.

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,280
 Y'all come on up.

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,320
 It's amazing.

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
 Great to see y'all.

59
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,720
 Y'all grab a seat, please.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,040
 Porch, here's where we're going this evening.

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,920
 We set this up last week for you

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,840
 that we wanted to take some time tonight,

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,080
 and we wanted to really have a conversation

64
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,800
 about something that is deeply relevant to our current day.

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,960
 We want to talk to you about sexuality.

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
 And the reason why we want to do it

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,520
 is because here at the Porch,

68
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,280
 we not only want to be relevant

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,680
 because we want to be cool or we want to be current,

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
 we want to be relevant because we want to be heard,

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
 and we want to be helpful to you.

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,400
 We realize that this is a subject

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,160
 that meets many of you right where you are.

74
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
 And so we wanted to take an evening

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
 to really dedicate specific time

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,680
 to working our way through it.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 And in order to do so,

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,600
 I thought it'd be really helpful

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,760
 to have some friends join me.

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
 TA is here because we believe that this subject

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,160
 is one that shouldn't just be preached about from the stage,

82
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,800
 but it should be pastored from the floor.

83
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,640
 And he's here as an expression of Watermark's love

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,720
 for those of you in the room

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,160
 that maybe this is a part of your story

86
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,920
 or it's the part of someone's story that you know.

87
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,280
 And this is just our declaration to say,

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,280
 man, we want to walk with you through these types of issues.

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
 We don't want to just preach about them.

90
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,000
 We really want to shepherd you along the way.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
 So TA, thanks for being here.

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
 And then Brenna is here

93
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,240
 because this is very much an authentic part

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,640
 of her experience.

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,080
 And so Brenna, if you would,

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
 I know that some people are familiar with you already.

97
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,000
 It was awesome to see that there's some response

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
 just because you were here not even six months ago or so.

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,640
 And we had the joy of spending time with you then,

100
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,480
 but would you mind just catching everyone else up

101
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,440
 that hasn't had the chance

102
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,960
 to just learn a little bit about who you are

103
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,800
 and what your story is

104
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,400
 and why this subject is specifically something

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,920
 you've steeped yourself in study over

106
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,040
 and you've spent time looking at the scriptures for?

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
 - Yeah.

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
 - Awesome.

109
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,680
 - Well, like Kylan said, my name is Brenna.

110
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,320
 I'm 29 years old.

111
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,200
 And I think one of the two most important things about me

112
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,680
 is that I am a wife and I am a mom

113
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,680
 to two little but big energy boys

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,400
 that I just deeply love.

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,400
 And in my job, I get to be a contemporary theologian.

116
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,280
 And that's such a crazy thing to say.

117
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,240
 But I did not get there easily.

118
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,160
 I had to wrestle through some pretty significant suffering

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,920
 and complex things to get there.

120
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,080
 And one of the most informative things

121
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,080
 that I walked through was I was born into a pastor's home.

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,720
 I'm a PK.

123
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,440
 And that would have been really great for me,

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,440
 except I realized in my early teens

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,400
 that I am in fact attracted to the same sex.

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,400
 And I knew that made me incompatible

127
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,600
 with the person of Christ,

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
 or at least that's what I thought in that place.

129
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,880
 And so it took a lot of questioning

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,880
 and I think even running from God

131
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,160
 that the Lord used that to bring me back to him.

132
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,040
 I still struggle with same sex attraction.

133
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,560
 That's a temptation that has not been taken away from me.

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,480
 But I believe in the faithfulness

135
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,680
 and the goodness of the Holy Spirit.

136
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,680
 And so I sit humbly before you all today

137
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,760
 that the Lord has allowed me to be here

138
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,840
 to share parts of what I've learned

139
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,440
 and what I've gone through.

140
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,280
 The very first song we sang tonight,

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,360
 I actually became super overwhelmed emotionally

142
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
 because I ran far away from God

143
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,080
 and I kind of physically ran away from God.

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,520
 When I graduated, when I was a high schooler,

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,480
 I moved to Maui, Hawaii,

146
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,240
 because all I wanted to do was smoke weed,

147
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,480
 date hot women, and surf.

148
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,000
 And so I went there to do that,

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,240
 but I went there under the guise of being a missionary

150
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,880
 because I couldn't afford to get myself to Maui.

151
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,320
 So I applied for this missions program,

152
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,160
 got accepted 'cause I grew up in the church

153
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
 and knew how to use Christian language,

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,000
 flew into the church,

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,760
 knew how to use Christian language,

156
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,480
 flew under the radar, ended up there,

157
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,760
 and got radically saved by the Lord.

158
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,800
 And I remember I had to go home for my brother's wedding,

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,320
 not very far into that stay.

160
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,720
 I flew home and I remember thinking,

161
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,040
 my parents and everyone around me

162
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,800
 are going to be shocked.

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 Um, because I'd faked it for so long

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,240
 and was so convinced that everyone else was faking it too.

165
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,120
 And the moment that I met the Lord,

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,440
 that was so transformative.

167
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,400
 And I remember being home,

168
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,960
 about to go to my brother's wedding,

169
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
 I was upstairs in my bathroom and that song came on.

170
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,640
 And I felt full of the Holy Spirit

171
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,760
 for the first time in my life.

172
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,760
 And so to have that song play and be standing there

173
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,680
 and thinking about what God has done

174
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,680
 over the last 10 years has just been incredibly humbling

175
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
 and blows my mind.

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,960
 So thanks for letting me go on a tangent there.

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,540
 (congregation applauding)

178
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:42,600
 - I mean, I think that even that is just a testament

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,160
 to the fact that like this,

180
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,480
 yes, we have planned for this moment.

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,040
 And yet, as we were talking about earlier,

182
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
 like we really want to be sensitive

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,440
 to the way in which the Spirit of God moves in this space.

184
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,200
 We wanna be in inviting people to His work here.

185
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,640
 And the fact that that connects so like,

186
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,400
 it connects to such an important and pivotal moment

187
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,120
 in your story of grace is really amazing.

188
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,400
 It's as if the Spirit sees what we're doing right now.

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,400
 So I'm really eager to get into this a little bit more

190
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
 and I'm really glad you're here.

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,200
 Brenna, I think that your story probably resonates

192
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
 with someone in the room.

193
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,920
 And if it doesn't resonate with someone personally,

194
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,580
 it will resonate with someone in the sense

195
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,080
 that they know someone that it resonates with.

196
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,400
 So there's really no one here that can see,

197
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,800
 can feel in themselves, this is irrelevant.

198
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,640
 Like this is a wildly relevant issue,

199
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,960
 not just in our culture, but to us at an individual level.

200
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,340
 For those that are resonating with it, I'm just curious,

201
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,360
 can you speak to, is their sexual orientation a sin

202
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,680
 or is it part of how God created them to be?

203
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,280
 - Yeah, I mean, my first thing,

204
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,000
 and to just be transparent with everyone,

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,040
 I'm a huge manuscripter.

206
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,400
 I take notes, so we talked through these questions

207
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,680
 beforehand, so I'm gonna be reading through my notes

208
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
 so I can give you my absolute best.

209
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,120
 But my first question is, who's asking the question

210
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,040
 and what are they struggling with?

211
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,240
 You can have a sexual orientation

212
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,560
 that is part of how God created you

213
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,760
 and parts of that orientation can be sinful.

214
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
 So an example would be a young woman

215
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,840
 who is attracted to men.

216
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,840
 That is the God-created and ordained model of attraction

217
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,880
 that we have been given.

218
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,880
 However, post-fall, sin enters the world and lust does too.

219
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,320
 And I think something that's interesting

220
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,480
 when I was thinking through this question

221
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 is a world without lust is so foreign to us

222
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,120
 that I think even as Christians,

223
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,520
 especially single Christians,

224
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,520
 we do not recognize the microforms of lust

225
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,560
 in our life as lust.

226
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,560
 Like, I often wonder where attraction would stop

227
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,240
 or what the depth of attraction would be

228
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
 as a single person pre-fall, if that makes sense.

229
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 And so people with God-created orientations

230
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,160
 can still struggle with sin within that.

231
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,720
 And then another example is a sexual orientation

232
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,100
 that exists as a result of the fall.

233
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,460
 So your sexual desires have been disordered

234
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,880
 because of what has happened.

235
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,880
 So those orientations would be any attraction

236
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,520
 that falls outside of the marriage mandate,

237
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,440
 which is one man, one woman for life.

238
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,460
 So examples of this would be,

239
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,320
 like myself attracted to the same sex.

240
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,180
 I don't believe God created me that way.

241
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,760
 It's a result of the fall.

242
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,620
 And if, I mean, it feels cheeky saying this,

243
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,640
 but I actually believe it.

244
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,640
 If you are a serial dater, God didn't create you that way.

245
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,960
 And that is a result of the fall.

246
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,600
 And if you find yourself bored of your spouse

247
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,160
 after 15 years, God still did not create you that way.

248
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,440
 And that's a result of the fall.

249
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,280
 So if your sexual appetite tells you,

250
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,040
 I need a new experience or a new person

251
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,520
 or new experiences with new people

252
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,520
 or with a screen or a book to light up my imagination,

253
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,680
 God didn't create you that way.

254
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,160
 And that is a result of the fall.

255
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,420
 - So would you say that it's right to say

256
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,720
 that a same sex orientation or a same sex attraction

257
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,320
 is not sin, but it is a result of the fall?

258
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
 - Yeah. - Okay.

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,320
 But we would say that same sex lust

260
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,680
 or same sex action would be sin.

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,600
 - Yeah. - Right?

262
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
 - Yeah. - Okay, that's really helpful.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,960
 Now, Tia, I'd love to speak with you for a moment

264
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
 and ask you, 'cause I think this is,

265
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
 it's helpful to know, okay,

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
 my same sex orientation is a result of the fall.

267
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,120
 Then what is the result in our identity through redemption?

268
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
 Does that make sense?

269
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,480
 Even what we were visiting about earlier today,

270
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
 now that we're in Christ, what is the impact of that

271
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,360
 when it comes to the way we look at our life

272
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,400
 and the things that we actually identify with

273
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,320
 and how we process the circumstances

274
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
 or feelings that we have?

275
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,960
 - Yeah.

276
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,600
 Well, I think, you know, the thing,

277
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,440
 the wrestle that I feel when I'm trying to talk to people

278
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,440
 about what God believes about them and their sexuality

279
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,200
 is that the message that people believe

280
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,320
 is the truest thing about me is my sexuality.

281
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,280
 Like, that's the truest thing about me.

282
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,000
 And I would say that in Christ,

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,520
 that is not even close to being the truest thing about you.

284
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,200
 Like, the truest thing about me

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,440
 is not that I am a heterosexual married man.

286
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,320
 The truest thing about me in Christ

287
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,840
 is that I am a child of God.

288
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,040
 Like, there is nothing that is truer,

289
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
 and there is nothing more definite and constant

290
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
 than that truth.

291
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,320
 Because here's the reality.

292
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,240
 I might not always be married.

293
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
 Let me clarify what I'm saying.

294
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
 My wife could, my wife, heaven forbid,

295
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
 my wife could die tomorrow, and I am now a widower.

296
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,240
 So, like, that status changes.

297
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,600
 The thing that is truest about me,

298
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,200
 my identity, is that I'm a child of God.

299
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,560
 That's what Christ has done.

300
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,600
 He didn't just come to save us from hell.

301
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,800
 He came to save us into a family

302
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,560
 where we now know God as Father.

303
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,080
 Not everyone is a child of God.

304
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,720
 You're either a child of wrath or a child of God.

305
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,800
 Christ makes us children of God.

306
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,320
 And so, I think the lie that people believe

307
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,480
 is that the truest thing about me is my sexuality.

308
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,040
 Therefore, my sexuality must define me,

309
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,760
 and my sexuality must drive me.

310
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,160
 And that's just not true.

311
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,640
 Like, as a child of God, that's what defines me.

312
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,000
 So, the question that I have to ask and answer

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,560
 is what does it look like for me to take my orders

314
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,640
 from my heavenly Father?

315
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,560
 What does it look like for me to embody

316
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,320
 the family values of God?

317
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,520
 And what does it look like for that to define me

318
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,320
 and to drive me?

319
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,360
 And as a heterosexual married man,

320
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,840
 like, that requires consistent surrender to that identity.

321
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,600
 Like, Brenna and I, we're on the same journey every day

322
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,400
 with the same decision if we're going to live within,

323
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,320
 if we're gonna live out the truest thing about us.

324
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,160
 - That's good.

325
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
 - I think there are a lot of people here

326
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,480
 that wherever they are with respect to this issue

327
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,240
 would say, "Yes, like, I want that.

328
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,040
 "Like, I want to live out the truest aspect of my identity,

329
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,440
 "but God, why won't you make that easier?"

330
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,840
 Like, there's some people here that have surely prayed,

331
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,680
 Brenna, what I'm sure is the prayer you've prayed yourself,

332
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,000
 which is like, "God, why won't you take this away?"

333
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,880
 What would you say to the person that is praying

334
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,040
 for God to take this away and it hasn't happened yet?

335
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,880
 - Yeah.

336
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,520
 With all the examples I gave about broken orientations,

337
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,920
 in those orientations with those desires,

338
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,160
 you can have those temptations without it being a sin,

339
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,400
 right, like we talked, we touched on that.

340
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,200
 You can have a disordered sexual desire

341
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,320
 without giving into this.

342
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,760
 And I think it's first really important to ask,

343
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,120
 where do we see that in the biblical text?

344
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,360
 If it's true, where do we see that?

345
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
 In both Matthew 4, one through 11,

346
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,560
 and then Luke 4, one through 13, it says,

347
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,840
 "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness

348
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,880
 "to be tempted by the devil."

349
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,520
 So the first question is, did Jesus sin?

350
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,600
 No.

351
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 The second question is, was Jesus tempted?

352
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,200
 And in Galatians, it says, "But the fruit of the Spirit

353
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,240
 "is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

354
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,600
 "faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

355
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,160
 "Against such things there are no law."

356
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 And so there's this argument that lives

357
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 within some faith cultures that say,

358
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,400
 same-sex attracted people need to see a decrease

359
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,240
 or a complete removal of their same-sex attraction

360
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,920
 or temptation in order to lead in the church

361
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,920
 or even to be seen as spiritually healthy or mature.

362
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,000
 And I don't see that in the text.

363
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 What I do see is this sign for spiritual health

364
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,520
 and maturity that is the Holy Spirit

365
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,900
 is taking over more of your thoughts

366
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,840
 and more of your actions,

367
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,880
 and that is what we define as self-control.

368
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,080
 And so I think it's interesting that in this case,

369
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,240
 with this thought, the fruit of the Spirit isn't

370
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,240
 and the diminishing of temptation, but self-control,

371
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,240
 indicating that if these things persist,

372
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,680
 so if you've been praying for your same-sex attraction

373
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,680
 to be taken away and it hasn't been and it persists,

374
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,800
 or even if there are seasons where the temptation grows,

375
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,920
 that in itself does not disqualify you.

376
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,560
 The question doesn't lie in what is the percentage

377
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,200
 of your current temptation,

378
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 but rather what is your dependence on the Holy Spirit?

379
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
 Christ was greatly tempted.

380
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,800
 Now I love, in Philippians, it's 2, 6 through 8,

381
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,240
 it says, "Who being in very nature God

382
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,740
 "did not consider equality with God

383
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,620
 "something to be used to his own advantage.

384
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,500
 "Rather, he made himself nothing

385
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,980
 "by taking the very nature of a servant

386
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,980
 "being made in human likeness,

387
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,720
 "and being found in appearance as a man,

388
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,000
 "he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death,

389
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,640
 "even death on a cross."

390
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,640
 So there's this complex theological idea happening here

391
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,160
 that Jesus, while retaining his full divinity,

392
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,720
 set aside the privilege of his divinity and deity,

393
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 and Christ assumes humanity to his divinity.

394
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,800
 So the reason why this matters is that people hear

395
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,280
 that Christ was tempted,

396
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,200
 and it's easy for us to assume

397
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,200
 it didn't have any weight on him because of his deity,

398
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,280
 but here Christ sets that aside.

399
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,280
 And so Christ not sinning when he was tempted

400
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:35,480
 is not like an athlete using steroids.

401
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,400
 I think that's often the thought.

402
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,480
 He has this superhuman extra boost,

403
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,240
 but Christ not sinning, what it's actually like

404
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,520
 in the face of temptation, is more like an athlete

405
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,520
 who has chosen not to consume ultra-processed food.

406
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,160
 He didn't use a superhuman ability.

407
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,960
 It's actually that he chose not to participate

408
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,600
 in the sin that degrades humanity,

409
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
 doling out and dampening the leading

410
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,680
 of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

411
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,880
 And so if that's true, if Christ being fully God

412
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,800
 stepped into being also fully human,

413
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 we have to ask how did he face such horrific temptation

414
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,520
 and do it faithfully?

415
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,320
 And the answer we see is in the beginning

416
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,640
 of all four Gospels, which is when Jesus is baptized,

417
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,120
 he comes out of the water, and what happens?

418
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,320
 The Holy Spirit descends on him.

419
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 And the crazy thing is that gift is available

420
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,880
 to all of us, and so if you have been praying

421
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,440
 for God to take this temptation away from you,

422
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,780
 and Kylan already said it, but I have prayed that prayer.

423
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,320
 There were four years of my life

424
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,320
 where I prayed that prayer every single night.

425
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,220
 You need to know that if his answer is no,

426
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,380
 or if his answer is not yet,

427
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 that the Holy Spirit was not just sufficient,

428
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,340
 but immeasurably more for Christ,

429
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,620
 and therefore is immeasurably more for you,

430
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,780
 no matter what your temptation is.

431
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,740
 And I love in Corinthians, Paul addresses temptation.

432
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740
 In the first part, he just says,

433
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,380
 "No temptation has overtaken you

434
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,020
 "except what is common to man."

435
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,940
 And in that part, he's saying,

436
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,940
 "If you are tempted, no matter what it is, it's normal."

437
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,960
 You might have the thought in your brain

438
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,860
 that you're like, oh, no one else struggles with this.

439
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,740
 And that is a tool of Satan to keep you isolated

440
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,260
 from sharing in community.

441
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,900
 Your temptation is not unique to you.

442
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,180
 Everyone has struggled with something.

443
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,580
 And then Paul goes on and says,

444
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,880
 "And God is faithful.

445
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,380
 "He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear,

446
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,540
 "but when you are tempted,

447
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,540
 "he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it."

448
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,700
 This is written to the church in Corinth.

449
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,300
 Corinth is a huge port city

450
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 that is inundated with sexual misconduct.

451
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,660
 One of the main things that took place in Corinth

452
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,340
 was temple worship.

453
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,240
 And one of the main temples there

454
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,380
 was the Temple of Aphrodite.

455
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,420
 And the way you worshiped in that temple was through sex.

456
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,420
 Any and every sexual engagement you can imagine

457
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,780
 was taking place in the city.

458
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,780
 Now, also, this was not frowned upon.

459
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,340
 This was widely known.

460
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,300
 And if you came into money in this point in time,

461
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,020
 it would be a very normal brag and thing to do

462
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,020
 to say, I am going to worship at the Temple of Aphrodite.

463
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,020
 And everyone knew what you were talking about.

464
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,220
 But Paul is talking to a church

465
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,860
 that has been established in this very city.

466
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,980
 And he's saying these things

467
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,720
 because earlier he talks about this list of sins

468
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,780
 that I think many of us have heard,

469
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,380
 including sexual immorality and homosexuality,

470
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,220
 and he's saying,

471
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:59,380
 as some of you once were,

472
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,820
 and I love that phrase

473
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,140
 because it's like Paul is writing to this church

474
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,020
 remembering before you loved God,

475
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,860
 you were worshiping at this temple every single night.

476
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,940
 And so you can imagine,

477
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,880
 we've all struggled with temptations

478
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,780
 that we needed to seek accountability for.

479
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,980
 And I think a lot of the times accountability for us

480
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,500
 includes removal or distance.

481
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,380
 You can imagine being people in Corinth

482
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,020
 who struggled with those things,

483
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,460
 who came to know the Lord,

484
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,080
 and then decided we have to be Christians in this city.

485
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,500
 And what temptation that would present itself.

486
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,840
 That every single day you are seeing

487
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,060
 the people of your past life that you used to live with.

488
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,340
 And they're probably saying,

489
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,820
 hey, why don't you just come join us again?

490
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,860
 Hey, what happened?

491
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,580
 Hey, why aren't you going out with us?

492
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,180
 And Paul doesn't say,

493
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,620
 yeah, get up and leave the city.

494
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,620
 He says, the Holy Spirit is sufficient for you.

495
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,860
 So I think we have to understand

496
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,060
 that our temptation is understood

497
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,480
 because Christ was tempted.

498
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 And we are not left to ourselves to battle ourselves.

499
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,980
 We have the Holy Spirit to lean on in that.

500
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:47,980
 - I can imagine the thought of

501
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,500
 daily surrendering, right?

502
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,300
 Constantly, consistently, continually taking my desires

503
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,560
 and putting them at the altar can feel like,

504
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,860
 okay, here I go again.

505
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,460
 I'm always having to give something up

506
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,460
 in order to get you, Jesus.

507
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,220
 I'm always having to give something over

508
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,180
 in order to receive the kind of life you want.

509
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,100
 And it can feel really taxing.

510
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,260
 TA, we were talking a little bit about this earlier today.

511
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,360
 And so I'd love to just ask if you could speak briefly

512
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,900
 into why is, surrender is not,

513
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:27,860
 it's not a disincentivizing proposition.

514
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,040
 Like it's actually a great invitation.

515
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
 Why is that?

516
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,100
 Like why is it that when I surrender myself to Jesus,

517
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,180
 it's not just I'm giving over, I guess what I want.

518
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,640
 It's actually instead a really beautiful exchange.

519
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,700
 - Yeah, we always think of surrender as giving something up,

520
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,860
 which it is.

521
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,440
 It's laying our lives down.

522
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,020
 The call is to come and die.

523
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,880
 And yet so often we're looking at what we have to give up

524
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,020
 and we're never looking at what we actually get to embrace.

525
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,660
 And so, like if you struggle with some same sex attraction

526
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,140
 in Brenna, this is where you can help,

527
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,420
 but you're not just constantly saying,

528
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,020
 I don't get to have that.

529
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,420
 Like there has to, and this isn't just

530
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,000
 for same sex attraction.

531
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 This is for any desire that is contrary

532
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,660
 to what God wants for you right now.

533
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,660
 So it's so easy to just focus on what God is asking you

534
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,100
 to give up instead of what he's inviting you to embrace.

535
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:42,020
 And I think the reality is that,

536
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 the reality is that God wants us to be satisfied in him.

537
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,700
 He wants us to be satisfied in him.

538
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,340
 I was talking with a friend earlier

539
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,880
 and we were talking about this,

540
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,560
 we were talking about same sex attraction,

541
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,000
 same sex relationships.

542
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,280
 And one of the ways he put it was,

543
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,100
 in this circumstance, God has told us no.

544
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,340
 And he related it to his kids.

545
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,640
 Like if his kids ask for something

546
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,840
 and he tells them no, like,

547
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,320
 hey dad, I wanna go and spend the night

548
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,420
 at this person's house.

549
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,480
 I know you want to, but you can't.

550
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,320
 The answer is no.

551
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,020
 But dad, I really want to.

552
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,380
 Yeah, but the answer is no.

553
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,560
 But dad, you don't understand.

554
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,220
 No, I do understand, but the answer is no.

555
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,740
 And a question that he's asked his kids is,

556
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,740
 what is keeping you from letting me tell you no?

557
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,380
 Which I think is a really interesting question.

558
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,580
 Like, what's keeping you from letting me tell you no?

559
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,340
 And I think what it comes down to,

560
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,060
 and this is just the Christian life.

561
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,680
 One of the reasons that we have a hard time

562
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,680
 letting God tell us no is that we aren't convinced

563
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,780
 that if we let him tell us no,

564
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,780
 that in the end he will be good enough in himself for us.

565
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,680
 And that's for all of life.

566
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,700
 Like, there's gonna be times in our lives

567
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,140
 where God tells us no.

568
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,220
 That you might be battling chronic pain,

569
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,220
 and you pray for healing, and God tells you no.

570
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,780
 And we, our tendency is to say,

571
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,240
 well then God isn't good because he doesn't heal.

572
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,760
 And yet, what if it is through that pain

573
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,620
 that God wants you to taste and see that he's good

574
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,500
 in a way that you wouldn't if he did just

575
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,340
 heal you like that?

576
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,100
 And so that's where we all, as followers of Jesus Christ,

577
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,360
 that's what faith looks like.

578
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,260
 If we just wanna boil it down,

579
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,260
 faith in Christ is believing that God is good enough

580
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:03,100
 to tell you no and to give you himself,

581
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,020
 and it makes that no good.

582
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,060
 - Yeah, that's right.

583
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,860
 I remember I had a seminary professor

584
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,500
 who once said, and I think I've shared this in here before,

585
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,940
 but God will lead you places you would not go

586
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,520
 to teach you things you need to know.

587
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,340
 And I was like, well that sounds horrible.

588
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,660
 Can't you find another way to teach me, God?

589
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,740
 There's a litany of things that he wants to teach you.

590
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,620
 Some of you, it's not even in this issue,

591
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,580
 but it's in some area of suffering or difficulty right now,

592
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,260
 and you need to know, man, God is trying to teach you

593
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,620
 more about himself by way of whatever that thing is.

594
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,620
 But, and I think, T.A., you just summarized it perfectly,

595
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,740
 what God is trying to lead you to

596
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,000
 is the knowledge that he's better.

597
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,940
 It's not even like, I guess he's good enough.

598
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,380
 It's that he is better.

599
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,060
 He's better than whatever else it is you want.

600
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,940
 Now, some people here that are struggling

601
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,140
 with same-sex attraction or finding themselves

602
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,500
 in even potentially a same-sex relationship would say,

603
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,780
 okay, but can't I have my cake and eat it too?

604
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,700
 Can't I walk with Jesus and also continue

605
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,060
 to be in a same-sex relationship?

606
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,380
 And Brenna, I would love if you could speak to that question

607
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,260
 'cause I think that that's probably

608
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,660
 the most important question we could ask tonight

609
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,180
 is is it possible to be in a same-sex relationship

610
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,140
 and still live a Christian life?

611
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,140
 And I just wanna give you permission.

612
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,100
 You can take as much time as you want on this one

613
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,420
 because I think that this one is,

614
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,680
 it deserves as much time as you think it actually needs.

615
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
 So what do you think?

616
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,100
 Is it possible to be in a same-sex relationship

617
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,140
 and still live a Christian life?

618
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,860
 - Yeah, this is where I took the most time with my notes.

619
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,620
 So we're gonna go down a rabbit trail

620
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:51,420
 because I think it's extremely important

621
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,060
 that we actually do the work.

622
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,860
 - We're good with that, yes?

623
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,420
 All right, let's go, let's do it.

624
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,300
 - So I would wager a high percentage of people in this room

625
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,580
 already had an answer to that question

626
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,140
 in your head when you asked it.

627
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:13,140
 What I would not wager is the percentage of yes versus no

628
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:19,460
 because for those of us in this room

629
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,900
 who are between the ages of 20 and 30,

630
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,900
 we've already established that this is a personal question.

631
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:33,300
 We either love someone who's same-sex attracted,

632
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,420
 we are someone who is same-sex attracted,

633
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,700
 or we've been confronted about our beliefs on sexuality

634
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,700
 because someone knows that we at least frequent church.

635
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,420
 And so already there are layers to this question

636
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,940
 that I think deserves walking through.

637
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,940
 So the first layer is what is a Christian life?

638
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,460
 What is a Christian life?

639
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,460
 There are plenty of Christians who are in

640
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,220
 what I would call habitual sin.

641
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,900
 They're having sex outside of marriage,

642
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,620
 they are chronically domineering,

643
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,620
 they're intrinsically greedy.

644
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,340
 We all have heard the stories

645
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,620
 or maybe have been personally impacted by pastors

646
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,620
 who are harsh or quarrelsome or abusive.

647
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,260
 And what's confusing is that you can appear on the outside

648
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:41,060
 as someone who loves Jesus.

649
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,020
 You can go to church every Sunday,

650
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,940
 you can know the Bible, you can even preach the Bible

651
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,620
 and talk about what it says, but so deceive yourselves,

652
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,620
 as it says in James, into thinking that Christianity

653
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:03,180
 is a list of actions weighed.

654
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,420
 It's a checklist that you have to go through

655
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,340
 when really that thought that I just have to show up

656
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,500
 to church, read my Bible, do these things,

657
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,940
 is either just a product of religious guilt,

658
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,700
 which is not a fruit of the Holy Spirit.

659
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,700
 We are compelled by love and relationship

660
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:33,900
 to do those things, not compelled by guilt

661
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,340
 or something you were taught or shamed into.

662
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,340
 Or those actions are the guise of moral superiority

663
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,060
 and both groups miss the fact that it is not

664
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,980
 about prescriptions but compelled by Christ's radical love.

665
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,860
 So you can be a cultural Christian and reasonably

666
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,860
 or even unknowingly unsubscribe to whatever parts

667
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:06,940
 of the text that don't satisfy or serve your flesh

668
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,220
 because you are not being ruled by the Holy Spirit,

669
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,180
 but rather being deceived that relationship

670
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,140
 with Christ is only moral obligation.

671
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,180
 But to follow Jesus, that's a whole 'nother story.

672
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,940
 I love in Mark chapter two, Jesus is walking

673
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,500
 with a crowd and he's teaching them.

674
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,260
 And up along the way, they see Levi, the tax collector,

675
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,060
 and tax collectors were greatly hated

676
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,380
 by the Jewish majority because they were seen as traitors

677
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,140
 because they were raised Jewish

678
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,100
 and decided to start working for Rome

679
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,100
 and they would often use their power of working for Rome

680
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,660
 to abuse their fellow Jews by taking more money.

681
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,060
 And so I can imagine as this crowd is walking with Jesus,

682
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,460
 they see this tax collector up in front of them

683
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,460
 and they're thinking, Jesus is going to call this guy out

684
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,540
 because he is living in sin.

685
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,620
 He is daily abusing the people of God.

686
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,900
 So that thought makes sense when they're walking

687
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,860
 with this teacher who's known

688
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,940
 for some pretty radical interactions.

689
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,780
 But what happens I think is not only shocking

690
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,420
 to the Jewish people who were with Jesus at the time,

691
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,420
 but probably deeply shocking to Levi as well.

692
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,620
 And Christ walks to him and says two words, follow me.

693
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:53,380
 And when you read ahead, you get to this part

694
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:57,500
 where it says Jesus is eating with sinners

695
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,820
 and tax collectors and you have to be thinking,

696
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,820
 how did he get there, right?

697
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,180
 Like, how did he get in this company?

698
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,180
 And I can't help but think that when the people in the town

699
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,900
 who were also on the outskirts of the religious majority,

700
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,460
 the people who have been shamed and beaten

701
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,420
 or mocked or disregarded,

702
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,420
 when they saw that Jesus approached Levi with compassion

703
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:36,060
 and not condemnation, that maybe they thought

704
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,340
 maybe this Jesus also wants to see me too.

705
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,140
 And so they have a meal together

706
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,700
 where Jesus gets to present himself the light

707
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,100
 and truth to these people.

708
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,100
 Now, the interesting thing is that following Jesus

709
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:04,060
 required Levi to decide to never go back to the church.

710
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,060
 He decided to never go back to that tax booth.

711
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,220
 The tax booth that he built,

712
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,420
 that was a place of comfort and ease

713
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,860
 and a good life that served his flesh.

714
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,860
 Levi could not follow Jesus

715
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,860
 if he did not leave that life behind.

716
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,220
 That was the decision.

717
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,540
 It's not just for those who are same-sex attracted.

718
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,100
 I think we've all built tax booths that we've dwelt in,

719
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,780
 that we've found comfort in, that we've benefited from.

720
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,780
 But to follow Jesus means to leave our self-desires

721
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,980
 behind us, understanding that following Christ

722
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,340
 on the narrow road leads us away from self-satisfaction,

723
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,220
 self-reliance and self-worship.

724
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,260
 But it also leads us closer and closer to the object

725
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,980
 of our affection and devotion.

726
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,980
 And the way that this walking, the narrow path,

727
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:15,500
 is described in the biblical text is first self-sacrifice.

728
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,340
 In Romans 12, when it says,

729
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,060
 "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,

730
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,060
 "in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies

731
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,860
 "as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God,

732
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,940
 "this is your true and proper worship."

733
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,820
 And it is also self-crucifixion.

734
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,860
 Luke 9, 23 says, "And he said to all,

735
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,540
 "if anyone would come after me, let him deny himself

736
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,460
 "and take up his cross daily and follow me."

737
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,060
 And then in Galatians 5, it says,

738
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,700
 "So I say, walk by the Spirit,

739
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,500
 "and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

740
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,500
 I find that people are commonly willing to accept

741
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,340
 that life with Jesus includes some amount

742
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,740
 of personal sacrifice, especially in places

743
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,260
 that match areas of secular moralism,

744
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,580
 like expending your time or your money

745
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,740
 or your talents for other people.

746
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,620
 But it is much harder to accept the idea

747
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,660
 that sacrifice in a crucified life

748
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,660
 would mean denying self-pleasure.

749
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,780
 So that's the second layer, is in your life,

750
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:46,020
 who gets to define right and wrong?

751
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,280
 Oftentimes, there's this interjection

752
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,680
 that says, "I'm caring for the oppressed,

753
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,120
 "I'm loving my neighbor, I'm even turning the other cheek."

754
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,680
 But these verses couldn't possibly mean

755
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,000
 denying myself the desire I feel

756
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,560
 if it isn't harmful to any other person involved.

757
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,400
 Right, if it's monogamous and loving,

758
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,160
 it can't mean that I would have to deny myself that.

759
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,040
 And Dr. Preston Sprinkle says,

760
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,360
 "The same Lord who said, 'Love everyone,'

761
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,140
 "also said, 'Don't lust, don't worry, don't hate,

762
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,500
 "'don't fornicate, don't be greedy, don't retaliate,'

763
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,940
 "and a whole host of other things that confronted,

764
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,520
 "not reaffirmed our desires.

765
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,520
 "The love everybody argument rightly prioritizes love,

766
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,280
 "but wrongly defines it.

767
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,000
 "Jesus tells us to love one another as I have loved you."

768
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,160
 And that last part is important.

769
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,260
 When Jesus loved his disciples,

770
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,920
 he didn't always or usually affirm

771
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,140
 their behaviors or desires.

772
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,200
 It's worldly love, not Christian love,

773
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,700
 that says, "Because I love you,

774
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,440
 "I'll affirm everything you desire to do

775
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,480
 "and everything you believe to be true about yourself."

776
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,160
 So the true recognition within these scriptures

777
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,480
 that talk about a crucified life

778
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,480
 is they aren't being spoken vaguely.

779
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,900
 They are attached to an entire body of God-breathed,

780
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,720
 inerrant, infallible scripture.

781
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,900
 So that means God makes it known to us

782
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,600
 what walking on the narrow path looks like.

783
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,640
 In John 14, Jesus tells his disciples,

784
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,640
 "Hey, if you love me, keep my commands."

785
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,600
 And James, I love how frankly James writes.

786
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,600
 He says, "Do not merely listen to the word

787
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,080
 "and so deceive yourselves.

788
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,160
 "Do what it says."

789
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,160
 So now we ask, what does the text say

790
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,120
 about sex, about romantic relationships,

791
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,820
 and about fornication?

792
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,420
 That's the third layer.

793
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,860
 And one of the answers I often hear is,

794
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,380
 Jesus had no framework

795
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,220
 for loving, monogamous, same-sex relationships.

796
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,280
 And so that's why Jesus never mentions

797
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,580
 same-sex relationships,

798
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,780
 but only mentions same-sex abuse.

799
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,140
 And the first thing to note

800
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,140
 is that adult men abusing teenage boys was common

801
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,420
 and also clearly condemned in ancient Jewish writings.

802
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,420
 However, there is also evidence in Jewish authors,

803
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,780
 that Jewish authors disapproved of all forms

804
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,060
 of same-sex sexual relations,

805
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,400
 not just exploitative ones.

806
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 We have a handful of ancient letters that say that,

807
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,840
 that reference also consensual same-sex acts

808
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,840
 without any indication of coercion or pedophilia

809
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,000
 showing a broader disapproval.

810
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,040
 And then often in the church,

811
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,200
 pastors will quote Josephus.

812
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,120
 So for example, Josephus condemns same-sex relationships

813
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,520
 in the context of marriage,

814
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,700
 emphasizing a natural male-female union.

815
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,200
 So one,

816
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,580
 the Bible's not just talking about abusive relationships

817
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,880
 or harmful relationships.

818
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,880
 And two, the question of same-sex monogamy in marriage,

819
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,240
 Jesus doesn't name that

820
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,400
 because whenever he's talking about marriage,

821
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,920
 it's assumed that he is upholding the God-ordained covenant

822
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,800
 that marriage inherently involves

823
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,200
 what has been cited and said in Genesis.

824
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,040
 In other words, Jesus is always affirming

825
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,480
 what God has already spoken.

826
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,160
 So we can see that same-sex relationships

827
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,520
 were known in Jesus's time.

828
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,920
 It was not uncommon within the Roman Empire culture.

829
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,080
 There was Roman emperors that,

830
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,480
 two of them specifically during Jesus's time

831
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,080
 that had very public wedding ceremonies with men

832
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,840
 and many historical sources that talk about this.

833
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,840
 So all that means Jesus's rejection

834
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,000
 of same-sex relationships was not limited

835
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,760
 to abusive and non-consensual acts

836
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,760
 because all of it existed in his time.

837
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,760
 He would have specified if there was one facet

838
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,360
 of a same-sex relationship that was God-ordained.

839
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,640
 And while Jesus doesn't explicitly name

840
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,020
 same-sex relationships when you look through the text,

841
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,580
 first of all, Paul does.

842
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,440
 It's in there.

843
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,400
 He talks about it in Romans.

844
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,840
 He talks about it in Corinthians.

845
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,520
 And he also talks about it in 1 Timothy.

846
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,640
 And then in Matthew and in Mark,

847
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,520
 Jesus, we see him use the Greek term porneia,

848
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,960
 which generally means sexual misconduct

849
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,800
 that is outlined in Leviticus, talking about moral law.

850
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,040
 So porneia is a catch-all term translated for us

851
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,460
 in our Bibles as sexual immorality.

852
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,480
 And then while Jesus doesn't explicitly

853
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,040
 name same-sex relationships,

854
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,960
 we see that God does in Old Testament law.

855
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,960
 He does that in Leviticus 18.22 and Leviticus 20.13.

856
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,200
 So the text does address same-sex desires.

857
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,600
 And this is where we often hear about the next question,

858
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:21,400
 which is, okay, they talk about it in the Old Testament,

859
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,440
 but didn't Jesus show up and do away

860
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,520
 with Old Testament law?

861
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,520
 So there's some nuance to be understood here.

862
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,920
 'Cause I think when we see arguments in the public space

863
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,360
 about same-sex relationships, we often see people say,

864
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,040
 well, you eat shellfish and you wear clothes

865
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,680
 that have different kinds of material woven into them.

866
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,280
 And so there's an understanding of what the laws are

867
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,560
 and what is continued.

868
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,360
 So Christ fulfilled the sacrificial system

869
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,240
 through his death and resurrection.

870
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,240
 So ceremonial sacrificial laws have been met,

871
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,600
 but that doesn't mean they have been undone.

872
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,000
 They've been fulfilled through Christ's actions,

873
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,820
 which is why we no longer slaughter animals.

874
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,360
 Moral law is a different kind of law.

875
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:29,360
 And moral law is an expression of God's very character.

876
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,880
 That when we look at the moral law,

877
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,200
 it's for those of us who serve him,

878
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,120
 we need to represent his character.

879
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,960
 So we should not be falling into adultery

880
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,400
 or idol worship or murder or theft.

881
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,440
 And God expands on this with the Israelites,

882
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,760
 specifically in Leviticus.

883
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,560
 And so the question is, what did Jesus do

884
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,160
 with the moral law?

885
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,440
 When you read through the gospels,

886
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,880
 you can see in the three years

887
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,280
 of Jesus's earthly ministry,

888
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,280
 he consistently pulls out and represents

889
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,720
 Old Testament moral law,

890
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,760
 often clarifying the misintentions

891
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,240
 by the Jewish majority.

892
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,960
 So he says, hey, you've taken this thing

893
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,960
 and you've twisted it and you've created loopholes

894
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,560
 because you do not understand that this is for your benefit,

895
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,960
 therefore carrying over a decent amount

896
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,760
 of Old Covenant morality and obedience laws

897
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
 to the New Covenant.

898
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,680
 In Matthew 19, Jesus improves upon divorce.

899
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,680
 And in Matthew 5, Jesus is preaching the Sermon on the Mount

900
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,600
 and we get a deeply clarifying picture of this

901
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,920
 because he says, this whole entire time,

902
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,920
 you've thought that it is only about murder,

903
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,440
 but I actually care about the hatred

904
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,680
 welling up in your heart.

905
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,400
 And this whole time, you thought it was only

906
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,680
 about intercourse and I actually care

907
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,440
 about how you look at someone

908
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,520
 and what you think about in your head

909
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,280
 and in your heart towards other people's bodies.

910
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,280
 And you only go so far as to love your neighbor,

911
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,280
 but what it's actually about is the radical love

912
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,040
 that transforms you, that would make you able

913
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,040
 to love your enemy and pray for those who harass

914
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,480
 and mistreat you.

915
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,480
 Jesus takes the moral law and says,

916
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,760
 you've missed the point.

917
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:01,160
 It's not about the checklist, it is about the heart of God

918
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:06,920
 being conveyed to the people around you.

919
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,960
 And I think it's pretty incredible

920
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,200
 that the way Christ fulfills this moral law

921
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,080
 is again by giving us the Holy Spirit

922
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,080
 so that we can actually have the ability to obey,

923
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,680
 not set aside.

924
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,480
 This is foreshadowed in Ezekiel.

925
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,320
 He says, I will give you a new heart

926
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,960
 and put a new spirit in you and I will remove

927
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,760
 from you a heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh

928
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,200
 and I will put my spirit in you and move you

929
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,960
 to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.

930
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,520
 So the moral laws given in the Old Testament

931
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,240
 surrounding sexuality and marriage not only carry over,

932
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,640
 but Christ both raises the bar and enables us

933
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,320
 to be obedient to them by sending the Holy Spirit.

934
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,320
 So after we've walked through all of this,

935
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,600
 the question is, is it possible to be

936
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,600
 in a same-sex relationship and still follow Jesus?

937
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:24,800
 And the answer, and I need you to hear this again,

938
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,640
 that this is a girl who realized she was gay

939
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,520
 when she was 14 years old, who prayed for four years

940
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,720
 to be made straight, who realized

941
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,000
 that probably isn't going to happen.

942
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,560
 The answer I've found myself unearthing

943
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,560
 from the biblical text is no.

944
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:58,880
 I cannot bow to the God of my sexual desires

945
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,840
 while also bowing to Jesus.

946
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,120
 It doesn't work.

947
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,120
 Every time Paul talks about the sin of same-sex relations,

948
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,120
 he clearly communicates that habitual,

949
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,800
 unrepentant pursuit of our desires

950
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,760
 results in separation from God.

951
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,480
 But we also have to acknowledge

952
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:35,800
 we are quick to forget every other person

953
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,920
 listed and named by Paul.

954
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,240
 And the church has unequally called out

955
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,720
 those in same-sex relationships outside of the church

956
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,680
 while it has also placated those who are greedy,

957
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,320
 who cope unhealthily, who habitually gossip,

958
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,560
 who are harsh and not gentle,

959
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,600
 and those who abuse within the church,

960
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,280
 instead of also urging them to repent

961
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,280
 lest they go from the pews or the pulpit straight to hell.

962
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,320
 So while you cannot be in a same-sex relationship

963
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,320
 and actively follow Christ on the narrow road,

964
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,600
 you also cannot be a jerk and follow Christ.

965
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:42,440
 We are all in desperate need

966
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,240
 of the transforming work of the Holy Spirit in our lives

967
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,240
 in order to submit and sacrifice our desires

968
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:58,040
 in exchange for life on the narrow path with Christ.

969
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:04,120
 And I think one of the most compelling things to me

970
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:11,680
 is a relationship with Jesus is the only situation in life

971
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,720
 where the prize at the end also walks with us

972
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,200
 the entire way there.

973
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,640
 - That's really good, Brenna.

974
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,160
 Can we just respond to that real quick?

975
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,320
 [audience applauding]

976
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:39,760
 You know, when we were stepping

977
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,400
 into this conversation tonight,

978
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,440
 I just knew so frequently whenever this conversation

979
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,360
 is discussed from church platforms,

980
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:57,260
 it's often done at one end of the spectrum or the other.

981
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:01,800
 It's done under the banner of truth,

982
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,800
 which ends up leading to an insensitivity,

983
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,480
 religious bigotry, and bullying

984
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,280
 about people that are deeply struggling

985
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,960
 with something that is not just theoretical,

986
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,040
 it's very personal to them.

987
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,000
 But then the other side is a group

988
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,520
 that wildly advocates for grace,

989
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,440
 even to the point that they would redefine

990
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,040
 the Christian sexual ethic.

991
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,720
 The voice you don't often hear speaking into this issue

992
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,480
 is the voice that I hope you've heard tonight.

993
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,200
 It's a much more nuanced voice

994
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,240
 that grabs hold of truth in one hand

995
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,480
 and grabs hold of grace in the other hand

996
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,240
 and brings them to the center in the person of Jesus

997
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,480
 and says, "This is a man full of conviction

998
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,580
 "that there is a way to walk with God,

999
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,580
 "but he is simultaneously full of compassion,

1000
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,780
 "that he, the prize which awaits you

1001
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,680
 "at the end of your life, will walk with you

1002
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,840
 "as you make your way towards him."

1003
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,200
 Brenna, thank you for just helping us

1004
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,280
 navigate the nuance of this.

1005
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,280
 (congregation applauding)

1006
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,280
 So beautiful.

1007
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:20,920
 And not just unpacking it theologically,

1008
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,960
 but really sharing yourself with us.

1009
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,720
 T.A. always says, "God hasn't given us a story to hide,

1010
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,320
 "he's given us a story to tell."

1011
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,760
 And we're really grateful that he has given you your story

1012
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,120
 and that you're willing to tell it to all of us.

1013
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,080
 T.A., would you be willing to just pray for us

1014
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,320
 as we close this time,

1015
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,520
 and then I'll share some announcements

1016
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,440
 and we can dismiss.

1017
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,400
 - I'm gonna pray, but let me just say this,

1018
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,400
 just as a pastor here who believes so strongly

1019
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,200
 in what God is doing right now

1020
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,480
 in the lives of young adults,

1021
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,600
 like this right here, what's happening on Tuesday nights

1022
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,620
 is my favorite thing that is happening on this campus.

1023
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,240
 Like I love this place.

1024
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,940
 Like any chance I get to come here, I wanna be here

1025
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,160
 because I believe that what God is doing here

1026
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,440
 is so important.

1027
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,000
 But we have just had the privilege of sitting here,

1028
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,320
 Brenna, how old are you?

1029
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,160
 - 29.

1030
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,480
 - She's 29, is a young adult.

1031
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:23,160
 And did you see how her life has been shaped by God's work?

1032
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,080
 Like I don't know how many scriptures she just shared,

1033
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,240
 but everything she just shared

1034
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,400
 was so rooted in the word of God.

1035
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,320
 And I just wanna speak that into your lives

1036
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,600
 and say that can be you too.

1037
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,240
 Like if you want, you can know the word of God like that.

1038
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,760
 Like your life can be transformed by the power of the Spirit

1039
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,720
 with the word of God in your hands.

1040
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,560
 - Yeah, that's right.

1041
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,520
 - So I just wanna, I believe in you.

1042
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,720
 I really do.

1043
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,280
 Like this whole idea of the Gen Z,

1044
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,840
 it's biblically illiterate,

1045
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,880
 I'd say, well, I'm looking at a room full of people

1046
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,080
 that have a hunger for God,

1047
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,360
 so let me just say, you know what?

1048
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:12,360
 Like I'll read this comment and then I promise I'll pray.

1049
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,760
 But you know--

1050
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,720
 - That's fine, man.

1051
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,560
 - Just think about--

1052
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,000
 - Do what you wanna do, you know?

1053
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,840
 - God in his kindness has given us his word.

1054
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,800
 But then just to speak to,

1055
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,640
 Brenna mentioned the Holy Spirit so many times.

1056
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:34,440
 And Paul says in Ephesians chapter one,

1057
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,400
 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1058
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,080
 the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom

1059
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,520
 and of revelation and the knowledge of him,

1060
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,080
 having the eyes of your heart enlightened,

1061
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,680
 that you may know what is the hope to which

1062
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,520
 he has called you,

1063
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,840
 what are the riches of his glorious inheritance

1064
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,360
 in the saints, and watch this, don't miss this,

1065
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,360
 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power

1066
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,120
 towards us who believe according to the working

1067
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,680
 of his great might that he worked in Christ

1068
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,400
 when he raised him from the dead

1069
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,560
 and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly place

1070
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,680
 as far above all rule and authority and power

1071
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,120
 and dominion and above.

1072
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,160
 Okay, let me just tell you what that just said, okay?

1073
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,800
 The same power that raised Christ from the dead

1074
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,400
 is available to you.

1075
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,800
 If you go to Romans eight, you know what it tells you?

1076
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,800
 That power is actually the spirit of the living God

1077
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,240
 that Christ asked the Father to give to us.

1078
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,720
 So so often we just live with this mindset of like,

1079
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,040
 I'm a stereotypical single young adult male.

1080
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,240
 It's like no, if you're in Christ,

1081
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,360
 you are a child of the God of the universe

1082
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,360
 who has gifted you the spirit of Christ

1083
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,560
 who just happens to be the power

1084
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,200
 that raised Christ from the dead.

1085
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,000
 So you have the power.

1086
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,500
 (congregation applauding)

1087
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,480
 And then I'll pray.

1088
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,560
 I'm just saying, hey, hey, friends, I'm just telling you,

1089
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:26,280
 fully surrender to the identity that you have in Christ,

1090
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,440
 being a child of God, and just watch what happens.

1091
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,280
 When you trust his word,

1092
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:37,360
 and you surrender fully to God's spirit

1093
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,520
 and his power at work in you, I'm just, I'm saying,

1094
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,680
 that, Brenna's a model of that.

1095
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,080
 And I just say, man, I,

1096
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,720
 just watch what happens, you know?

1097
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,800
 Let me pray.

1098
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,640
 Let me pray.

1099
01:03:53,640 --> 01:04:04,520
 Lord, I pray for every person in this room, God, we're,

1100
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:11,840
 thank you that you're a God who's very personal, God,

1101
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,600
 that you see every person in this room,

1102
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,400
 you know every person's name.

1103
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,960
 Like your affection for every person in this room

1104
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,440
 is very, very deep.

1105
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,280
 God, that in your love for us,

1106
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,840
 you would send your Son, and you, eternal Son of God,

1107
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,520
 in love, would take on flesh,

1108
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,480
 and live perfectly in the midst of temptation,

1109
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,440
 the greatest temptation of which

1110
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,200
 was to come down off the cross.

1111
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,320
 And yet you endured the cross, despising the shame.

1112
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,520
 And you conquered Satan, sin, and death

1113
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,480
 through your resurrection.

1114
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,000
 And I just thank you that your saving grace

1115
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,800
 is available to every person in this room.

1116
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,040
 I think about what John 1, 12 says,

1117
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,200
 for as many as received him, he gave the right

1118
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,040
 to become children of God.

1119
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,000
 I think about what 1 John 3, 1 says,

1120
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,360
 see what kind of love the Father has given to us,

1121
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,920
 that we should be called children of God.

1122
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,520
 So I pray for a generation of young men and women

1123
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,000
 who would truly believe that the truest thing about them

1124
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,800
 is that you, God of the universe,

1125
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,960
 looks at us as a perfect Heavenly Father,

1126
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,280
 and delights to call us your sons and daughters.

1127
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,960
 And you haven't left us to ourselves.

1128
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,600
 You haven't asked us to become something

1129
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,600
 that you are not willing to form us into by your Spirit.

1130
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,520
 And in your kindness, you've given us your words

1131
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,840
 so that we can know your ways and walk in them, Lord.

1132
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:54,400
 So I pray that you'd raise up a generation

1133
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,720
 of men and women who would cling to you, Lord.

1134
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,960
 And we're all on this journey together, Lord.

1135
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,240
 And I pray that we all would just live surrendered,

1136
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,000
 surrendering our sexuality to you.

1137
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,440
 The goal isn't heterosexuality, it's holy sexuality, Lord,

1138
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,680
 that our lives would be defined by you.

1139
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,880
 So we need you, we love you, in Jesus' name, amen.

1140
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,360
 - Amen, Porch, would y'all do a great job

1141
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,360
 of helping me thank T.A. and Brenna, thank you all.

1142
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,860
 (congregation applauding)

1143
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:34,880
 Hey, we can also throw up those resources,

1144
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,240
 if you don't mind.

1145
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,120
 I would love for y'all to see a few books

1146
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,880
 that we would love to commend to you on this topic

1147
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,240
 that Brenna has shared with us specifically

1148
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,080
 that we think could be of great help to you.

1149
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,080
 These are listed right here behind me.

1150
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,560
 If you want more information on this topic,

1151
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,720
 to become more theologically informed

1152
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,880
 on engaging this topic around sexuality,

1153
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,200
 these are wonderful resources.

1154
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,120
 And then I would love to commend to you another book,

1155
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,760
 which is a book our friend Brenna authored herself.

1156
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,280
 It's a book called "Can I Say That?"

1157
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,280
 And it is all about asking difficult questions

1158
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,720
 to and of Jesus.

1159
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,200
 It's available wherever you wanna buy books.

1160
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,400
 You also need to know that Brenna is going to be

1161
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,080
 spending some time with us right after this

1162
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
 in our equipping night, which is outstairs

1163
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,960
 and up in the loft where she's gonna be unpacking,

1164
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,240
 becoming a thinking and asking Christian.

1165
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,760
 We also wanna take a little bit of a moment

1166
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:31,280
 and we wanna share with you that some of you

1167
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,560
 have been coming around for a while,

1168
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,040
 and we previewed this last week,

1169
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,440
 but this Labor Day, we are taking time

1170
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,880
 and going back out to Sky Ranch

1171
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,600
 where we're going to be jumping into launch 2025.

1172
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,880
 I don't know how you feel about that.

1173
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,040
 We're pretty excited for it.

1174
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,720
 We wanted to stand here in front of you and say,

1175
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,840
 if you don't have plans for Labor Day,

1176
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,960
 or even if you do, you have our permission

1177
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,880
 to bring whoever those plans are with

1178
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,840
 out to Sky Ranch and join us for launch

1179
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,920
 because it is going to be an amazing time.

1180
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,120
 You can check out more information

01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,080

1182
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,040

1183
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,420
 because tickets drop on June 3rd.

1184
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,140
 Next week, we will be right back here

 continuing in our series, Revive,

1186
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,320
 but until then, go in peace, to love and serve the Lord,

1187
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,240
 and join us at Equipping Night.
