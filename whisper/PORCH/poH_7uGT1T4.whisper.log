[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.600]   - What's up, Porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.740]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.200]   Hey, it's good to see you, I hope that all is well.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.400]   Happy Tuesday to you.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.880]   My name is Timothy Atik, I'm one of the teaching pastors
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.920]   here at Watermark on Tuesday nights as well as on Sundays.
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.900]   If this is your first time ever with us on a Tuesday night,
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.480]   thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560]   I do wanna give a shout out to all the Porch Live
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.760]   locations watching, especially wanna say hello
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   to Porch Live Midland, Porch Live Tulsa,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.320]   Porch Live Boise, so glad that you're tuning in tonight,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.720]   I hope all is well.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.320]   So here's the deal, I've got three boys
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.280]   and all three of my boys have birthdays at some point
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.280]   in the month that we are in, which is not great financially
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.640]   but it's just a reality for the Atik family,
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.160]   which means that we are thinking a lot about gifts
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.000]   that we are giving and the third kid's birthday
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.280]   is on October 12th and then right after that,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.240]   like our kids are gonna be thinking about what they want
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.560]   for Christmas, so for the whole fall,
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.160]   we are really thinking about presents
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.240]   and something that I've learned over the years is this,
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240]   when you give a gift to someone,
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.240]   you care about their response, the response matters.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.920]   Like I remember when my oldest son Noah
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.800]   was three years old at Christmas,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.080]   he got a lot of gifts 'cause he was the first grandkid
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   and I remember him on Christmas, this was his rhythm,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.000]   he would take a present, he would unwrap it,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.360]   he would look at it, he would not say thank you
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.720]   and he would put it to the side,
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.360]   he would grab the next gift, he would unwrap it,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.600]   he would look at it, he would not say thank you
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.200]   and he would put it to the side.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   After he unwrapped all of his gifts,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.320]   he looked at my wife and me and said,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.800]   what else you got for me?
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.000]   I was like, we're gonna need to work on that,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.880]   you're a pastor's kid, that's not gonna fly,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.760]   Jesus is the reason for the season, anyway.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.960]   It's not the response we were looking for.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.920]   Your response matters when you're receiving a gift.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.120]   I remember when my wife and I, in our first year
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.840]   of marriage, I remember the first time
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.400]   we were exchanging gifts as a married couple,
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   this is a big moment and I did not win in this situation.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   She gave me for Christmas, she gave me three shirts
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.280]   that I would consider to be super basic.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.400]   Now, here's what you need to know about me, guys,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.280]   I'm an Enneagram four, which means that
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.760]   I think I'm really special and I need to be special
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.800]   and I need everything to be unique,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.700]   so I need the clothes that I wear to be unique
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.800]   and I know what you're thinking,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   you're wearing a polo in jeans,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.200]   I don't wanna talk about it.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.600]   But on this particular Christmas,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   I opened these three shirts and I just,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.280]   it's not that I responded poorly, I just didn't respond,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   I was like, oh, okay, well, there's that.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.200]   You know, like, I don't remember what I said,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.000]   I don't remember if that was the moment
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.680]   that Cat threw a blanket at me
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.340]   or if that was another fight,
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.600]   I just remember it didn't go well.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.200]   But then I think about a time when I was in sixth grade
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.600]   and I received a gift and we still have the video of it
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   to this day, when I opened that gift, this was my response.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   I kid you not, this is what I did, I go.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.940]   Because at that time in my life,
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.240]   there was a band out called New Kids on the Block
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.920]   and I was kind of into it
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.440]   and so they kind of fueled my response.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.720]   That was the right response to the gift that I had received.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.800]   Your response when you're receiving a gift,
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.280]   it really matters.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.300]   And the reason I tell you that is because tonight,
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.000]   we are starting a new series
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.180]   that we're gonna be in for a lot of this fall
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.820]   where we are journeying through the gospel of John.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.980]   And the gospel of John was written to help you and me
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.980]   have the right response to God's gift of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.820]   The gospel of John has the most famous verse
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.900]   in the entire Bible.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.420]   Even if you're not familiar with the Bible,
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.700]   you're most likely familiar with this verse.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.020]   John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that he," what?
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.460]   "That he gave his only son,
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.400]   "that whoever believes in him should not perish,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.900]   "but have eternal life."
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.460]   Jesus was a gift from God to you and to me.
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.180]   How you respond to the gift that God has given you matters.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.060]   John, in his gospel, he uses the word believe
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.140]   about 84 times.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.620]   That's the whole goal of the book.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.360]   The goal of the book is that you and I would believe.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.900]   Now, if you're sitting there saying,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.360]   "I've believed in Jesus for a long time, so next,"
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.100]   like, I get it.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.940]   Well, what you need to know is if you aren't a Christian,
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.940]   the goal is that you would move towards basic belief.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.300]   And if you've been a Christian for a long time,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.280]   my hope is that this book is gonna move you
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.820]   toward bold belief in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.420]   This book is my favorite gospel out of the four
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.500]   that are in our Bible.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.140]   I love this book.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.220]   It's a powerful book that is going to drive us
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.220]   towards the right response to the gift of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.940]   Just so you know what we're calling the series,
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.840]   we are calling it Glory.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.660]   And that is very clear behind me.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.140]   So it's called Glory, and you're gonna find out
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.840]   in a little bit what we mean when we say Glory.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.240]   But the goal of this series is that you would behold
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.900]   Jesus Christ in this book,
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.620]   and it would lead to the right response.
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.340]   Just so you know how important this book,
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.260]   the Gospel of John is,
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.900]   one commentator referred to it
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.420]   as God's love letter to the world.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.340]   Martin Luther, the German monk
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.980]   who sparked the Protestant Reformation said this.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.220]   He said, "Should a tyrant succeed
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.400]   "in destroying the Holy Scriptures
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.680]   "in only a single copy of the Epistle to the Romans
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.360]   "and the Gospel according to John escape him,
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.220]   "Christianity would be saved."
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.940]   Why does he say that?
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.940]   He says that because this book is so instrumental.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.020]   It is so essential to us understanding the beauty
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.140]   in the person of Jesus Christ,
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.100]   and it drives us toward the right response to him.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.900]   We are learning from John.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.380]   If you're new to the Bible,
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.220]   and John really isn't on your radar,
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.440]   John was a fisherman before he laid down his life
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.500]   as a fisherman to follow Jesus Christ full-time.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.380]   Jesus had three guys that were kind of in his inner circle.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.200]   It was Peter, and then John and his brother James.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.300]   John was so tight with Jesus
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.380]   that Jesus gave him and his brother a nickname.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.160]   He referred to James and John as the Sons of Thunder,
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.880]   which is a pretty baller nickname.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.200]   Like, no one has ever referred to me as a Son of Thunder.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.720]   Like, I just don't put off that type of vibe,
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.400]   but like, that was a killer nickname for James and John.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.440]   John is the guy on the night that Jesus has his last supper.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.600]   Do you know what John's doing?
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.400]   He's reclining on Jesus's chest
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.380]   because they're that tight.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.440]   John refers to himself as the one that Jesus loved.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.840]   John was the guy that when Jesus
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.440]   was being led to his crucifixion,
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.840]   he entrusted his mother to John.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.120]   John was the first disciple to reach the empty tomb.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.400]   He was the first disciple to believe
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.640]   in the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.840]   John went on to write five books in the New Testament,
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.640]   and John played a key role
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.080]   in the establishment of the church.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.680]   That's who we're learning from.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.960]   This is a guy who had a very,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.400]   very tight relationship with Jesus.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.480]   He's a guy who had the right response to Jesus,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.720]   and he writes 21 chapters in this book
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.440]   so that you and I would have the right response to Jesus.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.400]   So tonight, here's what I wanna do.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.640]   I wanna speak to three different groups
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.080]   of people in this room.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.000]   I first am going to speak to those in the room
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.920]   who aren't Christians.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.000]   You don't have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.800]   The only reason you're here tonight
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.480]   is because a friend invited you,
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.440]   and you've told them no so many times,
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.640]   you finally felt like they needed a win.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.880]   And so for you, the response that I wanna encourage
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.680]   in you tonight is to investigate Jesus.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.840]   I also wanna speak to a group of people in this room
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.080]   who are not Christians yet,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.320]   but you're gonna become a Christian tonight
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.400]   because God is doing something miraculous in your life
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.200]   and something deeply important in your life.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.480]   And something deep inside of you is like,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.360]   I need to be here tonight.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.680]   And the response that I wanna encourage you toward tonight
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.000]   is to receive Jesus.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   And then I wanna speak to a group of people
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.520]   who've been following Jesus for a long time.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.160]   Jesus is your savior.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.800]   Jesus is your king.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.840]   And the response that I wanna encourage in you
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.440]   is that you would behold Jesus tonight.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.640]   Three responses.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.800]   Those are the right responses to the gift of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.160]   First, I wanna speak to the group of people in this room
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.600]   who would say, I am not a Christian.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.840]   Maybe you're an atheist.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.080]   Maybe you're an agnostic.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.440]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.080]   This is a place where you can come
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.480]   and evaluate what we believe is the word of God.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.760]   Please come back.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000]   But if that's you,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.960]   I wanna invite you to investigate Jesus.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.600]   There's a famous pastor named A.W. Tozer,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.920]   and he said, what comes into our minds
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.120]   when we think about God
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.400]   is the most important thing about us.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.800]   And I would just encourage you to evaluate that.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.120]   What comes to mind when you think about Jesus Christ,
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.520]   that is potentially the most important thing about you.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   Yesterday on Instagram, we asked what you thought of Jesus.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.000]   And some of you said, he's my best friend.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.800]   Someone said, he's like an older sibling to me.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.720]   One of you was super honest and just said, I love him,
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.040]   but I get frustrated with him
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.480]   and don't understand his plans most of the time.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.400]   That's real.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.000]   So I don't know what you think of Jesus
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.640]   when you think about him.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.840]   But I would imagine that many of you here
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.000]   who are not Christians, if I were to ask you,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.560]   what comes to mind when I mentioned the name Jesus,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.120]   you might say, not much.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   Or when you think about Jesus,
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.080]   you think about the people that you know
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.000]   that claim to be following him.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.320]   And the people you struggle with most in this world
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.840]   are the people who seem hypocritical,
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.640]   but they claim to know Jesus.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   Or maybe when you think of Jesus,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.740]   you think about the miracles you've heard
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.000]   that the Bible claims that he did.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.760]   Or you know about the fact that Jesus is said
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.560]   to have been crucified on a cross.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.860]   And there are billions of people around the world
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.880]   that would subscribe to his religion.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.020]   The chances are, when you think about Jesus,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.860]   what comes to mind, it's the 33 years
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.300]   that he lived on earth.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.820]   But if that's all that comes to your mind,
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.380]   what you need to know is that you are cropping out
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:42.380]   eternity from Jesus's identity and his activity.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.940]   So I want to invite you to investigate Jesus.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.740]   Like, let me ask you, have you ever thought of Jesus as God?
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.100]   Have you ever thought of Jesus as God?
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.540]   Look with me at the Gospel of John chapter one.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.100]   The Gospel of John chapter one.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.700]   Here's how it starts in verse one.
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.620]   It says, "In the beginning was the word,
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.620]   "and the word was with God, and the word was God."
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.700]   John here is referring to Jesus as the word.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.780]   Why would John refer to Jesus as the word?
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.820]   Well, think about what a word is.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.380]   A word is a thought expressed.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.520]   A word makes known something hidden.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.860]   It makes something unheard heard.
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.780]   It makes something invisible visible.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.080]   Here's what that means.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.380]   Why is John referring to Jesus as the word?
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.520]   Because what he's trying to communicate
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.540]   is that Jesus is God's greatest communication
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.780]   to humanity about himself.
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.420]   So if you want to know God,
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.340]   then the best thing you can do is know Jesus Christ.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.940]   If you want to know more of God, then investigate Jesus.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.360]   If you have some working knowledge of the Bible,
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.280]   if you've even just read the first verse
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.220]   of the entire thing, it's Genesis 1.1,
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.320]   think about how it starts.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.100]   It says, "In the beginning,
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.820]   "God created the heavens and the earth."
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.220]   Did you hear how John chapter one, verse one started?
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.580]   "In the beginning was the word,
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.220]   "and the word was with God, and the word was God."
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.780]   According to John, Jesus's story doesn't start
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.980]   in a manger in Bethlehem.
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.220]   John is placing the eternal word,
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.480]   the eternal son of God, who would take on flesh
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.340]   in the person of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.340]   he is placing him before the creation of the world.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.540]   The eternal word that we now know as Jesus
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.060]   is in fact God.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.380]   He's not just a wise teacher.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.360]   He's not just a prophet.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.260]   He's not just a significant religious figure.
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.180]   He is God.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.940]   And to believe that he's just a good man
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.940]   or a wise teacher is crazy because Jesus claimed to be God
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.860]   and all of his followers claimed that he was God.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.620]   So if someone is claiming to be God,
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.620]   but he's just a man and not God,
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.620]   that either makes him a liar or a crazy person.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:39.000]   And so the reality is Jesus is God.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.520]   The God of Christianity is the God where Jesus is God.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.620]   If Jesus isn't God, then it isn't Christianity.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.240]   Have you ever thought of Jesus being God?
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.080]   What about this?
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.600]   Have you ever thought of Jesus as the creator of all things?
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.440]   Look at what John says in verses two and three.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.000]   He says, "He," referring to the word,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.960]   who we now know as Jesus,
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.640]   "He was in the beginning with God.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.980]   "All things," watch that,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.700]   "All things were made through him.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.840]   "And without him was not anything made that was made."
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.520]   So according to John, the word Jesus
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.000]   that we now know as Jesus,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.480]   he was the agent of all creation.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.840]   So when you think about Jesus,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.500]   do you think to give him credit for his work
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.120]   in everything that has been made, including you?
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   Or what about this?
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.280]   Have you ever thought of Jesus
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.520]   as the one sustaining your life?
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.960]   Listen to what verse four says.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.320]   John says, "In him was life.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   "In the life was the light of men."
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.520]   So I want you to think about this.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.280]   John refers to Jesus as the light of men.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   I think we can all agree that life on the earth
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.160]   is impossible without the sun, which provides us light.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.760]   Physical life needs the light that the sun gives
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.960]   in order for us to live.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.600]   And yet what John is proposing is that even more important
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   than the physical sun is the eternal son of God, Jesus Christ.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.560]   In him is life, meaning that apart from Jesus,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.020]   it's actually impossible for you to live physically,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:34.020]   but it's also impossible for you to live spiritually.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.420]   Some of you might be sitting there wondering,
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.740]   what has God ever done for me?
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.740]   I just want to invite every person in here
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.460]   to just take a breath, just breathe in, breathe out.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.480]   There's your answer.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.700]   Like that breath you just took is the best rebuttal
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.060]   to the belief that Jesus is irrelevant to your life.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.660]   Because according to John,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.700]   Jesus is not only the creator of life,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.660]   he's the sustainer of life.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.700]   You have oxygen in your lungs today
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.580]   because the eternal son of God is the agent
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.220]   through which that breath has come.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.940]   And then verse five, what does John say?
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.100]   He says, "The light shines in the darkness
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.020]   "and the darkness has not overcome it."
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.580]   There's this shift in this passage
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.900]   in the first five verses.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.780]   Verse five marks a shift, and it's subtle,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.720]   but John is shifting from talking about the physical
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.580]   to now talking about the spiritual.
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.180]   See, darkness wasn't just a reference
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.460]   to the absence of light in life
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.260]   at the beginning of creation.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.860]   It was actually to symbolize evil within humanity
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.980]   in the absence of spiritual life.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.020]   So what John is saying when he says,
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.700]   "The light shines in the darkness
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.620]   "and the darkness has not overcome it,"
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.460]   is he is saying that not only is Jesus
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.560]   the sustainer of physical life,
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   but he is our only hope for spiritual life,
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.060]   life with God.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.620]   So the reason that I tell you this,
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.420]   if you are not a Christian in the room,
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.940]   and when you think about Jesus,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.740]   all you think about is either the people
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.020]   who claim to follow him or the few details
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.600]   that you know about his life on the earth,
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.940]   what you need to understand
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.300]   is that you are cropping out eternity
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.920]   from Jesus's identity and his activity.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.300]   Why do we use the crop feature on our photos?
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.540]   It is to remove things that are either unattractive
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.160]   or unimportant.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.800]   Here's what you need to understand.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   If Jesus feels unimpressive or irrelevant to you,
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.920]   do you know what's happened?
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.800]   You've cropped out what you think is unimportant.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.880]   And what you've done is you've cropped out
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.220]   so much of Jesus's identity and activity
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:12.220]   that you are no longer actually dealing with the real Jesus.
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.720]   You're actually just dealing with a Jesus
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.400]   that you have fabricated in your mind.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.820]   Our world says that you get to decide who God is,
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.940]   but we don't get to decide who God is.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.940]   We only get to decide what we do with who God is.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.680]   And so if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.440]   my invitation to you,
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.040]   the right way to respond to the gift of Jesus
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.720]   is to investigate Jesus.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.180]   Let me explain it this way.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:51.400]   My wife and my three boys and I,
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   we have a standing tradition that Friday night each week
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   is pizza and a movie night.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.760]   So we get a cheap pizza from Costco,
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.840]   which is surprisingly good for the price.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.520]   You young adults should know about Costco pizza.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.720]   If you don't, go get a membership.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.660]   It's worth it.
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.420]   [audience applauding]
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   But we get a cheap pizza from Costco
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.420]   and every Friday night we watch a movie.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.460]   Well, we have done that so many Friday nights
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.220]   that it's getting harder and harder
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.000]   to decide what movie to watch,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.460]   because it feels like we've gone through
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.420]   so many of the good ones.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.420]   But there's this weird thing happening with my boys,
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.020]   and I don't know if it's just that they're getting older
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.500]   and they're beginning to reach that point
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.780]   where nothing that their dad says is cool,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.060]   and if dad suggests it, we should definitely not do it.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.340]   I don't know if that's what's happening.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.340]   But there's this weird phenomenon happening
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.580]   where I can name a movie.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.180]   I can say, "Hey, we should watch this movie."
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.200]   And it can be one of the classics,
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.420]   one of the greats from the '80s or the '90s
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.020]   that is on like lists of top movies for families.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.060]   And my boys could have never heard of it,
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.860]   never seen a trailer for it, and be like, "Nope."
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.060]   So just think about it.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.900]   Here's what they have said, "Nope," to "Princess Bride."
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.420]   Remember the Titans.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.260]   Hook.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.820]   Angels in the Outfield, y'all know that?
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.800]   Maybe not really.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.320]   Stuff like that.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.460]   I'm sure that there's more.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.700]   There's one of my favorites, it was called "Short Circuit,"
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.900]   which was about a robot,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.760]   and they're probably justified in saying no to it.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.220]   But it's this weird thing
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.180]   where it's easy for them to reject something
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:47.060]   that they have no knowledge or any familiarity with.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.380]   And I tell you that just to say,
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.820]   "Don't be like my kids when it comes to Jesus."
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.140]   It's often easy to reject something
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.820]   that you have no familiarity with.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:03.280]   My encouragement to you is if Jesus is
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.420]   who this book says He is,
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.780]   now you might internally be like,
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.260]   "No, I don't believe that book."
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.340]   Well, but just because you don't believe it
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.640]   doesn't mean that it's not true.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.580]   Your opinions have no bearing on truth,
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.420]   but truth should have a lot of bearing on your opinions.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.540]   And so my encouragement is to at least investigate
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:30.140]   so that you can come to a place where you can say,
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.120]   with full confidence and full integrity,
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.280]   "I have investigated the person of Jesus Christ,
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.680]   the one that people claimed was God,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.640]   the one that people claimed was the creator
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.160]   and sustainer of all things,
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.760]   the one that people claimed was the only way
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.200]   to have a true life with God, and I reject it."
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.480]   You wanna be able to say that with full integrity,
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.560]   that you've done the hard work to investigate,
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.180]   but don't reject a person
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.680]   that you have zero familiarity with.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.300]   Investigate 'em.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.380]   And we would love to help you do that.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.940]   The second group of people that I wanna talk to
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.140]   is I wanna talk to a group of people in the room
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.100]   that a miracle is happening in your life.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.460]   There's no other way to say it
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.180]   besides there's a miracle happening in your life.
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.660]   Like you're here tonight
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.940]   because something deep inside of you was like,
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.980]   "I need to be there."
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.200]   Like something's going on with you
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.700]   where you've been contemplating your life more and more,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.180]   thoughts of God are popping into your head more and more,
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.420]   you've been thinking about eternity more,
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.600]   you've wondered more and more
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.440]   what the purpose is in your life.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.100]   The things that you've been looking to
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.860]   in this world to satisfy you
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.100]   just don't seem to be doing what you hoped they would do.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.100]   And so in your quest to feel satisfied,
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.580]   you feel lacking and empty.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:01.340]   And what has happened is God is drawing you to himself
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.240]   and tonight he is introducing himself to you.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.580]   And he's inviting you into a relationship with him.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.720]   If that's you, a miracle is happening in your life.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.180]   And the right response to the gift of Jesus
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.340]   is to receive Jesus.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.500]   Look at what John says in verses nine through 13.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.220]   He says, "The true light, Jesus,
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.500]   "which gives light to everyone,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.000]   "was coming into the world.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.200]   "He was in the world and the world was made through him,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.940]   "yet the world didn't know him.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.640]   "He came to his own and his own people did not receive him.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.460]   "But to all who did receive him,
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.700]   "who believed in his name,
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.300]   "he gave the right to become children of God,
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.700]   "who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.460]   "nor of the will of man, but of God."
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.860]   What I want you to see is the terminology in these verses.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.820]   It turns relational.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.820]   Do you see what it says?
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.700]   It says that Jesus came into the world,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.180]   he made the world, and yet the world didn't know him,
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.540]   which means he moved in.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.300]   God in the person of Jesus moved in close enough
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.780]   for people to be able to know him.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.140]   Watch what verse 11 says.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.660]   It says he came to his own.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.260]   There's relationship.
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.620]   He came to his own people
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.380]   and his own people didn't receive him.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:30.700]   Like he moved in close enough
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.780]   that people had to make a decision
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:37.240]   either to receive him or reject him.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.020]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:45.020]   Jesus, the world was made through the eternal son of God,
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.660]   who we know to be Jesus.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.100]   And yet what do we do?
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.700]   We give credit to other gods
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.620]   because we subscribe to other religions
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.580]   or we give credit to random natural forces.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.020]   That would drive you crazy.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.300]   Like have you ever been at work
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.860]   and you work really hard on a project at work
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.420]   and yet your boss gives credit to a group of people
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.700]   when you're the one who's done all the work
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.620]   and something in you is like,
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.180]   "No, no, no, I'm the one who did it."
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.900]   Like flashback to high school
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.180]   when you were in group projects.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.860]   Some of y'all loved group projects
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.900]   because you let other people do all the work.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.780]   And then there were those of you who hated group projects
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.640]   because you did all the work.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.300]   How maddening is it and frustrating
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:42.580]   when other people are given credit for something you did?
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.060]   Jesus came into the world,
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.780]   the world which he had made
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.300]   and yet people didn't know him or receive him.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.460]   What grace and love.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:00.460]   This is how good God is that you can live your entire life
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.900]   on the earth that he made and not receive him.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.540]   That is grace.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.380]   That's grace.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.140]   And if you do receive him,
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.500]   do you know what the result is?
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.980]   If you do receive him,
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.980]   the result is that you have a place
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.960]   in the family of God for all of eternity.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.580]   That's why Jesus says,
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.060]   "But to all who did receive him,
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.220]   "he gave the right to become children of God."
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.860]   Which is amazing to think about this.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.060]   There's 8 billion people on the planet
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.060]   and the God of the universe doesn't just know your name.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:45.140]   He actually calls you his son or his daughter.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:51.540]   And so what is the right response to the gift of Jesus?
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.420]   According to John 1, verse 12, it's to receive him.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.560]   That word in the Greek,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.540]   the original language of the New Testament,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.540]   it carries the idea of welcoming intimate connection.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.180]   It's like when a man or woman receives someone in marriage
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.700]   or when a host receives a house guest.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.140]   On October, or I'm sorry, on June 2nd, 2006,
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.980]   I proposed to Kat.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.060]   And I'll save you the story,
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:26.060]   but it culminated in me getting down on a knee in a rowboat
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.220]   and asking Kat to marry me.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:33.220]   And she said yes, which I praise God for to this day.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.600]   But here's the reality.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.480]   When Kat said yes, she wasn't just saying yes
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.100]   to me putting a ring on her finger.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.960]   She wasn't just saying yes to the most expensive party
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.140]   that we would ever throw in our lives.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.860]   What she was saying yes to was life with this guy.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.560]   She was saying yes to living together
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.920]   for the rest of her days on earth.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.980]   She was saying yes to eating the majority
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.460]   of her meals with me.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.460]   She was saying yes to raising three crazy boys with me.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.500]   She was saying yes to the good times in life
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.900]   and the low times in life with me.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.860]   She was saying yes to a lifetime of connection.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:21.100]   To receive Jesus is to welcome
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.060]   intimate connection with him.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.840]   So we need to be careful that we don't overcomplicate
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.680]   receiving Jesus.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.400]   And at the same time, we have to be careful
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.660]   not to water it down.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.360]   When we talk about receiving Jesus
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.240]   or welcoming intimate connection,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.520]   I'm not talking about you signing up
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   for a lifetime supply of requirements
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:45.080]   that you have to check off every day of your life.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.920]   But it's also not just receiving information or ideas.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.380]   It's receiving Jesus.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.040]   It's welcoming intimate connection with him.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.480]   Remember, your response matters.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.680]   And the nature of the gift should drive
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.840]   the nature of your response.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.760]   What do I mean by that?
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.240]   Here's what I mean.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.940]   Often people treat Jesus like a ticket.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.760]   That the reason to believe in Jesus
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.680]   is so that you get entrance into heaven.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.400]   But think about a ticket.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.600]   A ticket is only useful for one second
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.000]   when it's being scanned for entrance.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.860]   It's useless before and it's useless after.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.040]   Jesus is not a ticket.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.840]   He's not only useful for just entrance into heaven.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.800]   Jesus isn't a ticket.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.840]   He's God, he's savior, he's rescuer, he's king, he's friend.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.540]   To receive Jesus is to welcome a lifetime
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.040]   of intimate connection with him.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.800]   And it begins with a prayer to God
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.200]   in which you acknowledge your sin
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.560]   and your need and desire for a savior and king.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.800]   So if you're here tonight and you're like,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.580]   I think he's talking about me.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.800]   I think that a miracle is happening in my life.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.840]   And I think Jesus is calling me to himself.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.980]   Then say yes.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   Like what is keeping you from receiving Jesus tonight?
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.880]   Receive him.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.120]   And then the third group of people I wanna speak to
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.240]   is the people in the room who have considered themselves
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.520]   followers of Jesus Christ for a long time.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.800]   The right response to the gift of Jesus is to behold Jesus.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.520]   When I talk about beholding Jesus,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.220]   I'm talking about seeing Jesus.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.560]   I'm talking about the idea of spiritual sight
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.020]   that we find in the scriptures.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.040]   Like the apostle Paul in Ephesians 1:18 says,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.320]   "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.040]   "in order that you may know the hope
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.440]   "to which he has called you."
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.040]   Jesus, after he feeds 5,000 people
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.800]   with a little kid's lunchbox,
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.360]   he then feeds 4,000 people.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.700]   We don't think about the feeding of the 4,000
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.920]   like we think about the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.520]   But after he feeds the 5,000 and then he feeds the 4,000,
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.320]   he gets on a boat with his closest friends, the disciples,
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.280]   who actually had helped distribute the miraculous food
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.560]   that Jesus had just made.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.760]   And when they get into the boat,
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.560]   they start arguing with each other.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.000]   Do you wanna know why they're arguing?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.200]   Because they forgot to bring bread.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.840]   And it's like, guys,
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:38.880]   like if there's one thing you don't need to be worried about
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.520]   when you're with Jesus,
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.000]   it's bread.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.640]   Like he just fed 9,000 plus people bread.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.760]   Some of y'all are gluten intolerant,
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.520]   you're like, I don't get this at all.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.920]   I don't know what we're talking about right now.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.320]   Listen to what Jesus says to them, Mark 8.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.440]   Jesus, aware of this, said to them,
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.320]   why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread?
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.280]   I love this.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.460]   He says, do you not yet perceive or understand?
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.340]   He's like, what are we doing here, people?
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:20.700]   You were there for the 5,000, you were there for the 4,000.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.000]   Do you not get it?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.120]   You don't perceive?
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.000]   Now watch what he says, this is so important.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.680]   He says, are your hearts hardened?
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.340]   Having eyes, do you not see?
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.560]   When I talk about beholding Jesus,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.660]   I'm talking about spiritual sight.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:44.240]   It's the reality that it's possible to see Jesus
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.540]   without seeing Jesus.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.760]   It's possible to come to the porch
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:53.760]   and to go to all the effort, to park in a parking garage
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.400]   and literally get all of your steps for the day.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.840]   Like if you show up with zero steps,
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:04.560]   you're going to leave with your exercise ring closed,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.280]   just coming to the porch.
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.320]   And you can go to all that effort
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.820]   and leave here without seeing Jesus.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.200]   When the night is all about Jesus,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.540]   why does the porch exist?
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.200]   The porch exists to call any and every young adult to what?
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.320]   See Jesus and surrender fully to life with him.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:30.120]   You know what spiritual blindness is?
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.700]   Spiritual blindness is simply seeing Jesus
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.520]   without being captivated by his goodness
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.400]   or being compelled to worship him.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:43.240]   It's going to all the effort to be here tonight
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.540]   and leaving here unmoved.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.400]   So what I want to do is I want to show you
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.360]   where I'm getting this from John chapter one.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.560]   I'm going to read you right now the most important verse
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.280]   in the entire book of John.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.680]   There's 21 chapters.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.940]   This is the most important verse.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.440]   Actually, the next 20 chapters of the book
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.020]   seek to unpack this one verse.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.180]   Here's what it says.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.120]   It says in verse 14, it says,
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.960]   "The word became flesh and dwelt among us
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.200]   and we have," say it, what's that word?
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.160]   We have seen or beheld his glory.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.280]   Glory is of the only son from the father,
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.400]   full of grace and truth.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.960]   I just want to break this verse down
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.840]   because I want you to see Jesus.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.640]   And remember, I'm talking to the Christians.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.660]   And what I'm doing is I am inviting those of you
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.600]   who have known Jesus for a long time.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.480]   I want you to hear what I'm saying
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.240]   like you have never heard it before in your life.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.200]   Listen to what it says.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.640]   The word became flesh.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.480]   Do you know what that's saying?
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.640]   It's saying God became man.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   Rip off the calluses of your heart
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.880]   to the reality of the incarnation
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.720]   that God stepped out of heaven and put on skin.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.240]   Blood flowed through his veins.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.940]   God became a man.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.320]   That is crazy.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.920]   It's crazy.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:02.760]   Why?
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.680]   Because man spends his life
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.800]   trying to ascend to the place of God.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.160]   That's why Jay-Z nicknamed himself Hova,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.880]   which is short for Jehovah, name for God.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.920]   That's why Kanye West has a song called "I Am a God."
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.800]   Why?
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.720]   Because man wants to ascend to the place of God.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.840]   What we're talking about is God
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.800]   descending to the place of man.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.320]   Now watch John's wording.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.640]   He says, "And the word became flesh and dwelt among us,
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.000]   "and we have seen his glory."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.800]   We have seen, we have beheld his glory.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.200]   What does John mean when he says we've seen his glory?
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.960]   What does glory mean?
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.240]   Well, commentators believe that when John
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.160]   is writing these words, most likely,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.640]   he has Exodus chapter 33 in his mind.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.520]   And what's great is Exodus 33
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.140]   helps us understand what glory means.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.120]   Moses says this in Exodus 33.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.520]   Moses says to God, "Please show me your glory."
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.720]   It's a great prayer to pray.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.280]   Please show me your glory.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.200]   And what does God say?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   He says, "I will make all my goodness pass before you,
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:29.840]   "and will proclaim before you my name, the Lord."
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.640]   Do you know what the glory of God is?
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:36.160]   The glory of God is the supreme goodness of God.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.020]   It is everything praiseworthy of God
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.760]   wrapped up and bundled and manifested to humanity
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:48.480]   so that humanity can taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.600]   Let me ask you, if you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.280]   when's the last time you were captivated
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.960]   by the beauty and the goodness of God?
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   When's the last time you tasted and saw that God is good?
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:09.600]   What does it mean when John says we have beheld his glory?
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.440]   Well, what you need to understand is God's supreme goodness
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.200]   has been revealed to us in the person of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.440]   specifically through the grace and the truth
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.840]   that Christ brought into the world.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.660]   That's why John says, "We have seen his glory,
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.400]   "glory of the only Son from the Father,
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.240]   "full of grace and truth."
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.200]   I'm inviting you to behold, once again,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   the grace of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.400]   Behold his grace because through receiving Jesus,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   we have complete forgiveness from our worst moments.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.000]   We have healing and relief from our greatest shame.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.840]   We're loved despite our most unlovable flaws.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.360]   We are pursued with a perfect love,
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.800]   even when we wander in our imperfection.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.900]   We can live near to God now and for all of eternity
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.360]   as loved, accepted, delighted and children of God.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.940]   We did nothing, he did everything.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.800]   We deserve nothing, and yet we get everything
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.440]   because of him.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   He's full of grace, but he's also full of truth.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.280]   What does it mean that Jesus is full of truth?
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.200]   It means that Jesus has come and he has shown us
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.320]   the one and only way to have a real relationship
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.640]   with the God of the universe.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.040]   Jesus says in John 14, six, "I am the way, the truth,
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.880]   "and the life.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   "No one comes to the Father except through me."
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.080]   You don't find your own way to God.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.800]   Jesus says, "I'm the true way, I'm the truth."
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:39.000]   And all of this grace and truth has manifested itself
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.040]   in Jesus, who went to the cross, bore our shame,
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.400]   and rose from the dead.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.060]   That's why Revelation 19, 13 says about Jesus,
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.040]   "He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood,
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.200]   "and the name by which he is called is," what?
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.480]   "The word of God."
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.940]   The word of God, God's greatest communication to us
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:04.520]   about himself was God who took on flesh,
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.840]   and the reason that his robe is dipped in blood
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.040]   at the end of the Bible is because Jesus went to the cross
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:13.320]   and endured the wrath that was for our sin.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.480]   He was punished so that you and I wouldn't have to be.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.600]   He was buried and he rose from the dead as a demonstration
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.320]   that the God of the universe, a holy and perfect God,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.760]   had accepted his payment on behalf
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.040]   of very unholy, imperfect people.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.120]   So I just wanna ask you, Christian,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.160]   when was the last time that you beheld Jesus?
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.360]   When was the last time you were captivated by his goodness
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.380]   and compelled to worship him with your life?
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.280]   If you're here tonight as a Christian
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.920]   and your heart feels cold to Jesus right now,
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.000]   I wanna help you.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.860]   If there's a lack of worship, it's due to a lack of sight.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:59.580]   And so let me just ask you, is there sin?
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.840]   Is there sin in your life?
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.240]   Listen to what Matthew 5, 8 says.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:07.880]   "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   Sin hinders sight.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.120]   Do you understand that?
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.500]   Sin hinders sight.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.780]   It's hard to be captivated by the goodness of God
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.760]   when you are captivated by the pleasure of sin.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.000]   If you wanna see Jesus, I wanna say this with love,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.720]   but repent of your sin.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:31.680]   Don't walk out of here and live with one foot in
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.080]   and one foot out.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.720]   Don't cling to sin thinking that it's not a big deal
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.760]   and it's really not hindering sight.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   When you release that sin, you're gonna see
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.840]   just how blurry your vision has become.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.560]   And when you see Jesus clearly,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.480]   you know what you're gonna see,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.760]   you're gonna see something that is far more satisfying
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.360]   than your sin ever could have been.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.260]   Repent.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.800]   Another question to answer is, are you settling?
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.760]   Are you settling?
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.160]   What do I mean by that?
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.840]   Here's what I mean.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.320]   Is it possible that you are living vicariously
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.080]   through someone else's sight?
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.360]   You know what drives me crazy about my kids' generation?
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.080]   Is that my boys, one of my boys will watch
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.140]   20 minute long YouTube videos
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.040]   of other people playing Minecraft.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.440]   And I'm like, bro, you have Minecraft yourself.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.960]   Why would you watch someone else play a game that you have?
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.800]   Makes no sense.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.040]   Who has the greater enjoyment of playing Minecraft?
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.600]   It's the people playing Minecraft,
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.200]   not the people watching the people playing Minecraft.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.880]   And so here's the reality.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.440]   Some of you guys are just trying to live through,
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.820]   live vicariously through other people's sight.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.480]   Like you just, you watch reels
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.240]   of your favorite Christian influencers
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.880]   who are seeing Jesus
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.520]   and you're trying to draft off their sight.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.240]   You know you can meet with the Jesus
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:05.280]   that they're meeting with.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.320]   Like you can just go see him for yourself.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.400]   You can sit and meet with him.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.120]   You can hear from him yourself.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.400]   You don't have to hear from him vicariously
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.360]   through someone else who is experiencing all the intimacy.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.960]   You can experience the intimacy that they're experiencing.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.400]   See Jesus for yourself.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.600]   So what does that mean?
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.440]   What do I mean, see Jesus for yourself?
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.560]   I'm just saying, meet with God yourself.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:38.040]   Make time tomorrow to sit down and open up his word
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.880]   and say, God, if this is your word,
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.020]   would you speak to me as I read?
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.780]   I want to hear from you.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.400]   And then talk back to him, pray.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.440]   And when you pray, believe he is listening.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.280]   He cares, he is with you.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.740]   He is in the room wanting to meet with you.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.260]   Another question to ask yourself is, are you distracted?
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.780]   This weekend I took one of my boys
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.320]   on a father-son trip to San Diego
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.560]   and we rented a Tesla through Turo, which was amazing.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.900]   But this Tesla had a video screen in the back
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.240]   and it had YouTube on it.
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.240]   And so he was watching YouTube videos
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.240]   of guys playing Minecraft in San Diego.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.520]   And we left the airport and we're driving into the city
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.720]   and I'm looking out and it is gorgeous.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.520]   I mean, I left concrete Dallas
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.160]   and I see water and there's boats
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.760]   and there's hills and classy architecture.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.160]   And I'm like, hey dude, look at this.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.560]   And he looks up, he's like, okay.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.000]   And then he looks back at his screen.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I'm like, dude, like this is, he's missing beauty.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.120]   Why? Because he's distracted.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.120]   I just wonder if that's our lives.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.000]   Like the reason you're not seeing Jesus
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.200]   is 'cause you're seeing everything else.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.640]   And God loves you too much.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   To show you all of himself
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:05.920]   when you're watching everything else.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.800]   And so what does this look like?
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.040]   Maybe it just means, look, if you're meeting with God,
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.880]   why would you want to be accessible to anyone else?
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.280]   Like turn your phone off.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.840]   It's like for 20 minutes.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.120]   Like why would you care about hearing from any influencer
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.840]   when you can meet with the God who made the influencer?
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:33.960]   And if he wants to meet with you, who cares?
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.840]   If anyone else wants to meet with you.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.240]   So just shut it off.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.400]   Like don't sit at your kitchen table
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.520]   when all your roommates are trying to cook breakfast
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.880]   and get out of the place.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.400]   Like be alone, get alone with God.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.520]   Drown out the distractions so that you can see him.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.640]   And then the last question I'd encourage you to answer
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:00.520]   is are you glancing instead of gazing at Jesus?
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.560]   This is a wording from A.W. Tozer.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:08.920]   Like are you just kind of quickly glancing at him
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.240]   or are you seeking to gaze at him?
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:14.640]   Like no one's love story is you know what,
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:18.800]   I pass by her running on the Katy Trail
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.880]   every Monday, Wednesday, Friday afternoon
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.920]   and I said hey to her every time
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.720]   and now we've been married for 20 years.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.520]   Like whose story is that?
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.920]   No one's.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:33.320]   'Cause no one meets and falls in love by a quick glance.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.920]   Hey, I don't know your name, hey.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.560]   No, you gotta ask someone out.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.880]   This isn't even a dating talk.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.640]   You should ask someone out, maybe.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:45.520]   You ask someone out, you take them out.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.080]   You go to dinner.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.360]   Like you look at them in the face.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   You get to know them.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.800]   You ask them questions.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   And as you gaze at them, you know what happens?
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   Is it cultivates your heart for them.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:07.440]   And so I'll just tell you this to say like
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.280]   I've shared this before but
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.600]   quality time comes from quantity of time.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:20.400]   Like my relationship with my kids,
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.120]   it's not based on me hanging out with my kids
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.400]   for five minutes a day.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.160]   Like no dad is like you know what,
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.320]   I'm crushing it for just five minutes a day.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.840]   I'm a great dad.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.560]   I feel super connected to my kids.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.160]   Kat and I's marriage, man, it is soaring.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.280]   Why, five minutes a day?
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.960]   Just hang out five minutes.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.080]   It's amazing, best five minutes of my day.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:49.040]   No, quality time, it's birthed out of quantity of time.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.880]   So my encouragement is just look at your schedule.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:58.920]   Change your priorities and just create more space for God.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   Why, so you can see Him.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.320]   Like get where you can see Him.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   Sit until you see Him.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.680]   And so what's your response gonna be to Jesus?
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.120]   What is the right response to the gift of Jesus?
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.760]   If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.920]   I wanna encourage you to investigate Him.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.560]   Maybe it's you just take the next 21 days
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.040]   and you read one chapter of John a day for 21 days
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.120]   just to investigate Him.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.760]   Don't be like my boys on movie night.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.320]   Don't dismiss something
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.160]   that you have never become familiar with.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.760]   If a miracle is happening in your life tonight,
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.600]   would you receive them?
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.200]   Like don't leave here.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:42.080]   If God brought you here for you to know Him, receive Him.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.280]   And then behold Jesus.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.880]   If you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.480]   I just wanna encourage you to behold Him.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.480]   Maybe you just stay right where you are tonight.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.320]   You don't rush out.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.200]   Maybe you go up to the prayer chapel
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:58.800]   where we're gonna have extended worship tonight.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.880]   Maybe you go out and you go to the loft
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.040]   and you go to next steps because you just want to know more
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.920]   how you can take next steps with Jesus in His church,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.040]   but behold Him tonight.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:16.080]   The gift of Jesus deserves the right response.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.640]   Investigate Him, receive Him.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.720]   Behold Him.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.720]   Let's pray together.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:27.120]   Lord Jesus, my hope and prayer is that every person
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.680]   in this room tonight would take a step with you.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.360]   God, that no one would leave here unmoved.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:39.200]   God, for the person who's not a Christian,
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.760]   Lord, I pray that you would just take them
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.360]   on a journey of investigation.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.560]   And as they investigate, I pray that they would find you.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.800]   God, for the Christian, I pray that even now
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.160]   you would open their eyes to see you more clearly.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.240]   And then for the person who doesn't know you,
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.360]   but is here because you have drawn them here.
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.880]   Miracle is happening in their life.
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.840]   If that's you right now,
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.760]   just wanna invite you in this moment
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.400]   to just repeat after me in the quietness of your own heart.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:06.840]   This isn't a rabbit's foot prayer.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.200]   I'm just trying to help you articulate to God
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.040]   what you know to be true.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.080]   You can just say, "Lord Jesus,
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.000]   "would you come into my life tonight?"
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Just say, "I want a relationship with you.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   "Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.640]   "Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.840]   "Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.120]   "And would you lead me in a new life
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.360]   "with you as my savior and my king?"
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:38.120]   Lord, we need you.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.600]   We love you.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.640]   God, I pray that over the coming weeks,
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.560]   we would be a people who behold your beauty.
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.520]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.820]   Amen.
