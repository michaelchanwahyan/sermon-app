1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,760
 - Well, good evening here in Dallas

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,220
 and to friends back in Fort Worth

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,600
 where I spend most Tuesday nights,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,920
 Houston and around the country.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,200
 Dialed In for Amnesia Part Two, we are back.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,140
 And I wanna start with a story.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,040
 Every once in a while, you find $36 flights to Boulder.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,680
 And when you do that, 100% of the time, you buy 'em.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
 So a group of friends and I just went,

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
 seven of us to be exact, went to Boulder

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
 and spent a day there, climbed a mountain.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,520
 And while we were there, a protest broke out in the street

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,440
 in kind of the downtown-ish area of Boulder.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,280
 Now, I don't know if you know,

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,880
 but there was a new president elected.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,120
 This was November 12th, the day we were there.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,500
 The election was just a few days removed

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,880
 and some people were upset about that.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,480
 And so they gathered, congregated.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,560
 There was an all-out protest.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
 And so just to give you kind of a picture

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,340
 of what's going on, I think 75 to 100 people,

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,040
 shouting, banners, you know, the whole deal,

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,120
 love trumps hate, everything you can imagine.

26
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,200
 Anti-governmental system, pretty aggressive chants.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,520
 It wasn't anarchy, let's just call it messy, all right?

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,700
 And so I started to look around

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,840
 and most of the folks who were participating in this

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,080
 just appeared and proudly,

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,980
 they wouldn't be upset with me giving them this description.

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,280
 They appeared to be living an alternative lifestyle

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,680
 and they waved that banner quite proudly.

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,700
 And so that's what they were about.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,760
 And so as the protest was going on,

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,240
 I thought, you know, when a protest happens,

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,080
 there's like a group of people that congregate

38
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 and then there's a whole separate group of people

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,960
 around them that congregate and kind of watch.

40
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,560
 We were in that second group.

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,220
 And I thought, you know, I'm kind of good on politics.

42
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,520
 I don't feel any need to get into that discussion today.

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,660
 But what I would love to do is maybe we can share the hope

44
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,320
 and love of Christ, you know, and maybe we can do that.

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
 And so what happened is he finishes the protest.

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,800
 He's leading the chants and, you know,

47
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,460
 he's yelling into the megaphone.

48
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,320
 And as soon as he finishes, he calls the next meeting,

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,240
 puts the megaphone down.

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,340
 And as soon as he does, well, some friends and I

51
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,700
 that were with us that day, we went up

52
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,780
 and we wanted to approach him.

53
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,860
 And we did that pretty quickly.

54
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,500
 And so again, if you want to get a really clear picture,

55
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,100
 like not well-kept, not well-groomed,

56
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,620
 like totally, like they're averaging

57
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,660
 about two showers a week.

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,480
 I'm giving you total honesty.

59
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
 And so I approached these guys

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,800
 to get into a discussion with them.

61
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,860
 And it looks like the Brady bunch is going to talk to him

62
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
 'cause we're not dressed like them.

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,820
 We don't look like them.

64
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
 And so everybody all of a sudden is kind of intrigued,

65
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,680
 like, oh, we're about to have a discussion here.

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,140
 And so then they gather around again.

67
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,320
 And so now we just want to have a little discussion

68
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,660
 where we get a chance to share the hope and love of Christ

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,740
 over any political system with our friends.

70
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,980
 And so we're in this conversation.

71
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,700
 And if one thing happened in that conversation,

72
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,620
 that's the reason I start with this story.

73
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,660
 There was a girl who interrupted the conversation

74
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,700
 pretty angrily, accused me of anger,

75
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,040
 but in her anger, in her angry accusation,

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,420
 she asked me a question.

77
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,420
 It was like a moment came where she was going to put down

78
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,980
 her anger and she was going to be polite.

79
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
 And like the manners like kicked in.

80
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,140
 And when that happened, she chose a sentence

81
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,820
 that no one has ever said to me before out of manners.

82
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,260
 She said this sentence and I'm being totally serious.

83
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,460
 She was totally sincere.

84
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,420
 She didn't say it for a laugh.

85
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,260
 She didn't do anything out of the ordinary.

86
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,100
 She was being kind.

87
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,960
 She said, "Do you identify as a white male?"

88
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,060
 That's what she said.

89
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,020
 And it wasn't like, you know,

90
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,940
 that's not how we introduce ourselves in Fort Worth, okay?

91
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,540
 And so I'm like, if you do,

92
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,780
 then you would be considered rude

93
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,820
 or you'd be making fun of somebody

94
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,020
 or maybe making a bad joke.

95
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,380
 And like, ooh, that's kind of insensitive.

96
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,140
 And so it would just be misunderstood.

97
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,020
 But she was being completely sincere,

98
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,940
 totally kindhearted even.

99
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,860
 This was her way of showing love and care and acceptance

100
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,720
 was just to ask me, do I identify as a white male?

101
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,980
 Which she politely also asked the guy

102
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,420
 that we were talking to.

103
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,700
 And so he answered yes, I answered yes.

104
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,580
 And the conversation went on.

105
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,040
 We did get a chance to share with them explicitly

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,780
 the hope and faith that we have in Christ.

107
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,340
 And both groups kind of parted high-fiving

108
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,660
 because they got to talk about what they wanted

109
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,800
 to talk about, which was politics.

110
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,460
 And we got to talk about what we wanted to talk about,

111
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,300
 which was Christ.

112
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,120
 And so everybody left happy.

113
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,180
 But there was that one sentence that stuck with me.

114
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,700
 And I realized she was so sincere.

115
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
 If I had told her, like, I feel five-five

116
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,900
 instead of six feet tall, she would have been,

117
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,740
 she'd be like, okay.

118
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,060
 She probably would have started looking right here.

119
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,900
 I mean, she was going to totally buy in.

120
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,620
 And so if I had told her that I was Asian,

121
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,020
 she would have totally played by those rules.

122
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,500
 If I had told her I felt like a woman,

123
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,860
 she would have called me ma'am out of respect,

124
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,300
 like not even to be funny.

125
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,500
 This is not a game to her.

126
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,040
 She is so serious and so sincere.

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,040
 And I realized this is not just a protester

128
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,760
 versus pastor conversation.

129
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,520
 This is an every person conversation.

130
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,980
 This is a me, personally conversation.

131
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,240
 Because what she said was, she used the word identify.

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,880
 But she could have used the word feel interchangeably.

133
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,800
 And so for her, catch this, don't miss this,

134
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,840
 or you'll miss us from the start if you miss this.

135
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,840
 She was saying that your feelings are your identity.

136
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,840
 The way you feel is who you are.

137
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,940
 So if you want to find out who you are,

138
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,900
 just look inside yourself, find where your feelings are,

139
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,760
 follow your feelings, and we'll just call that your identity.

140
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,040
 Your feelings decide your identity.

141
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,520
 She had wholeheartedly bought into that,

142
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,420
 and she was going to extend me the same privilege.

143
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,460
 And so she was fully convinced that to commit,

144
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,180
 or rather to commit to your feelings,

145
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,060
 is to find your identity.

146
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,140
 That's where she was.

147
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,660
 And I realized, man, this is not just something

148
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,020
 I should shake my head at.

149
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,340
 And this conversation this evening

150
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,940
 is not about what's going on in society

151
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,060
 in some other part of the country.

152
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,100
 I realized this is a me conversation.

153
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,820
 Because there has been a time in my life,

154
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,220
 and I realize much more often than I think,

155
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,020
 that my feelings and my identity actually don't agree.

156
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,880
 Not about gender, not necessarily about race.

157
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,640
 But I think back to the time I became a Christian.

158
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,180
 See, before I was a believer in Christ,

159
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,740
 before I was a follower of Jesus,

160
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,860
 I did whatever I felt like.

161
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,420
 If I felt like having sex, that's what I would do.

162
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,700
 If I felt like looking at pornography,

163
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,620
 that's what I would do.

164
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,420
 If I felt like running from the police,

165
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,620
 that's what I would do, and did, twice.

166
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,500
 Dad, I've never actually told you that, but that happened.

167
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,340
 And so,

168
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,660
 so whenever you are following a feeling,

169
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,280
 before you're a Christ follower, that's just who you are.

170
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,260
 So my feelings and my identity were exactly the same.

171
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,440
 I was the guy who did what I felt like.

172
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,920
 Feelings and identity were exactly the same.

173
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,220
 But then I became a Christian, in a moment.

174
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,460
 And my identity changed.

175
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,220
 Now, you heard David talk about that a little bit last week

176
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,580
 in Amnesia Part One.

177
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,220
 The old was gone and the new had come.

178
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,660
 And so my identity changed in a split second.

179
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,140
 What happened to my feelings was exactly nothing.

180
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,980
 I still felt like doing everything that I had done before.

181
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,060
 I was now a Christian who had an identity in Christ.

182
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,900
 I'd been given this brand new identity, slate clean,

183
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,660
 but the only problem was I still felt like looking at porn,

184
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,540
 having sex, running from the police,

185
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,060
 and just generally partying.

186
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,140
 And I was about to go to college.

187
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,820
 But this identity versus feelings clash.

188
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,620
 And so the question for us all tonight

189
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,220
 is not whether feelings are powerful.

190
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,480
 Can we agree feelings are powerful?

191
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 Hurts, pains, doubts, wants, desires, hopes, dreams,

192
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,100
 all these are incredibly powerful.

193
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,340
 Families start because somebody gets a feeling.

194
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,820
 Actually, because two people get a feeling.

195
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,660
 That's why you're here.

196
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,060
 Two people got a feeling.

197
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,460
 So feelings are powerful things.

198
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,500
 Families break apart because somebody gets a feeling.

199
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,420
 Some of you move cities because you got a feeling.

200
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,100
 Some of you are here right now for some reason

201
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,660
 that you just decided that you had a feeling

202
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,740
 you should come.

203
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,780
 Feelings are incredibly powerful things.

204
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,580
 The question is, the question for tonight is,

205
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,780
 which one should we commit to?

206
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,320
 Should we, as my friend from Boulder

207
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,180
 would politely encourage me,

208
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,380
 should we commit to our feelings and say,

209
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,780
 you know what, that's gonna be who I am.

210
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,900
 I'm gonna be the person who does what I feel like.

211
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,540
 When I do what I feel like, I'll find out who I am.

212
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,940
 Or should we, what if I told you

213
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,940
 that finding your identity

214
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,060
 was not a matter of following your feelings,

215
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,300
 but it was actually a matter of resisting them,

216
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,700
 sometimes for a long time,

217
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
 sometimes with much difficulty.

218
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,520
 And you don't have to tell me that feelings are difficult.

219
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,280
 I have had addictions.

220
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120
 I get it.

221
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,420
 Feelings are powerful.

222
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,540
 And I know some of you, even tonight,

223
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,880
 you're here and you've got a feeling

224
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,240
 that you wish you didn't have.

225
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,100
 You're like, I wish this feeling wasn't here.

226
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,940
 In fact, I've asked God to take it away.

227
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,420
 I wish that I didn't feel this way.

228
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,540
 And here you are, you're at the porch,

229
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,020
 and you're like, maybe the momentum of the porch,

230
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,060
 maybe somebody can sing it out or preach it out.

231
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,180
 We'll just porch it out.

232
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,900
 Like for some reason, you think this feeling could go away

233
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,020
 and you're sitting there hopeful, hopeful, hopeful

234
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,780
 that a feeling would disappear.

235
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,780
 And there it is.

236
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,220
 That's the power of a feeling.

237
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,040
 So we can all agree that feelings are powerful.

238
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,820
 And we can agree that feelings and identity

239
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,880
 can sometimes clash.

240
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,440
 That's just common human experience.

241
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,340
 The question for tonight is, which is a little less clear,

242
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,620
 which one should we commit to?

243
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,220
 Should we commit to our feelings and say,

244
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,240
 that's who we'll be, or should we commit to who we'll be?

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,240
 And then sometimes, with much pain, filter our feelings.

246
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,140
 That's the question for tonight.

247
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,180
 And so what I wanna do tonight is I'd love to introduce you

248
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,340
 to a man in the Bible that you might not have met before.

249
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,740
 He is in Genesis chapter 25, and his name is Esau.

250
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,700
 Esau is a man with a big identity from God,

251
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,460
 a huge identity from God, in fact,

252
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,880
 much greater than he even knew at the time.

253
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,440
 But the man with the big identity

254
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,740
 got a little feeling one day.

255
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
 And so I wanna show you as best I can

256
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,460
 from Genesis chapter 25, the way feelings and identity

257
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,660
 interact and which ones we should embrace

258
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,580
 and which one we should be prepared to resist.

259
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,060
 Now Esau, I said Esau was given an identity from God.

260
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,780
 You're gonna wanna understand this piece

261
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,140
 because it's what brings attention

262
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,040
 and interest to the story.

263
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,340
 So Esau had a big identity

264
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,060
 because he had something called a birthright.

265
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,560
 Now we don't do birthrights anymore.

266
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,660
 And so you wanna know what that is.

267
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,860
 A birthright consists of three things.

268
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,000
 One, when dad died, you got to be the ruler of the family.

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,220
 And so when dad died, it didn't turn into a democracy

270
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,260
 when dad died, you were the boss, okay?

271
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,400
 You were in control whenever dad died.

272
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,180
 So that's one thing, you had the right to rule.

273
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,340
 Secondly, you got a double portion of the inheritance.

274
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,780
 And so you were literally twice as rich

275
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,740
 as your brothers and sisters, so that's not a bad deal.

276
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,900
 And so if you had the birthright,

277
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,220
 you literally would receive twice the inheritance.

278
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,380
 And thirdly, and most importantly by far,

279
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,440
 if you had the birthright,

280
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,460
 let's say if you had the identity of the firstborn son

281
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,280
 who always got the birthright, firstborn son always.

282
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,880
 If you were given the identity of the birthright,

283
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,940
 you had a sense of blessing from God,

284
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,140
 a sense that God was with you,

285
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,260
 a sense that God was in your corner.

286
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,040
 It's kind of mystical, it's kind of hard to know,

287
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,780
 but in some ways that you wouldn't even understand

288
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,520
 as your life unfolded, if you had the birthright,

289
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,420
 you weren't just guaranteed the right to rule

290
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,680
 on a double portion of the inheritance,

291
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,100
 you were guaranteed that God was with you in a special way.

292
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,820
 Esau was a twin, but he beat his brother out of the womb

293
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,780
 by just a few minutes, okay?

294
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,220
 And so on the birthright deal, it's not like,

295
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,580
 oh, close, we'll have to split it up.

296
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,240
 I mean, he won, so he got out of the womb first,

297
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,580
 so he has 100% of the birthright.

298
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,760
 And his twin brother Jacob had zero, but Jacob was smart.

299
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,340
 And so as we'll see, the two boys grew up very differently

300
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,740
 and you will see, I hope, in a fascinating story,

301
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,780
 the way identity and feelings played out

302
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,380
 for this one man in Genesis 25.

303
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,220
 So here we go.

304
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,160
 One day when the twin boys were all grown up,

305
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
 the man with a big identity got a little feeling.

306
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,600
 Verse 27, "When the boys grew up,

307
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,760
 Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field."

308
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,560
 It says elsewhere in the scripture that he was hairy.

309
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,060
 I don't know why you include that detail,

310
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,900
 but that's in there.

311
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,440
 And so I think this guy's living Duck Dynasty cast member.

312
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,060
 Okay, so that's who Esau is.

313
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,560
 Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field,

314
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,520
 while Jacob, the younger twin without the birthright,

315
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,880
 was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.

316
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,340
 So he's like the inside guy.

317
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,480
 Isaac, that's dad, loved Esau because he ate of his game.

318
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,440
 It's like, duh, he's a daddy's boy, that's easy.

319
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,720
 But Rebecca, that's mama, loved Jacob.

320
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,180
 Okay, so Esau went and killed the food

321
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,180
 and Jacob did dishes.

322
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,200
 That's the way that worked, okay?

323
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,240
 So there's a daddy's boy and there's a mama's boy.

324
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,140
 That's the way that works.

325
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,660
 Verse 29, "Once when Jacob was cooking stew,"

326
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,200
 because that's what he did,

327
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,820
 "Esau came in from the field,"

328
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,280
 because that's what he did, "and he was exhausted."

329
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,760
 Now there's your feeling, there's your culprit,

330
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,400
 there's your problem, exhausted.

331
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,840
 Your translation might say famished,

332
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,900
 and he's really hungry.

333
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,000
 So it's some combination.

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,520
 So famished, exhausted,

335
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,680
 we don't really have an English word to translate this,

336
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
 but I'm convinced the best word is hangry.

337
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,640
 This is the first example of hanger in the Bible, okay?

338
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,380
 So we got some hunger, we got some anger,

339
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,360
 we got some fatigue, that's where Esau is.

340
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
 Now we know, some of you are like,

341
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,920
 don't elbow anybody next to you,

342
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,440
 but you know that's a powerful feeling, right?

343
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,400
 It can corrupt your behavior, all right?

344
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,640
 It can create some problems.

345
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840
 And so that's where Esau is,

346
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,060
 that's what he is feeling, and he walks in the door.

347
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,520
 "And Esau said to Jacob," this is awfully formal,

348
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,020
 you wouldn't say it this way, but he communicates,

349
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,480
 "Let me eat some of that red stew,

350
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,980
 "for I am having this feeling, for I am exhausted."

351
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,960
 Now this is a huge moment for a little brother,

352
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,640
 because older brother actually needs something for a change.

353
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,840
 Any younger brothers in here?

354
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,780
 Me too, it's tough, isn't it?

355
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,060
 Older brother never needs you, ever, right?

356
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,040
 It's like, can I drive your car?

357
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,180
 No, can I hang out with your friends?

358
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,880
 No, can we make up a handshake or something?

359
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,800
 No, I mean, you just can't get anything,

360
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,520
 like you can't get anything from your older brother.

361
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,640
 And then finally one day,

362
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,080
 older brother comes in and needs something.

363
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,060
 What a rich moment, right?

364
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,960
 And if you are a wise little brother,

365
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,400
 you will seize the moment, all right?

366
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
 And Jacob, deceptive and just downright smart,

367
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,780
 decides to negotiate and he swings for the fence.

368
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,400
 Verse 31, Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright.

369
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 "I'll take that."

370
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,200
 I'm so glad you laughed,

371
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,780
 because he should have gotten laughed at.

372
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,780
 That offer should have been just disregarded immediately.

373
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,740
 I mean, this is like, hey, I know what,

374
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,220
 let's trade your inheritance for a Whataburger.

375
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,540
 That's what just happened.

376
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,100
 And what's sad is some of you right now are like,

377
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,900
 Whataburger, that's pretty good, ooh.

378
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,320
 (congregation laughing)

379
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,980
 He should, I mean, who would do this?

380
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,140
 Who would trade a birthright?

381
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,660
 Who would trade, you could say, an identity?

382
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,780
 Who would trade something like that for a meal?

383
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,860
 And the answer is somebody with a feeling.

384
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,340
 Verse 32, Esau said, "I am about to die."

385
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,620
 I'm so glad he says this out loud.

386
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,460
 What?

387
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,700
 I'm about to die, what use is a birthright to me?

388
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,940
 Now that escalated quickly.

389
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,900
 One minute we're hungry,

390
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,700
 and the next minute we're about to die.

391
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,920
 Feelings will turn you into a complete drama queen.

392
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,500
 That's exactly what's happening to him.

393
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,340
 I'm about to die.

394
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,540
 Hey, let me help you, Esau, listen.

395
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,700
 People who are about to die from exhaustion,

396
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,380
 they don't come inside and announce they're about to die.

397
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,940
 They just stay outside and die.

398
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,460
 But he comes inside and is convinced in his feeling

399
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,460
 that he is about to die.

400
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,060
 He wants something so bad that he cannot think straight.

401
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,960
 You ever thought that?

402
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,620
 Oh, if I don't have that, I'm gonna die.

403
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,820
 If I don't drink that, I'm gonna die.

404
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,980
 If I don't touch that, I'm gonna die.

405
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,100
 If I don't click on that, I might die.

406
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,740
 Let me help you, you will not die.

407
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,100
 I've been there and you won't die.

408
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,480
 This is why, this is why JP says,

409
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,240
 "I trust myself the least when I really want something."

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,280
 This is why our senior leader here, Todd,

411
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,020
 says feelings may be real, but they are not reliable.

412
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,980
 And Esau's got the wheels turning and he is forgetting.

413
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,540
 This is a bad time to get amnesia about who you are,

414
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,000
 and he is forgetting his identity.

415
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,960
 And he's all set to follow his feelings.

416
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,280
 In verse 33, Jacob said, "Swear to me now."

417
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,360
 They're about to cut this deal.

418
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,840
 It's about to happen.

419
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,700
 This is the worst thing to watch.

420
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,480
 I can't stand, it's the worst.

421
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,600
 Just to watch this unfold and kind of slow-mo,

422
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
 it's like, are you kidding me?

423
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
 Are we really entertaining this?

424
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
 It makes me wish, I don't know about you,

425
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,240
 but it makes me wish that I could just like

426
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
 interrupt the story.

427
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
 And I know that's a little bit like,

428
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,240
 hey, you don't get to, I know that.

429
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,760
 But I wish that I could have a conversation with him.

430
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,600
 Don't you?

431
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,640
 I wish that I could talk with him.

432
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,000
 And now listen, I don't know what you would say,

433
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,840
 but here's what I would say.

434
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,900
 I would say, Esau, I know that feeling is really strong,

435
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,620
 and I know it's growing the more

436
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,800
 and the more you think about it.

437
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,860
 The rest of the world is just like blurring out,

438
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,600
 and all you can see is that.

439
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
 And all of a sudden, it's become the most satisfying thing

440
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,680
 in the world, and you're gonna die if you don't get that.

441
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,440
 And all of a sudden, just there's nothing else

442
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,420
 to think about.

443
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,880
 And it seems like it's gonna be extraordinarily satisfying.

444
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,280
 I've been there, and I understand that.

445
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,200
 But let me remind you of who you are.

446
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,040
 Let me remind you of your identity.

447
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,480
 Esau, you aren't just about to trade away your identity.

448
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
 You are about to trade away your very future with God.

449
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,640
 Because Esau, I know you have no idea what a book is,

450
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,160
 but your story is going to be written in a book,

451
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,240
 the most famous book of all time.

452
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,720
 And God, listen to this, God, who is big on titles,

453
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,360
 big on introductions, God Almighty, the all-powerful God,

454
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,140
 is going to introduce himself using your name.

455
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,560
 That's in your future.

456
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,760
 He is going to appear.

457
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
 This is what I would say to Esau.

458
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,560
 Esau, God is going to appear to a man named Moses.

459
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,600
 He's more famous than you'll ever be.

460
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,920
 Sorry, nothing I can do about that.

461
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,060
 But listen, God is going to introduce himself to Moses.

462
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,140
 And he's going to say, "Moses, I am the God

463
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,300
 "of Abraham, Isaac, and Esau."

464
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,100
 That is in your future.

465
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,900
 That's who you are.

466
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,260
 And if that's not enough for you, Esau,

467
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,560
 I wanna tell you one more.

468
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,540
 You have such a favored identity from God

469
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,540
 that there is going to be a savior of the world

470
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,300
 who doesn't just put a bandaid on things,

471
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,940
 who really fixes things.

472
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,700
 God's already put the plan in motion

473
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,660
 that the savior named Jesus would come,

474
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,180
 and that he, many years from now, Esau,

475
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,220
 he would be able and willing to bridge the gap

476
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,380
 between all of mankind and God.

477
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,460
 And he's your descendant.

478
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,380
 He's your grandson, the Messiah, the King,

479
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,740
 the savior, the hero, is in your lineage.

480
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,040
 And his book is the bestseller of all time.

481
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,500
 It's called "The New Testament," Esau.

482
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 And the first paragraph goes like this.

483
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,420
 It tells a story, and your name's on the front page.

484
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,420
 It says, "Abraham fathered Isaac, who fathered Esau."

485
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,720
 Now, I know your feeling is strong,

486
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,260
 but that's who you are.

487
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,300
 And I wasn't there to stop him.

488
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,780
 I wasn't there to stop him, to make his bad trade.

489
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,540
 And nobody usually comes to stop us.

490
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,860
 And it says,

491
00:18:51,860 --> 00:19:00,740
 "He swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.

492
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,220
 "Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew.

493
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,840
 "He ate and drank and rose and went on his way.

494
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,580
 "Thus Esau despised the birthright."

495
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,060
 The birthright was gone forever,

496
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,940
 and the feeling was gone for a little while.

497
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,180
 And it was one of the worst trades in history.

498
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,100
 And if you open your Bible today, this very evening,

499
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,060
 if you open your Bible to the right page,

500
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,820
 you will find that God introduced himself to Moses

501
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,920
 as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

502
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,220
 And the most famous book ever written, "The New Testament,"

503
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,780
 which is about the savior, the hero of all mankind,

504
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,820
 who would bridge the gap between God and man forever.

505
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,380
 If you go to the front page of that New Testament,

506
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,620
 it's called Matthew chapter one, and you start to read.

507
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,020
 It says on that page, in that very book, right this moment,

508
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,060
 it says, "Abraham was the father of Isaac,

509
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,220
 "who was the father of Jacob."

510
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,300
 Because of a feeling,

511
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,020
 because of an unchecked want, because of a desire,

512
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,920
 because of amnesia toward an identity.

513
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,420
 And it's unbelievable.

514
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,820
 You think, who would do something like this?

515
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,180
 Like, who would do that?

516
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,440
 What a terrible trade.

517
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,780
 This is one of the worst trades.

518
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,820
 Like, anybody with common sense can do that.

519
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,580
 Who in the world would be willing to make a trade like that?

520
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,300
 And the answer is, you might.

521
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,220
 People do it all the time.

522
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:29,300
 People throw away their families for 10 minutes of pleasure.

523
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,340
 That's a bad trade.

524
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,220
 How can that be?

525
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,540
 People get into relationships that they should not be in

526
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,580
 because of a feeling.

527
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,900
 People get out of relationships that they should be in

528
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,580
 because of a feeling.

529
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,480
 People forfeit a healthy sex life for pleasure right now.

530
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,660
 That's normal, unfortunately.

531
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,380
 Because feelings can cost you everything.

532
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,540
 Because they say, you know what?

533
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,420
 Just trade the ultimate for the immediate.

534
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,840
 Just trade the everything for something small.

535
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,580
 Trade something that's priceless

536
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,020
 for something really cheap.

537
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,900
 Trade something eternal for something that's just temporary.

538
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,900
 That's what feelings might and will tell you to do.

539
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,820
 Most people trade their identity for their feelings.

540
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,660
 That's a fact.

541
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,940
 And they miss everything that's valuable.

542
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,100
 So I just wanna ask you tonight,

543
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,140
 what is your bowl of stew?

544
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,060
 What is the thing, what is the thing

545
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,620
 that if your feelings go unchecked,

546
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,420
 it seems extraordinarily satisfying?

547
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,580
 It seems like there's nothing else in the room

548
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,780
 or out of the room that's worth feeling

549
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,220
 or thinking about except that one thing.

550
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,060
 What is it?

551
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,540
 Maybe it's money.

552
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,660
 You wanna be successful.

553
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,300
 You have a feeling where you're like,

554
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,180
 hey, success for me equals money

555
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,460
 and I wanna be the rich guy.

556
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,660
 And the feeling is going to turn into the identity.

557
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,060
 And so you're just following that feeling

558
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
 and following and following

559
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,580
 and thinking that an identity is going to come from that.

560
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,640
 And instead of finding an identity,

561
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,320
 you're losing the one God is trying to give you.

562
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,000
 Maybe it's a relationship.

563
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,940
 A relationship with someone

564
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,940
 that you know in your most honest moment

565
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,860
 is not the right one.

566
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,660
 You know God loves that person

567
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,040
 and Jesus died for that person,

568
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,080
 but you know in your very most honest moment,

569
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,900
 if you were to look at yourself openly,

570
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,100
 you know you're trading your future with God

571
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,500
 because you want a relationship

572
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,100
 worse than you want one with him.

573
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
 Happens all the time.

574
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,840
 Maybe it's some kind of sex.

575
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,100
 Maybe it's the kind of sex with a certain person

576
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,620
 or a certain kind of sex on your terms.

577
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,680
 And the world will applaud you and tell you good trade

578
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,980
 when you trade God for sex.

579
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,300
 And it's a really bad trade.

580
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,340
 I've tried that.

581
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,440
 It's not a good trade.

582
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,220
 You won't find who you are if you make that trade.

583
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,080
 You will lose who God says you are.

584
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,300
 Maybe it's affirmation.

585
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,580
 You know, you just really wanna be affirmed.

586
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,220
 If you could, you really wanna be affirmed.

587
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,620
 And so you start to think thoughts like this.

588
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
 You think, okay, you know what?

589
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,680
 I'll let him come up and talk to me,

590
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,900
 but I'm not gonna let him buy me a drink.

591
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,420
 Okay, I'll let him buy me a drink,

592
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,360
 but I'm not gonna walk out with him.

593
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,340
 Okay, I'll walk out with him,

594
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,620
 but I'm not gonna let him walk me to the door.

595
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,700
 Okay, I'll let him walk me to the door,

596
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,580
 but I'm not gonna let him come inside.

597
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,540
 Okay, I'm gonna let him come inside,

598
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,860
 but I'm not gonna let him lay down with me.

599
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
 Okay, I'll let him lay down with me, but.

600
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,620
 And before you know it,

601
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
 who you are and who you want to be

602
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,900
 is nowhere to be found.

603
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,460
 You forgot because of a feeling,

604
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,900
 because of a desire, because of a want.

605
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,540
 And the good news is you can make bad trades for a lifetime

606
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,680
 and you can never lose God's love.

607
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,520
 Did you know that?

608
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 God's love is permanent.

609
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,440
 You cannot lose God's love in a million years.

610
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,280
 You can lose God's best plan for you in five minutes.

611
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,500
 You can lose it right now.

612
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,580
 You can lose it in a moment.

613
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,660
 You can lose it with a decision.

614
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,360
 That's the power of a feeling.

615
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,100
 Now, I've had this little voice in the back of my head

616
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,040
 as I've been talking,

617
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,440
 and I know many of you feel like,

618
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,700
 well, that would have been helpful to know about a year ago,

619
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,180
 or that would have been helpful to know about five years ago

620
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,360
 or maybe even 10 years ago.

621
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,580
 That would have been really nice to know.

622
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,420
 But I want to tell you this.

623
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,240
 We can't talk our way out of the past,

624
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,680
 but we can follow God's identity for us into the future.

625
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,920
 You can't change the past, but guess what?

626
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,720
 Paul, who wrote the New Testament, some of it,

627
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,520
 he knew, he knew his past was gross,

628
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,840
 but he said, "Forgetting what's behind

629
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,020
 "and straining toward what's ahead,

630
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,600
 "I press on to take hold of Christ."

631
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
 All right?

632
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,580
 So we can't undo the past.

633
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,680
 You can't undo your past bad trades,

634
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,460
 but you can hear God's identity for you

635
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,080
 and then filter your feelings in the future.

636
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,920
 And so I just want to help you make a plan

637
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,900
 to do that if you would.

638
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,400
 All right, so here are a couple of ways that you can do that.

639
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,920
 Number one is to simply make a plan.

640
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,520
 One, make a plan.

641
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,400
 Nobody plans to throw their identity away.

642
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,940
 They don't plan not to.

643
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,800
 Nobody plans to throw their identity away.

644
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,060
 They just don't plan not to.

645
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,160
 If you don't know what to plan against,

646
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,200
 you are already without a chance.

647
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,940
 Like you have to know what to plan against.

648
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,320
 I know exactly what mine are.

649
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,080
 It's sex and selfishness.

650
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,660
 I got married three months ago

651
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,740
 and I work on a church staff.

652
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,540
 If you think that means the opposite gender

653
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,940
 is no longer a temptation, you are dead wrong.

654
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,960
 It is a problem.

655
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,460
 It still can be a very attractive bowl of stew to me.

656
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,020
 Selfishness is another one for me.

657
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,620
 I know that.

658
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
 Selfishness, meaning I think about me

659
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,600
 when I should be thinking about my wife.

660
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,780
 I think about me when I should be thinking about my job.

661
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,580
 I think about me when I should be thinking about you

662
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,980
 right now instead of hoping you like this sermon.

663
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,760
 Sex and selfishness, those are bowls of stew for me.

664
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,180
 They tempt me to make a bad trade.

665
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,500
 They tempt me to trade the ultimate for the immediate.

666
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,720
 And so what are yours?

667
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,120
 You've got to know and you've got to make a plan.

668
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,560
 Here's one idea.

669
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,340
 Stop putting yourself in situations

670
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,180
 where the situation has all the leverage.

671
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,020
 You know what I mean by that?

672
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,360
 Like, hey, here's an idea.

673
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,120
 Don't go out into the woods without a lunch

674
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,360
 and come back hungry and thirsty

675
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,640
 where your little brother is in control of everything.

676
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,920
 'Cause you know he cooks.

677
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,960
 And you know he lies.

678
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
 Why would you go out there and get yourself tired

679
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,600
 and come in this room and think everything's gonna be okay?

680
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
 Stop doing that.

681
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
 Here's how we do this.

682
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,840
 Some of you are like mystified

683
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,200
 because you can't go to the bar

684
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,760
 without getting in a bar fight.

685
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,480
 You're like, I gotta find a way to outsmart the situation,

686
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,680
 man, like I can't go to the bar without getting in a bar fight

687
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,760
 like I think I'm going to

688
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,480
 and then every time it's like bar fight, you know,

689
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,320
 it's crazy.

690
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,280
 Listen, let me help you.

691
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
 Stop going to the bar.

692
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,120
 You just outsmarted the whole thing, all right?

693
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,800
 You just stop going.

694
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,880
 Make a plan, don't go there.

695
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,720
 And I know some of you are like,

696
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,840
 oh, you know, that's just who I am.

697
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,880
 You know, that's kind of my thing.

698
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,040
 You know, I'm a bar guy, you're a dumb guy.

699
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,600
 (congregation laughing)

700
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,280
 Stop going there.

701
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,860
 Make a plan, make a plan.

702
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,560
 Don't put yourself in a situation

703
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,600
 where the situation has all the leverage.

704
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,640
 Secondly, widen the circle.

705
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,560
 Tell people your feelings, tell them what you're feeling.

706
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,860
 I know that is so scary to some of you guys.

707
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,240
 Tell people what you're feeling, invite them in.

708
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,560
 This is what you do at 2 a.m.

709
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,760
 Okay, when you are tempted to get up and masturbate.

710
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,040
 You're like, 2 a.m.?

711
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,880
 Yeah, 2 a.m., you call them and you say,

712
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,720
 hey, here's what's going on,

713
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,360
 that thing that's a really bad idea.

714
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,080
 You know what, it feels like a really good idea right now.

715
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,720
 And so can someone talk me off the ledge here?

716
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,240
 I'm sorry I woke you up, but guess what?

717
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,440
 We're supposed to keep watch on each other,

718
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,200
 says the Bible, and this is what you signed up for

719
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
 if you keep a watch on me, all right?

720
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,800
 And so I'm just gonna let you know

721
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
 what's happening right now, all right?

722
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,280
 Number two, widen the circle.

723
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,860
 Let somebody know, let somebody in.

724
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,280
 Number three, count the cost.

725
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,760
 Slow the situation down.

726
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,360
 Say the choice out loud.

727
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,700
 It's not a guaranteed fix,

728
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,500
 but you'd be surprised how much you slow down

729
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,480
 if you start to talk out loud.

730
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,560
 Say things like this to yourself.

731
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,120
 I'm about to trade my birthright for a bowl of stew.

732
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,680
 Say things like that out loud.

733
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,240
 Hey, I'm about to go in big debt

734
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,040
 because I feel like I should drive a better looking car.

735
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,800
 I'm about to throw away my purity

736
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,080
 so that I can enter into a promiscuous lifestyle

737
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,960
 because that feels good.

738
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,160
 Say the choice out loud.

739
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,440
 You'll be surprised how much you slow down

740
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,840
 when you hear the price tag.

741
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,440
 Make a plan, widen the circle, and count the cost.

742
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,540
 And the last thing I wanna say

743
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,520
 is we know that this is not easy.

744
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,660
 This is really hard.

745
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,580
 It is hard to fight feelings.

746
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,260
 It is much easier to embrace your feelings

747
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,980
 and say that's who I am.

748
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,660
 If I feel that desire, want, pain, hurt,

749
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,300
 I'm just gonna follow that until it becomes who I am.

750
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,860
 It is hard work to fight feelings

751
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,300
 and filter your feelings through your identity

752
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,420
 that's from God.

753
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,540
 And I want you to know that we at least

754
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,340
 have an example in Christ.

755
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,520
 Did you know that Christ one time had an opportunity

756
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,320
 to follow his feelings or to follow God's will for his life?

757
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,160
 He had that opportunity.

758
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,120
 You know, Jesus was fully God and fully human.

759
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,320
 He was fully human.

760
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,920
 He experienced the full force of all human emotions.

761
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,520
 He knows what it is to be human.

762
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,440
 He knew it.

763
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,740
 And the night he was going to be arrested

764
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,160
 for sins he did not commit,

765
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,360
 there was a moment where Jesus,

766
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,120
 with all of his humanity, did not feel

767
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,520
 like doing what he came to do.

768
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,720
 It's in Matthew chapter 26.

769
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,060
 It says, "Jesus said to them,

770
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,880
 "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death."

771
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,180
 That's a feeling, a big one.

772
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,280
 The stress was so much he sweated blood, we're told.

773
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,020
 And going a little farther, he fell on his face and said,

774
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,640
 "Father, if it's possible, let this cup pass from me."

775
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,300
 Meaning, if any way, I don't wanna battle this anymore.

776
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,140
 God, take this away.

777
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,120
 You ever prayed about like that, about a feeling?

778
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,960
 God, take this away.

779
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,920
 I don't wanna do this anymore.

780
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,760
 I'm not sure.

781
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,260
 Is this the right thing?

782
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,480
 And then he says, "Nevertheless,"

783
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,200
 meaning no matter what,

784
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,060
 "not as I will, not as I feel,

785
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,380
 "but as you will."

786
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,060
 And he laid his feelings down,

787
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,200
 to experience feelings that he should never have had

788
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,800
 to experience, so that we can experience things

789
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,000
 that we never deserved.

790
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,300
 That's what Jesus did.

791
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,520
 The hero, the son of God.

792
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,780
 And I know some of you are like,

793
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,240
 well, that didn't help me, he's Jesus.

794
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,480
 I mean, he's perfect, right?

795
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,200
 Jesus experienced every kind of weakness that we have.

796
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,300
 And the scripture says, even still,

797
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,840
 the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead

798
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,280
 dwells in you.

799
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,680
 It also says, no temptation has seized you.

800
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,520
 That's not common.

801
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,760
 God's faithful.

802
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
 He'll provide a way.

803
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,120
 And so I am not up here to tell you

804
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,120
 to just grit up and ball your fists and say,

805
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,160
 you can do it, because listen, you can't do it.

806
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,480
 I'm saying with Christ, you can do it.

807
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,840
 It can be done.

808
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 Let's pray together.

809
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,580
 God, will you give us the presence of mind

810
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,820
 not to get amnesia when it counts, God.

811
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,780
 Not to embrace feelings, but to filter them,

812
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,300
 to think through them, to consider our wants,

813
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,340
 to consider our pains, to consider our doubts,

814
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,220
 to consider where they're driving us

815
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,820
 and where they are taking us.

816
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,420
 Help us to slow down, God.

817
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,460
 Not to try to be good people,

818
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,820
 but because the only man who ever was good

819
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,900
 was willing to slow down and say, God, not as I will.

820
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,540
 I don't feel like doing this, God, but not as I feel.

821
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,100
 But as you will.

822
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,420
 Help us, God, to be the kind of people

823
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,420
 who say, nevertheless, God, no matter what, God,

824
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,700
 if I'm in this battle forever,

825
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,500
 no matter how much it hurts, God,

826
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,820
 I am going to trust you.

827
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,380
 I will not bow to a feeling.

828
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,500
 Not in the middle of the night, not in the middle of the day.

829
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,960
 Not by my strength, God, but only by yours.

830
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,860
 Thank you, Jesus Christ, Son of God,

831
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,500
 that you showed us how to do that exact thing.

832
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,580
 We are not strong, God.

833
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,860
 We are weak, and we need you desperately

834
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,420
 to tell us who we are.

835
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,700
 Save us from the futility of going off

836
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,980
 and trying to find out who we are

837
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,260
 by following our feelings.

838
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,220
 Help us, God, to listen to you when you say who we are.

839
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,980
 You have authority to say who we are.

840
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,540
 No one else gets a chance.

841
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,480
 You tell us, God, and then help us follow you,

842
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,860
 because we are gonna follow our feelings

843
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,100
 in every wrong direction.

844
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,380
 Help us, God, to submit ourselves to you

845
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,580
 and entrust ourselves to you who judge justly,

846
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,540
 just as Christ did.

847
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:06,540
