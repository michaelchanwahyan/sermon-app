00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:31,940
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,340
 Porch, how we doing? We doing OK tonight?

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,700
 Great to see you.

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,340
 You look good as always.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,740
 Hey, I'm really eager for where the Lord is taking us

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,380
 this evening.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,880
 But before we get into it, I do want

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,740
 to give a special shout out to all of Porch Live

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,660
 that is joining us from all over the nation.

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,740
 We genuinely believe-- and I'm going to speak right

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,240
 into the camera here for a minute--

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,860
 that God can meet with anyone, anytime, in any place,

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,820
 including you.

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,900
 And so we're so glad that you would tune in with us here

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,400
 this evening.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,060
 Special shout out to Porch Live Des Moines, Porch Live Boise,

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,140
 and Porch Live Scottsdale.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,660
 So glad that y'all are joining us here

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,380
 and with what God's doing.

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,540
 Well, when I was in high school, our youth group

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,180
 would take a backpacking trip to Colorado

23
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,420
 every couple of years.

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
 So over the course of my high school time,

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,180
 I was able to go on three different trips.

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,460
 Now, the first time I went on a backpacking trip,

27
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,860
 I was totally inexperienced.

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,420
 I didn't know anything about what I was to expect

29
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,620
 or what it looked like to hike up a mountain.

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,420
 You see, I had gone camping before,

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,500
 but I'd never been backpacking before.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,060
 And so I was absolutely dependent upon people around me.

33
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,760
 I didn't know what kind of gear to bring

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,180
 or what kind of food to pack.

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,140
 I showed up, and I just expected people

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,500
 to help me along the way.

37
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,340
 But what I found as I showed around

38
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,540
 for my third and final trip, I had a little bit more

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,780
 experience under my belt.

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,460
 I knew what it looked like to scope out a really good campsite,

41
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,780
 how to predict and endure the elements.

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,660
 I knew what gear to bring.

43
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,020
 I knew exactly what it looked like to make your way up

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,980
 an ideal trail.

45
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,460
 I could strategically map myself up a mountain.

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,980
 I felt like my days of being a novice to the trail

47
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,100
 were behind me.

48
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,820
 And I was at last one with the wilderness.

49
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,900
 When you go backpacking, there's a variety of things

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,060
 that you need to make sure you bring with you.

51
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,940
 The normal, everyday, standard packing list.

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,620
 You need things like a rain jacket, a sleeping bag.

53
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,540
 You need a beanie to put on 'cause it may be cold

54
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,660
 in the mornings and the evenings.

55
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,380
 You need to make sure that you also bring hiking boots.

56
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,020
 And there's just a whole list

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,060
 that you need to make sure you have.

58
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,780
 Things that we could probably predict

59
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,980
 if we pass the microphone around.

60
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,540
 We could make sure that we map it all out.

61
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,340
 But one thing that I brought with me

62
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,300
 that was not so standard to the packing list

63
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,840
 is I brought with me a toilet seat.

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,700
 Which may feel odd.

65
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,060
 That may feel odd, I know.

66
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,540
 But this was a luxury that I had parted ways with

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,860
 in years past.

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,420
 And yet this time, in my ingenuity,

69
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,060
 I knew that I could bring one with me.

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,540
 That I could actually buy one from the store.

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,580
 I could fasten it to a frame.

72
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,300
 I could attach it to my pack

73
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,500
 and I could utilize it with dual functionality.

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,540
 It could be my lawn chair when sitting around the campfire,

75
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,820
 as well as my lavatory, whatever nature called.

76
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,060
 I made sure to bring a toilet seat with me.

77
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,380
 Which you might hear and think, man, that is brilliant.

78
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,020
 And my 18 year old self would have tended to agree.

79
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,780
 Except for the fact that it kind of hurt my credibility

80
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,460
 as the mountain man that I aspired to be.

81
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,980
 Because the other wilderness guides,

82
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,380
 the ones that were particularly leading my group,

83
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,360
 they thought I was just trying to be funny.

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,780
 They looked at me and they saw something

85
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,840
 that was abnormal to the normal mountain hiking experience.

86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,700
 And so as they looked upon my outfitting gear,

87
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,540
 they said, man, this doesn't look normal.

88
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,100
 And so my credibility took a shot as did my ego.

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,820
 And what I realized is I did look out of place to them

90
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,820
 because you see, it doesn't make sense in their world

91
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,900
 for me to hike up a mountain with something

92
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,500
 so uncharacteristically typical of the experience.

93
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,020
 You see, I had aspired to a new way of life,

94
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,860
 to climbing up this hiking trail.

95
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,660
 But I was carrying along strapped to my pack

96
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,520
 something from my old way of life.

97
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,860
 I had set out into the wild,

98
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,220
 but I was carrying with me a piece of the city.

99
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,920
 Why do I tell you that?

100
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,940
 Because in the same way, when we walk with Jesus,

101
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,960
 we look equally confusing.

102
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,020
 When we claim a new life in Christ,

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,720
 but we have a piece of our old self strapped on.

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,500
 We walk into the world and people see what we say,

105
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,260
 and yet they look at different aspects of who we are

106
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,860
 and it looks inconsistent.

107
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,700
 It looks confusing.

108
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,700
 It looks funny to the way in which we now claim to live.

109
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,100
 You see Colossians 1:13,

110
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,860
 what Paul unpacked for us in the very first chapter

111
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,140
 of this letter that we've been working through

112
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,940
 is that God has delivered us from the domain of darkness

113
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,260
 and he has transferred us into the kingdom

114
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,860
 of his beloved son.

115
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,300
 He has transferred us, he has transplanted us,

116
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,260
 he has relocated us from one place to another place,

117
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,760
 from death into life.

118
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,300
 In the same way that you would transplant a heart.

119
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,140
 What do you do?

120
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,660
 You take it from a dead body

121
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
 and you put it into a living body.

122
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,500
 So has Christ done with us.

123
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,940
 He has taken us from a dead set of circumstances

124
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,140
 and he has moved us into a living set of circumstances.

125
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,320
 And because that's true,

126
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,180
 there's a way in which we should live.

127
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,580
 Like our whole life should characteristically,

128
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,740
 fundamentally look different

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,260
 and there should be nothing about us

130
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,980
 that is consistent with our old way of life.

131
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,140
 Instead, we should be moving forward

132
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,220
 in a manner that accords with who he is himself.

133
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,140
 So the question for us tonight is what does that look like?

134
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,380
 And how do we know if in fact we're actually living in it?

135
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
 That's the question we're addressing.

136
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,520
 And in order to do it,

137
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,120
 we're gonna be working through Colossians chapter three.

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,180
 So if you have a Bible, you can grab it.

139
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,420
 Scripture is gonna be on the screens as well.

140
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,100
 So you can look at it there if you want.

141
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,780
 But as we make our way through Colossians chapter three,

142
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,680
 Paul is gonna help us identify, do we look the part?

143
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
 Do we look like Jesus?

144
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,700
 If our life is now hidden in him,

145
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,280
 is the way in which we're living consistent

146
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,900
 with that new reality?

147
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,540
 What you also need to know is that tonight,

148
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,660
 we're gonna cover 17 total verses.

149
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,460
 That's a lot of page to cover.

150
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,980
 And so we're gonna be flying over it at 30,000 feet.

151
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,740
 We're not gonna get down into the weeds of it all.

152
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,460
 We'll drip down occasionally

153
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,540
 just to catch a couple of small details,

154
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,780
 but we're gonna fly over it

155
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,460
 because I just want you to catch the main strokes

156
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,600
 of what Paul is writing for us.

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,180
 And then lastly, what you need to know

158
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,300
 is that the main point of the book of Colossians,

159
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,500
 which I have hammered and hammered and hammered

160
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,180
 over the last several weeks since we've been in this series

161
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,500
 is that if you want greater maturity in life,

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,320
 you need greater clarity of Christ.

163
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,260
 If you want greater maturity in life,

164
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,340
 which so many of us do,

165
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,980
 like we're okay with who we are,

166
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,380
 but we wanna be more.

167
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,860
 Like we wanna aspire to a new level.

168
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,680
 If that's you, if you want maturity,

169
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,520
 then the way you get there is you get clarity.

170
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,700
 And Paul knows it.

171
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,780
 That's why as we've been walking

172
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,980
 through the book of Colossians chapter one and chapter two

173
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,080
 are all about seeing Jesus.

174
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,020
 That's what it's about.

175
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,420
 Colossians one and two, it's all doctrinal in nature.

176
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,620
 Chapter one, it's all about the supremacy of Jesus.

177
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,620
 Chapter two, it's all about the sufficiency of Jesus.

178
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,060
 And yet, as you come to chapter three,

179
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,760
 like a hinge on a door,

180
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,900
 we transition from a doctrinal set of teaching

181
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,340
 to a practical set of teaching.

182
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,540
 Now that you have clarity,

183
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,860
 let's move into maturity.

184
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,020
 That's Paul's point.

185
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,760
 That's where he's going this evening.

186
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,000
 That's what he wants to help us understand.

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,100
 And so this is what he says.

188
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,580
 He begins to unpack what it looks like

189
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,680
 to be a mature follower of Jesus.

190
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,580
 He says in verse one,

191
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,520
 "If then you've been raised with Christ,

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,500
 seek the things that are above.

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,480
 Where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God,

194
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,320
 set your minds on things that are above

195
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,900
 and not on things that are on the earth.

196
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,920
 For you have died and your life is hidden

197
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
 with Christ in God.

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,520
 When Christ who is your life appears,

199
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,400
 then you also will appear with him in glory."

200
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,560
 Paul starts with what seems like such a simple statement,

201
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,160
 and yet it is loaded with so much truth.

202
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,480
 It's so very profound.

203
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,760
 He says, "If then you've been raised with Christ,

204
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,880
 then set your mind."

205
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,280
 He gives us a conditional statement.

206
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,720
 It's if this has happened, then do this instead.

207
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,440
 You see, what he knows is the implications

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,080
 that if we are now raised with Christ,

209
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,560
 we must have died with Christ.

210
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
 That's the only way that you can rise.

211
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,120
 You have to die before you can rise.

212
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
 That's what he unpacked in Colossians 2, verse 20.

213
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
 He said, "If with Christ,

214
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
 you die to the elemental spirits of the world."

215
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
 Why?

216
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,000
 "As if you were still alive in the world,

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
 do you submit to regulations?"

218
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,480
 You're no longer alive in the world.

219
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,080
 You're alive in Jesus.

220
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,140
 And since it's the case, you should look like Jesus.

221
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,360
 So what does that look like?

222
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,640
 Well, the first thing he tells us

223
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,560
 is that we should set our minds on the meaningful

224
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
 and not the momentary.

225
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,920
 Set your mind on the meaningful and not the momentary.

226
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,960
 If you're doing a Christian fit check,

227
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,000
 if you're walking up to the mirror

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
 and you're trying to evaluate,

229
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,760
 "Do I look like Jesus?"

230
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,840
 This is the first thing,

231
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,320
 because he set his mind on the meaningful

232
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,400
 and not the momentary, and we should do so similarly.

233
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,880
 You see, we have been transitioned

234
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,560
 from one state of being to a new state of being.

235
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,880
 It was a cause and effect statement.

236
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,780
 If you've been raised, so then set your mind.

237
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,040
 Like we said earlier,

238
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,560
 there was a true transplantation of you

239
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 from a life in the dark to now a life in the light.

240
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,960
 So it's kind of like this.

241
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,260
 When you move into a brand new home,

242
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,360
 that home has absolutely no power.

243
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,560
 And so it's unlivable, right?

244
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,440
 That home has no power until you choose to turn it on.

245
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,600
 And when you turn it on, that house is coursing with power.

246
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
 Like now it's alive.

247
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,600
 Now it is livable.

248
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,440
 And yet, how do you know that the house is alive?

249
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
 Not just by turning the power on,

250
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,300
 but by turning a light on, by flipping the switch.

251
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,280
 You see, in the same way, salvation is like,

252
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,640
 God has stepped into your life

253
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,000
 and he has turned the power on.

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,640
 And yet, as we now walk with Jesus,

255
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,000
 we flip one switch after the next.

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
 And as we flip those switches,

257
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,080
 what happens is we see evidence of that power in our life.

258
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,280
 We see that we are becoming more like him.

259
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,380
 We see proof of the power in us.

260
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,080
 That's what Paul's talking about.

261
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,520
 That's what he's getting at when he says,

262
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,920
 "Hey, you should increasingly set your mind

263
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,760
 "on things that are above.

264
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,320
 "You should flip one switch and then the next switch

265
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,160
 "and then the next switch.

266
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,380
 "And you should turn all the lights on

267
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,480
 "because you have a power within your midst,

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,200
 "within your life that is characteristic of Jesus."

269
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,240
 He uses a word in Greek called phreno.

270
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
 Phreno is really interesting.

271
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,780
 That's the word he uses to set your mind.

272
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,080
 It's interesting because it incorporates

273
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,800
 both aspects of thinking.

274
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,980
 It incorporates the cognitive aspect of thinking,

275
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,840
 as well as the instinctive aspect of thinking.

276
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,040
 So what he's saying is that you should set your mind

277
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,960
 in a way where you consider the information

278
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,400
 you have about Jesus,

279
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,120
 as well as the inspiration you have from his life.

280
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,040
 You need facts to know and you need fuel to burn on.

281
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,020
 That's what you should do.

282
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,720
 You should set your mind in such a way

283
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,000
 that that is happening for you.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,720
 So how do you set your mind?

285
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,000
 What does that actually look like?

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
 You read his word.

287
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,480
 Thank you, Kylan, for telling me something I already knew.

288
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,740
 Now you read his word, not occasionally, but daily.

289
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,520
 And you read his word, not casually, but intentionally.

290
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,400
 And you pray to him, not just heaping up requests.

291
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

292
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
 Help me, help me, help me.

293
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,360
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

294
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,660
 No, you don't just pray to him your requests.

295
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,520
 You pray to him in such a way

296
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,240
 that simply enjoys the pleasure of his company.

297
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,560
 That just simply chooses to need nothing from him

298
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
 other than he himself.

299
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,340
 You ask hard questions.

300
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,000
 Anybody in here ever had a hard question

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,920
 that the Bible raised?

302
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
 Ask it.

303
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,280
 But don't pawn the work of answering it off

304
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,720
 on someone else's interpretation.

305
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,600
 You go do the work yourself.

306
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,040
 You go spend time and you chase down the answers

307
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
 because what's gonna happen

308
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,600
 is you're going to acquire new information about Jesus

309
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,320
 and you're gonna acquire new inspiration about Jesus

310
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,440
 and you're gonna begin to set your mind

311
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,920
 in a way that leads you to consider him as better.

312
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,600
 That's what he's pointing to.

313
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,200
 You're gonna set your mind on the meaningful

314
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,900
 and not the momentary.

315
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,320
 Why does this matter?

316
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
 Why does it matter what we pay attention to?

317
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,860
 Because what you behold impacts who you become.

318
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,760
 What you behold impacts who you become,

319
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,900
 which is why so many of us in here,

320
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,480
 we feel a deep sense of instability in our life.

321
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,140
 Like Isaiah 26, three, it says,

322
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,440
 "You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you

323
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,260
 "because he trusts in you."

324
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,540
 Man, trust sounds great.

325
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,380
 That kind of stability sounds awesome

326
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,960
 because in my life, I don't have any sense of stability.

327
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,840
 Things feel crazy.

328
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,380
 They feel out of control.

329
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,200
 What then are you focusing on?

330
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:12,600
 You see, often what we do is we focus on the momentary.

331
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,800
 We think, man, if I get that job, if I advance in my career,

332
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,300
 then I'm gonna have the kind of life that I want.

333
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,160
 Or if I get that kind of relationship,

334
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,440
 then I'm gonna get the kind of happiness

335
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,300
 that I've always wanted.

336
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,560
 Or if I get involved into that kind of network

337
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,920
 within that social group,

338
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,860
 I'm gonna afford myself the sort of opportunities

339
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,680
 I've always wanted.

340
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
 Or if I work on my appearance and I slave at the gym

341
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
 and I scrutinize my diet,

342
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,200
 I can get the kind of acceptance that I've always wanted.

343
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,480
 And yet what you find is you're just as unstable

344
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,480
 and you're just as insecure as you were when you first began.

345
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
 Friends, listen to me.

346
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,880
 Like your life is not hidden in your job.

347
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,700
 Your life is not hidden in your relationship.

348
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,200
 It's not hidden in your popularity.

349
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,680
 It's not hidden in the approval of other people.

350
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,560
 It's not hidden in your hobbies

351
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,760
 and experiences and activities.

352
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,840
 It's not hidden in any of those things.

353
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,560
 Your life is meant to be hidden in Christ.

354
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,520
 That's where it's supposed to be found.

355
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,380
 And so if you feel unstable and tossed about

356
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,700
 by the winds and waves of this world,

357
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,560
 it's because you're not focusing on what matters.

358
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,360
 It's because you're not thinking about what's meaningful.

359
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,800
 God, you, you keep him in perfect peace

360
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,480
 whose mind is stayed on you.

361
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
 If he trusts in you.

362
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,760
 I remember when my dad taught me to drive a boat.

363
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,560
 He's like, son, the best way for you to drive

364
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,080
 a straight line is to pick something out

365
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,440
 on the shoreline ahead.

366
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,040
 Something that's immovable, that's constant, that's fixed.

367
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,840
 Because if you point yourself at that,

368
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,340
 if you keep your eyes set there,

369
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,080
 you will drive a straight line.

370
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,680
 You will have stability in your course.

371
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,620
 What happens when you don't do that?

372
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,200
 When you look at the waves around

373
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,040
 or the boats that are passing by,

374
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,240
 you swerve all over the place.

375
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,640
 And yet, if I keep my eyes fixed on what's immovable,

376
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,340
 on what's constant, if I keep them fixed on Jesus,

377
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,100
 then I will have stability.

378
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,860
 What you focus on matters.

379
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,300
 So set your mind on what's meaningful.

380
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
 Now, some of you, you're in here and you're like, man,

381
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,180
 Kylan, I am.

382
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:25,060
 I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not

383
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,980
 like succumbing to the pressure of, of, of, of,

384
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,220
 of arriving in my career or, or, or falling prey

385
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,160
 to the opinions and approval of other people.

386
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,560
 I know the dangers of all of those things.

387
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,600
 And I'm not worried about that.

388
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,440
 Like I'm, I'm trying to focus on what's meaningful.

389
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,720
 I am doing everything you said.

390
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
 I'm spending time in the word and I'm praying to the Lord.

391
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,560
 And I'm trying to enjoy the sweetness of his company.

392
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,520
 And I am asking hard questions

393
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,120
 and I'm doing the hard work of answering those myself

394
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
 and not just pawning the work off on someone else.

395
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,840
 I'm trying to do all of it exactly as you're describing.

396
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,520
 And yet I feel so unstable.

397
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,180
 I feel so tossed about.

398
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,860
 I feel so insecure.

399
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,420
 I do not feel strong.

400
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,860
 I do not feel safe.

401
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,580
 This all feels like a hoax.

402
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,080
 What am I doing wrong?

403
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,100
 Nothing.

404
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,220
 You see, it's not that you've set your mind

405
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,300
 on the wrong thing.

406
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,520
 It's that you've set your mind on the right thing.

407
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,460
 And he wants you to seek him still more.

408
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,660
 Some of the sweetest moments I've had with the Lord

409
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,320
 are in those moments where I'm like,

410
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,700
 God, it's burning up around me.

411
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,500
 Like, help me, please pull me out.

412
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,600
 And yet he won't just chop her on over,

413
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,140
 drop back down, scoop me up and then lead me away.

414
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:55,660
 You know, the gospel is that he sees me in my pain

415
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,140
 and he gets into it with me.

416
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,100
 So if you're struggling,

417
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,420
 though you have set your mind on what is meaningful,

418
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,940
 take heart.

419
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,020
 He wants to take you deeper.

420
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,780
 He wants to lead you further.

421
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,540
 He wants to show you something better.

422
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,060
 He's looking at you and he's like, I know it's hard.

423
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,700
 Come on, don't give up, don't quit.

424
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
 I've not quit.

425
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,740
 I'm still here.

426
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,700
 I'm still chasing.

427
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
 I'm still pursuing.

428
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
 Come closer, keep pursuing.

429
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,380
 Don't stop now.

430
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,020
 I'm taking you someplace you never knew to ask

431
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,180
 in some place you never dared to dream.

432
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,260
 It will be better.

433
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,580
 Keep coming, keep going.

434
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
 Don't give up.

435
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,860
 And what we find is as we do,

436
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,820
 we begin to look more like Jesus,

437
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,660
 which is where Paul continues to go.

438
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,460
 And as we step into verse five,

439
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,140
 we see, he says this,

440
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,220
 "Put to death therefore what is earthly in you,

441
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,460
 sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire,

442
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,220
 and covetousness," which is idolatry.

443
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,180
 "On account of these things, the wrath of God is coming

444
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,940
 in these you too once walked when you were living in them.

445
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,300
 But now, because you have been transferred,

446
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,480
 you must put them all away.

447
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,580
 Anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene talk from your mouth.

448
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,300
 Do not lie to one another,

449
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,860
 seeing that you have put off the old self

450
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,140
 with its practices and have put on the new self,

451
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,660
 which is being renewed in the knowledge

452
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,100
 after the image of its creator.

453
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,540
 Here, there is not Greek and Jews,

454
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,500
 circumcised and uncircumcised,

455
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,760
 barbarian, Scythian, slave, free,

456
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,620
 but Christ is all and he is in all."

457
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,460
 You see, Jesus, he came to unite

458
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,180
 a diversity of people together.

459
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,600
 And he wants to bring that diversity into maturity.

460
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,300
 Now, there's a lot that we could say about these verses,

461
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,580
 but as I said at the beginning,

462
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,380
 I just want us to catch the main movements

463
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,580
 of Paul's discourse.

464
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,540
 And so what we see here is that he moves

465
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,740
 from an indicative statement to an imperative statement.

466
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,580
 Okay?

467
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,580
 He has helped us to understand our reality.

468
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,380
 He indicated our reality.

469
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,920
 You've been raised with Christ,

470
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,920
 and therefore he then articulates our activity.

471
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,320
 This is so important and not in my notes.

472
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,060
 I just, I want you to catch it,

473
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,460
 'cause this was my fear.

474
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,100
 We're gonna get into a lot of practicals tonight.

475
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,280
 And all of them tell you how to become like Jesus.

476
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,760
 But here's the thing.

477
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,460
 We talked about it last week.

478
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,940
 Your best effort, the good college try,

479
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,660
 all the grit you can muster,

480
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,220
 your own strength will never make you like Jesus.

481
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,260
 No, you are already identified in him

482
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,500
 the minute you place your faith in him.

483
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,180
 You're saved, you're secure, you are one with Christ.

484
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,380
 Your life is hidden in him.

485
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,940
 And it is from there, once the power's on,

486
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,060
 that then you can become like him.

487
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,420
 That's what all this is.

488
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,920
 You don't just employ a bunch of practical steps,

489
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,700
 strategic to-dos to arrive at greater Christlikeness.

490
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,720
 That's not how it works.

491
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,000
 You lean to the power of God and his spirit,

492
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
 and he will sanctify you.

493
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,020
 But here's what we know.

494
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,980
 What we know is that he gives us two really strong commands.

495
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,100
 He says, "Hey, I've indicated your reality.

496
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,340
 "You're saved, you're in me, you've been raised with Christ.

497
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,420
 "Now here's an articulated activity, two things.

498
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,620
 "Put to death and put away,"

499
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,460
 which are really strong commands,

500
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,900
 but they're totally appropriate.

501
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,580
 They're absolutely appropriate, why?

502
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,100
 Because if you're no longer dead,

503
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,940
 then you should put to death

504
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,340
 those things from your old way of life.

505
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,340
 And if you're now alive in Christ, if you have a new life,

506
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,440
 then you should not continue observing

507
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,700
 your old way of living.

508
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,060
 You should put it away.

509
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,660
 That's what he's getting at.

510
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,620
 Paul's point is this.

511
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,140
 You can't lead a godly life and follow deadly habits.

512
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,100
 You cannot lead a godly life and follow deadly habits

513
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,340
 because it's contradictory, right?

514
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,700
 If you have a destination that you want to go to,

515
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,140
 and you prepare to set off towards that course,

516
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,780
 and yet your car is in reverse,

517
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,300
 you don't arrive at the finish line,

518
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,900
 you arrive in a wreck, you know?

519
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,160
 You find yourself in a massive heaping mess,

520
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,740
 which is exactly what happens

521
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,880
 when we entertain the very sin

522
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,820
 that Jesus went to the cross to eradicate.

523
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,400
 We find ourselves in a wreck.

524
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,940
 We find ourselves in a mess.

525
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,780
 We find ourselves amidst a deathly circumstance.

526
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,600
 In Paul's command here, he uses the Greek word nekro.

527
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,820
 It's the root word for things like necrotic or necrosis,

528
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,680
 which means simply to render weak or to mortify something.

529
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,760
 It's interesting.

530
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,040
 When I read this initially,

531
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,000
 "Put to death therefore what is earthly within you,"

532
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,760
 it like kind of motivated me, you know?

533
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,720
 I was like, "Where's the dragon and how do I slay it?"

534
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,920
 You know, I was like, "Gonna ride off into battle

535
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,680
 "and conquer that great foe."

536
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,360
 I was ready to catch the scent and hunt it down,

537
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,000
 and yet that's not what he's describing.

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,440
 That's not at all what he's articulating.

539
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,640
 You see, this is less a battle royale against your sin,

540
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,640
 and it is instead a daily denial of self through discipline.

541
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
 That's what it means to mortify.

542
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,400
 It means to suffocate something, to smother something,

543
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,140
 to squash it out.

544
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,600
 That's how you mortify.

545
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,180
 That's the description he gives here

546
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,920
 when he says, "Put to death."

547
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,380
 John Owen, in "The Mortification of Sin,"

548
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,440
 he talks about it like this.

549
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,800
 He says, "Do you mortify?

550
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,480
 "Do you make it your daily work?

551
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,360
 "Be always at it whilst you live.

552
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,200
 "Cease not a day from this work."

553
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,400
 And here's the line,

554
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,240
 "Be killing sin or it will be killing you."

555
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,400
 Which means that if you're not fighting your sin,

556
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,580
 you're losing to it.

557
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,120
 Because sin never turns a blind eye to you.

558
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,600
 It is always watching, it's always waiting.

559
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
 The way the Bible describes it,

560
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,980
 it's like a lion roaming about

561
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,800
 looking for someone to devour.

562
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,420
 Sin is the ultimate apex predator.

563
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,140
 Like if you go and you study apex predators,

564
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,000
 which you don't need to 'cause I've done it a little bit,

565
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,100
 what you find is that apex predators

566
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,160
 have a variety of characteristics and behaviors

567
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,240
 that help them to snatch their prey,

568
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,040
 to seize the weak, to harm the defenseless.

569
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,480
 So great white sharks, they blend into their surroundings.

570
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
 They're blue from above and they're white from underneath.

571
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,320
 Crocs, they can virtually submerge their entire self.

572
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,600
 That way they can lie and wait for unsuspecting prey.

573
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,920
 Lions, they strategically, skillfully

574
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,800
 separate the weak from the rest of the herd.

575
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,480
 This is the way in which apex predators work

576
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,360
 and your sin is doing it to you.

577
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,220
 That's why we don't cozy up to it.

578
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,640
 That's why we don't make friends with it,

579
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,380
 entertain it, belittle it.

580
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,480
 We address it for what it is, because it's deadly.

581
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,860
 And it wants to kill you.

582
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,400
 And if you do not kill it first, it may in fact succeed.

583
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,440
 And while we don't have time to get into the detail

584
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,840
 of each of the vices that Paul gives here,

585
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,180
 I'll say this, he gives two different lists

586
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,280
 of five vices each.

587
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,240
 The first list are all sexual in nature.

588
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
 Sexual immorality, impurity, passion,

589
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,680
 evil desire, and covetousness.

590
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,240
 The second list he gives, they're all vengeful in nature.

591
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,760
 Anger, wrath, malice, slander,

592
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,920
 and obscene talk from your mouth.

593
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,120
 Which is fascinating, because neither the idea of sex

594
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,280
 nor the idea of vengeance is inherently immoral.

595
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,080
 God actually invented both.

596
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,500
 If you think about it, procreation was his idea.

597
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,640
 We didn't come up with that one.

598
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,840
 Sex was a gift.

599
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,060
 It's a part of his created order.

600
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,560
 And then if you think about vengeance,

601
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,360
 God will avenge any and every wrong at the end of time.

602
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,000
 This is characteristic of him.

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,760
 And what's fascinating is because we've been made

604
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,600
 into his image, it's characteristic of us.

605
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,280
 It's not surprising that sparks fly

606
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,240
 whenever you're near that special someone.

607
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,440
 You know, it's what you want.

608
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,280
 It makes sense.

609
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,600
 Sex is a good thing.

610
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,600
 And it's not abnormal that you do feel a deep sense

611
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,200
 of injustice when you see someone wrong

612
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,320
 that did nothing to deserve it.

613
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,920
 These things, they are intrinsically true of us.

614
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,680
 They're a part of the human psyche.

615
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,020
 So if they're not objectively immoral,

616
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,320
 how then do they get off the tracks?

617
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,120
 Like when do they become sinful

618
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,160
 when we're willing to hurt other people to help ourselves?

619
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,380
 That's what every single one of these vices,

620
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,360
 all 10 of them describe.

621
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,960
 They are perpetuated upon other people.

622
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,660
 Think about it.

623
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,080
 Lust is using someone else for my personal gratification

624
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,040
 and revenge is abusing someone else

625
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,820
 for my personal justification.

626
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,680
 And both the source of the sin is selfishness.

627
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,080
 It's self-seeking, which is what Paul unpacks

628
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,480
 when he writes a letter to the Romans.

629
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,600
 He says this in Romans 2, six and eight, he says,

630
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
 he, talking about God,

631
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,920
 will render to each one according to his works,

632
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,800
 to those who by patience and well-doing seek for glory

633
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,480
 and honor and immortality, he will give them eternal life.

634
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,320
 It's great.

635
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,700
 But for those who are self-seeking

636
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,440
 and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,

637
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,980
 there will be wrath and fury,

638
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,460
 which is what Paul means when he gets into verse six.

639
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,620
 He says, it's because of our sin

640
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,380
 that the wrath of God is coming.

641
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,340
 Why?

642
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,740
 Why is that the case?

643
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,740
 Because it is not God's heart to advance himself

644
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,380
 at the expense of other people.

645
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,880
 It is God's heart to advance people

646
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,340
 at the expense of himself.

647
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,300
 Let me say it again.

648
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:17,040
 Because there was the gospel,

649
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,760
 and it is deserving of rejoicing.

650
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,200
 It is not consistent with God's heart

651
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,140
 to advance himself at the expense of people.

652
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,480
 It is his heart to advance people,

653
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,960
 you and me, at the expense of himself.

654
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,920
 That is what he has done in Christ.

655
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,920
 Jesus, worthy of all glory and honor and praise.

656
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,440
 He gave up his own life.

657
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,680
 He laid himself down.

658
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,240
 He rendered himself as nothing

659
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,480
 that we might be considered something.

660
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,080
 This is what it's pointing towards.

661
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,680
 This is what Paul is saying.

662
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,520
 So if this is the case, we should do the same.

663
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,660
 Yet, why don't we?

664
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:12,780
 Because I think that we see sin as dreadful

665
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,680
 only when it's detectable.

666
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,920
 We find sin is dreadful only when it's detectable.

667
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,100
 If nobody knows, no big deal, right?

668
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,300
 No harm, no foul.

669
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,520
 That's why you delete your search history

670
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,840
 after you look at things you shouldn't,

671
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,320
 'cause you don't want it to be detected.

672
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,920
 That's why you're nice to their face

673
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,260
 despite the fact that you did

674
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,160
 or said some things behind their back,

675
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,680
 'cause you don't want it to be detectable.

676
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,940
 This is why we tell the half truth

677
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,000
 instead of the full truth,

678
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,980
 because we don't want our sin to be detectable.

679
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,480
 And yet, here's the fact of the matter.

680
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,700
 Just because nobody knows

681
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,360
 does not mean that God doesn't.

682
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,280
 God does know.

683
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,880
 He sees it all.

684
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,720
 But Kylan, what if I'm not harming anyone?

685
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,200
 What if I'm not hurting anyone?

686
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,440
 What if it's just me in my apartment, in my house,

687
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,520
 and I'm just looking at porn by myself?

688
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,220
 That's not hurting anybody.

689
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,360
 What if I'm just having one too many on my own?

690
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 What if I'm just coping to get through the day?

691
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,680
 Like, what if I'm just...

692
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,220
 Listen, you may not be hurting someone else,

693
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,240
 but you are in fact hurting someone,

694
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,640
 and that would be yourself.

695
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,560
 That's why God cares.

696
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,660
 You see, the wrath of God, it's an often mistaken idea,

697
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,140
 because what we think of when we hear the wrath of God,

698
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,440
 we think of a big, judgmental, angry God.

699
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,540
 And yet, he is a loving father.

700
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,880
 The degree to which God loves you

701
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,720
 directly correlates to the degree

702
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,380
 of the hate he has for your sin.

703
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,520
 Think about it like this.

704
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,080
 What father that is good

705
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,400
 would see their son, their daughter stolen away from them,

706
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,320
 and not with great ferocity,

707
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,560
 chase down the one that took them from them?

708
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,200
 This is what God has done.

709
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,740
 God's wrath is poured out on sin,

710
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,320
 because it took you away from him.

711
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,400
 That's why we have to level with the fact

712
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,240
 that whether we're doing it against someone else,

713
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,000
 or we're doing it to ourself, all of it is against him.

714
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,960
 And yet, the beauty of the gospel

715
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,960
 is that God has poured out his wrath on your sin

716
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,360
 in the person of Jesus Christ,

717
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,840
 that it's no longer stored up for you

718
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,480
 if you place your faith in him,

719
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,600
 which is why it's such good news

720
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,560
 that you go free and he takes the hit.

721
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,540
 You cannot lead a godly life and follow deadly habits.

722
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,800
 So what does it look like?

723
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,940
 Like, how do we actually do this?

724
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,640
 How do we actually address the sin that's in our life?

725
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,820
 You confess it, not part of it, but all of it.

726
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,660
 You fight it.

727
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,820
 You fight it in the context of community,

728
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,880
 not in isolation nor by yourself.

729
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,580
 And then once these things are done, you move on.

730
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,920
 That's the good news.

731
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,960
 You move on.

732
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,040
 There's grace.

733
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,240
 There's forgiveness.

734
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,560
 You gotta address it.

735
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,120
 You gotta put it to death.

736
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,080
 You must mortify it, smother it, suffocate it,

737
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,480
 eradicate it from your life,

738
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,820
 and then when you do, move forward.

739
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,080
 And to the things that Paul describes here at the end,

740
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,400
 in verse 12, he says this.

741
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,880
 He says, "Put on then, as God's chosen ones,

742
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,480
 "holy and beloved, compassionate hearts,

743
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,500
 "kindness, humility, meekness, patience.

744
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,680
 "Bear with one another.

745
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,600
 "And if one has a complaint against another,

746
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,840
 "forgive each other.

747
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,080
 "As the Lord has forgiven you, so you must also forgive.

748
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,880
 "And above all else, and above all these, put on love,

749
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,320
 "which binds everything together in perfect harmony,

750
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,480
 "and let the peace of Christ rule in your heart

751
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,640
 "to which you indeed were called in one body,

752
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,760
 "and be thankful."

753
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,600
 You have good reason to be.

754
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,280
 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly,

755
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,400
 teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom,

756
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,520
 singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs

757
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,280
 with thankfulness in your hearts to God.

758
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,840
 And whatever you do, in word or in deed,

759
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,740
 do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,

760
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,440
 giving thanks to God the Father through him.

761
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,280
 It says in verse 12 that we put on

762
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,800
 five different virtues of love.

763
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,160
 He gave us 10 vices that we are to put off,

764
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,260
 and now he gives us five virtues that we're to put on.

765
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,540
 The Greek for put on is literally descriptive of clothing.

766
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,720
 You take off the old and you put on the new.

767
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,440
 You've outgrown that way of life,

768
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,660
 now it's time to put on the new way of life.

769
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,540
 What's it look like?

770
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,320
 It looks like Jesus, that's what it looks like.

771
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
 You're supposed to look like he looks.

772
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
 What does he look like?

773
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,960
 In one word, as this text tells us in verse 14,

774
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,400
 it looks like love.

775
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,500
 That's what it looks like,

776
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,760
 because he lived a life clothed with love for other people.

777
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,780
 And so we should do the exact same thing.

778
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,320
 When Brooke and I first started dating,

779
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,680
 I wore a lot of flannel.

780
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,160
 In contrast, Brooke did not.

781
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,460
 She did not wear any flannel.

782
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,240
 She had no flannel whatsoever.

783
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,160
 And because I loved her,

784
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,140
 what I decided is I was going to buy her

785
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,160
 her very first flannel.

786
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,200
 So I decided to make the purchase,

787
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,240
 which guys, you can commiserate with me

788
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,580
 in the fact that buying clothes for your girl

789
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,080
 is really difficult to do.

790
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,520
 But I made the purchase,

791
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,840
 the bigger the flannel, the better, you know?

792
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,320
 And so it was an easy purchase.

793
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,480
 Went, bought the flannel, gave it to Brooke.

794
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,500
 And what do you think happened when she got it?

795
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,000
 Think she just like shoved it in the closet?

796
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,360
 Like refused to let it ever see the light of day?

797
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,800
 No.

798
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
 She wore it the very next date that we went on.

799
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,880
 Why?

800
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,840
 I know.

801
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,880
 Why did she do it?

802
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 Is it because she loved the flannel?

803
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,520
 No.

804
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,960
 I haven't seen it since.

805
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,240
 (congregation laughing)

806
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,940
 She wore it because she loved me.

807
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,920
 She wanted to look like the one who loved her.

808
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,120
 And in the same way,

809
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,720
 we should desire to look like the one who loves us.

810
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,520
 Jesus Christ has loved us with a love

811
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,640
 that is genuinely inexpressible.

812
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,400
 We do our best here every Tuesday to tell you about it.

813
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,360
 But the best manner with which you can see his love

814
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,060
 is by looking at our lives.

815
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,440
 I pray the same would be true for you.

816
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,560
 You see, Paul, to help us get an idea

817
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,760
 of what this love looks like,

818
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,040
 he gives us three verbs over the course

819
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,640
 of this section of scripture.

820
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,320
 And those verbs are to bear with one another,

821
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,760
 forgive one another, and admonish one another.

822
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,200
 All of which are extremely inconveniencing, right?

823
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,280
 They're all inconveniencing.

824
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,680
 Like just think about it.

825
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,320
 No one chooses to bear with someone else because it's easy.

826
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,840
 No, bearing with someone,

827
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,800
 that's a conscious choice to enter into suffering

828
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,160
 alongside someone you care about.

829
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,080
 Like no one chooses to forgive someone because it's easy.

830
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,440
 No, it's a conscious choice to overlook the wrong

831
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,420
 and trespass of someone that has done you dirty.

832
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,000
 No one chooses to admonish people because it's easy.

833
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,880
 But instead it's a conscious choice to brave the awkward

834
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,640
 and confront someone because you actually do care about them

835
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
 and you wanna see them better.

836
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,800
 This is what it looks like to love.

837
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,780
 You see, Paul, and our final point tells us,

838
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,920
 if you wanna look like Christ,

839
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,500
 then this is the kind of love you should have.

840
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,960
 And yet what you need to know is,

841
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,780
 although love is rarely easy, it's always worth it.

842
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,700
 Although love is rarely easy, it's often inconveniencing.

843
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
 It's always worth it.

844
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,240
 Paul begins a section by reminding us

845
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,160
 that we're God's chosen ones, holy, beloved,

846
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
 which is interesting because those three words,

847
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,680
 adjectives that he uses there, chosen, holy, beloved,

848
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,460
 those are all very descriptive of Jesus Christ himself.

849
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:22,140
 As you read about Jesus's life in the scriptures.

850
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,340
 Why is that interesting?

851
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,800
 Because if you read about us in the scriptures,

852
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,720
 we were not always identified as holy, chosen, and beloved.

853
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,480
 Instead, we were identified as the enemies of God.

854
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,840
 And yet here's what's wild.

855
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,080
 He has made you like his son

856
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,160
 because despite the fact that you're his enemy,

857
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,120
 he loved you anyways.

858
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,920
 That's what he says in Romans 5, 8.

859
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,000
 But God shows his love for us

860
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,680
 in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

861
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,680
 You see, God, he did the undeniable.

862
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,600
 He did something the likes of which

863
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,640
 we will spend the rest of our lives

864
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,680
 and all eternity trying to understand.

865
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,680
 He chose to love us when we were so very unlovable.

866
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,680
 I officiate weddings a lot.

867
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,880
 That's part of the gig.

868
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
 This is kind of what you do.

869
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,980
 You're a bunch of young singles,

870
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,120
 maybe some marrieds in the room, mostly young singles.

871
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,040
 And so I get the joy of watching two people find each other

872
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,680
 and wrap their arms up and make their way into the future.

873
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,600
 And so I stand at the altar with people.

874
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,320
 And what I hear every time I see two people

875
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,840
 come to the altar and they covenant together in marriage

876
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,800
 is I hear them make vows.

877
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,720
 They look at each other and they say things like,

878
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,480
 "For better or worse, for richer or poorer,

879
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,020
 sickness and in health, when you look like this

880
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,080
 and when you don't, I'm in."

881
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
 Doesn't matter.

882
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,680
 Here at the beginning of our marriage,

883
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,220
 before we've ever seen a day out in front of us,

884
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,400
 before we know any of the troubles or the trials that await,

885
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,800
 whether it's bright in the future or it's extremely bleak,

886
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
 right now, here in this moment, at this altar, I choose you.

887
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,940
 I want you.

888
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,400
 It doesn't matter what you do.

889
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,200
 I'm in, I choose you regardless

890
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,200
 of what you will or will not do to me, for me, or with me.

891
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,040
 That's a love that is so uncharacteristic of our world.

892
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,560
 You see, our world, we look at love

893
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,600
 and what it does is the world would say,

894
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,840
 "Love is all about compatibility."

895
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,660
 You know?

896
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,160
 Hey man, like so long as this is working for you

897
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,960
 and it's working for me and we're moving on

898
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,460
 and gaining ground, I'm in.

899
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,480
 But the minute you let me down,

900
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,360
 the minute this thing doesn't work out, I'm out.

901
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,880
 The good news of the way in which Jesus has loved us

902
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,520
 is he has not chosen to love us because we're compatible.

903
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,480
 There's no more incompatible couple in all of history

904
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,140
 than Christ and his church.

905
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,160
 No, he loves us because he chooses to,

906
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,480
 because he's committed to us.

907
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,720
 Love is rarely easy.

908
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,320
 And so is it equally difficult to love an enemy.

909
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,880
 And yet he wanted you, he wanted me.

910
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,560
 So he chose us in a difficult moment,

911
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,720
 in a moment that stretched his arms out

912
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,900
 upon Calvary's cross, because it was worth it to him.

913
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,440
 And so we should love each other like this.

914
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,440
 This is characteristic for those that live in Christ.

915
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,680
 They choose to love one another.

916
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
 How do I know that?

917
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,600
 Because it's characteristic of Christ himself.

918
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,000
 He has chosen to love us.

919
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 You see, before we ever thought to set our minds

920
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 on things above, Christ Jesus set his mind on us here below.

921
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,080
 And he made his way close to us.

922
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,600
 Before you and I could ever take off our shame,

923
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,600
 Christ took off his glory by hanging himself up

924
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,840
 for all to see, bearing the full consequence

925
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,780
 of what we in our sinfulness rightly deserved.

926
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:46,740
 And before we could ever put on his righteousness,

927
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,880
 he voluntarily put on our sin.

928
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,140
 (gentle music)

929
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,840
 What are you setting your mind on?

930
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,680
 Whatever it is, it does not compare to him.

931
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,020
 What clothes or garments, old way of life

932
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,120
 are you still wearing tonight that he's looking at you

933
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,280
 and he's saying, "Lay it down, take it off."

934
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,000
 What would love look like in your life to put it on?

935
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,640
 This is the call before us here tonight, porch,

936
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,640
 because this is the call to all that would claim Christ.

937
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,640
 Let me pray for us.

938
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,060
 (gentle music)

939
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,900
 (water trickling)

940
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,480
 (gentle music)

941
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,320
 (water trickling)

942
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,940
 Father, when I think about your son

943
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:25,880
 and all God that he would give to get us,

944
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,620
 I cannot think of anything, God,

945
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:35,180
 that I would not give to get him in return.

946
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:42,260
 It is so mind-blowing, wild to consider

947
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:51,140
 that you, God, a God that is real,

948
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,140
 a God that is alive, a God that is incomprehensible,

949
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:05,660
 a greater God than we could dare to dream,

950
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,660
 that a God like that would look upon a people like us,

951
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:15,860
 like us, riddled in our sin, covered in our shame,

952
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:21,580
 walking around with a stain the likes

953
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,980
 of which we can never clean,

954
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,980
 and you, God, would say, "I want you."

955
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,820
 That doesn't make any sense.

956
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,540
 I don't understand it, God.

957
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,980
 And yet that is what you have declared

958
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,100
 across the corridors of time in your son,

959
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,020
 is you have seen us when we were a long way off,

960
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,300
 lost in our sin, and you said, "I'm coming for you.

961
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,940
 I'll chase you down.

962
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,460
 I'll move heaven and earth

963
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,220
 and across whatever barrier there is just to get to you."

964
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,500
 What God would we not give up to get that?

965
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,380
 What God would we not lay down to have that?

966
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,820
 (gentle music)

967
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,540
 And God, I know like here tonight,

968
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,060
 there are people in this room that you're looking upon

969
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,420
 with a full knowledge, God, of their sin.

970
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,100
 And your response isn't anger.

971
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,260
 It's not disappointment.

972
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,820
 It's not frustration.

973
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:27,500
 It's, "Little girl, my precious boy,

974
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,260
 what are you doing here?

975
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,620
 How did you arrive at this place?

976
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,340
 This deserves to be dealt with,

977
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,020
 and I will deal with it.

978
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,820
 But you come with me,

979
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,060
 and we will see the end of it together."

980
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,660
 Friends, some of you here tonight,

981
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,220
 we sing this at the beginning of the evening.

982
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,380
 This is a moment of surrender.

983
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,460
 This is a fresh start.

984
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,420
 It's a chance to break the script of your regular life

985
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,860
 and say, "God, I don't wanna go this way anymore.

986
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,180
 I don't wanna set my mind on the things of this world.

987
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,420
 I wanna set it on you.

988
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,820
 I don't wanna entertain these sins, God,

989
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,340
 which you went to the cross to condemn.

990
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,860
 Instead, I wanna trust in you."

991
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,260
 Others of us, we're here,

992
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,460
 and we're not ready to be forgiven.

993
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,380
 And man, we've set our mind on the meaningful,

994
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,860
 and we're actively putting to death

995
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,980
 these things in our life

996
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,980
 which are not characteristic of Christ.

997
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,900
 Who then is it that God is calling you,

998
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,620
 compelling you to love,

999
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:48,660
 to admonish, to forgive, to bear with alongside?

1000
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,740
 What does that look like in your life?

1001
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,820
 God is working here in this space.

1002
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,900
 He has brought you here this evening

1003
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,460
 individually for you to take a step with.

1004
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,780
 What's that step look like?

1005
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,260
 God, we trust you,

1006
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:13,940
 and we step towards you that we might go further,

1007
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,300
 we might ascend higher,

1008
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,420
 we might delve deeper than we've ever gone on our own.

1009
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,620
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

1010
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:30,620
