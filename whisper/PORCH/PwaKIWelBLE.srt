1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,040
 - All right, let's do it, let's do it.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,960
 What's up?

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,040
 Our friends tuning in in Porch Live, Tulsa,

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,040
 Scottsdale, Boise, Idaho, my friends in Dallas, what's up?

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,220
 We are back having Awaken guest speakers,

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,240
 all the things, we're back kicking off our fourth night

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,880
 of our dating series, Dateable.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,360
 And I know we had some people upset after, is he dateable?

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,400
 We're like, yeah, next week, is she dateable?

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,040
 And then next week didn't come,

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,540
 and the next week didn't come.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,280
 People were knocking on my DMs.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,640
 I had a mom in my DMs like, you said next week,

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,800
 is she dateable?

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,840
 And I'm like, you're married.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,520
 And then I'm like, she's like my daughter.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,560
 I was gonna say it to my daughter.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,320
 And I was like, well, to that mom,

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,800
 if you're listening tonight, we're here.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,860
 We're here now.

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,560
 And just so excited.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,600
 And like I said, if you didn't join us,

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,920
 basically what we did a few weeks ago

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,580
 is got to just walk through three questions

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,320
 that girls should be asking,

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,660
 and guys should be even asking themselves concerning,

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,880
 hey, is this guy that I potentially will be dating,

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,840
 is he dateable?

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,280
 According to God's standards, not culture,

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,320
 what I want, but what God wants.

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,400
 And tonight, this one is for the boys.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,560
 Okay, Tuesdays tonight are for the boys.

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,140
 If you're a guy in the house and you're ready,

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,000
 let me hear you say, yeah.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,120
 - Yeah.

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,760
 - Oh, I love it, manpower.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
 But before I get to that,

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,860
 I would like to introduce you guys

40
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,920
 to a friend of mine and his wife.

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
 This is Ryan and Becca.

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,100
 Ryan and Becca Michael.

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,700
 And these two individuals are really special,

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,640
 have been through a lot this year.

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,800
 And I'll tell you a little bit about it.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,960
 So I'm a friend of Ryan's and come February,

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,120
 he got the news that his kidney was failing.

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,820
 At just the age of 24, newly married, his kidneys failing.

49
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,080
 And it just rapidly started declining.

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,560
 His health started declining.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
 And I know this is like a downer to start on,

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
 but has a hopeful ending.

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,360
 So we get this news and all of the friends around,

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
 we prayed about it and we're like,

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,320
 hey, let's see if we could be a live donor.

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,520
 And so all of us apply all these different things.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,660
 And when I got the application,

58
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,860
 I had no idea the work that went into

59
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,160
 potentially being a live donor.

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,040
 And it makes sense.

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,780
 Like, if you think about it, like if you are selected,

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,760
 they're going to cut you open,

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,040
 take out a major organ and give it to someone.

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,080
 That's a big deal.

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,480
 And so because it's a big deal,

66
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,980
 they ask a lot of questions.

67
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,560
 There's so much involved in the testing process

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,160
 to see if you're a match.

69
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,460
 Because if you think about it, how pointless would it be?

70
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,800
 How much unnecessary pain would you have to go through

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,240
 if whenever you hear, hey,

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
 you got my friend's kidneys failing,

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
 you're just like, take mine.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,840
 Just for them to open it up, try to give it to Ryan

75
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,700
 and to see that it wasn't a match.

76
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,660
 Like it would be pointless.

77
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,060
 It would be for nothing.

78
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,360
 And so they ask all of these really strategic questions.

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,940
 And out of the process, the longest part by far

80
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,780
 is what's called the consultation.

81
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,740
 Where if you go further and further in your blood,

82
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,860
 your blood types the same, all these different things,

83
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,020
 you sit down with all these medical professionals

84
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,700
 and they just drill you with questions,

85
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,900
 questions, questions, medical history,

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,060
 your family's medical history,

87
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,860
 your family's family's medical history,

88
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,260
 your all these different intimate details of your life.

89
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,140
 They even check your mental state,

90
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,420
 all these different things.

91
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,260
 Why?

92
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,060
 All of the answers through process of elimination,

93
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,540
 through other cases,

94
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,620
 what these professionals are doing is determining

95
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,500
 based off of what this person says,

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,780
 will Ryan's body accept this kidney?

97
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,660
 Will they be a match?

98
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,500
 Why?

99
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,320
 Because like I said,

100
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,420
 there are major implications of this surgery

101
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,300
 and we want to guarantee that these two people

102
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,300
 are the right match.

103
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,100
 So we want to make sure we ask the right questions.

104
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,460
 I start there because I think so many of us meet a person

105
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,340
 because they're good looking, attractive,

106
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,980
 and make us feel butterflies inside.

107
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,460
 We don't ask any questions.

108
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,100
 We jump right into the deep end.

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,140
 We open up ourself, give them our heart, all for what?

110
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,060
 Rejection,

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,900
 hurt,

112
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,700
 unnecessary pain that we still are experiencing

113
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,600
 the ramifications of the choice that we made

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,340
 to not make sure that, hey,

115
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,100
 am I asking the right questions?

116
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,300
 Am I doing the right pre-work

117
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,140
 before I jump into a relationship with this person?

118
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,980
 Am I asking the right questions,

119
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,040
 not according to my way,

120
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,940
 but to what God would have for me in a relationship?

121
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,420
 We don't do the hard work to make sure

122
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,420
 that this relationship would work

123
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,540
 in the way that God would want it.

124
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,600
 And the result is, is we jump in too soon.

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
 And because of that, heartbreak and pain.

126
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,940
 And so fellas tonight,

127
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,580
 and ladies, I hope you are taking notes

128
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,080
 and you're listening just as well,

129
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,020
 because tonight we're gonna just go through again,

130
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,020
 three questions that I think that God would have us ask

131
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,360
 before we jump into a relationship,

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,500
 before we even get into an exclusive dating relationship,

133
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,100
 before pursuing her, we ask these questions.

134
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,020
 Hey, is she dateable?

135
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,860
 Is she a match?

136
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,980
 Is this what God would want for me?

137
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,980
 Not based on what I see or I feel,

138
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,820
 but according to his truth and his design.

139
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,460
 So you're ready to do it?

140
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,300
 Here we go.

141
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,700
 First question a guy should ask is,

142
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,500
 who currently has her heart?

143
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 Who currently as a single individual has her heart?

144
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,020
 Before giving her your heart,

145
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,860
 or before asking her to open up herself

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,140
 and to begin giving her heart to you,

147
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,220
 you should be able to answer right now as an individual,

148
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,620
 as an independent woman, who has her heart?

149
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,380
 What does she love?

150
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,920
 Who does she love?

151
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,260
 Does culture have her heart?

152
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,260
 Does any guy that will give her attention have her heart?

153
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,660
 Does her ex still have her heart?

154
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,360
 Does social media, gratification,

155
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,580
 people's perceptions of her,

156
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,940
 what has her heart?

157
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,740
 And I think we come to church

158
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,340
 and I'm gonna give you the answer.

159
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,740
 Hey, her first love,

160
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,340
 the who behind who should have her heart

161
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,940
 as a single individual is Jesus Christ.

162
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,300
 And I think we hear that and we're like, yeah, of course,

163
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,540
 like I want her to be a Christian.

164
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,180
 I want her to love God.

165
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,460
 But really you can tell if a person is about it or not.

166
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,760
 Real recognize real, all right?

167
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,220
 And you can tell if Jesus truly has her heart.

168
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,620
 And I don't mean that he's just a part of her life,

169
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,020
 but he's the point of her life.

170
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,980
 Jesus is her everything.

171
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,000
 Jesus gets all of her attention,

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,400
 all of her affections, all of her devotion.

173
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,580
 She pretty much doesn't even notice you noticing her

174
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,680
 because she's fixated on what Jesus has for her, not on you.

175
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,700
 Because he is her love.

176
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,720
 He has her heart in such a way

177
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,000
 that should gravitate your heart towards her.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,980
 Paul says this, we read this all the time

179
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,900
 talking about the season of singleness,

180
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,740
 which by the way,

181
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,220
 I hope that you're scoping out the women who are single.

182
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,660
 As single people,

183
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,420
 this is what Paul says should be true of them.

184
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,780
 First Corinthians 7.25.

185
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,800
 I am saying all of this, he says all these things,

186
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,460
 for your own good, not to restrict you.

187
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,820
 Like singleness isn't a restriction,

188
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,560
 but that you may live in a right way.

189
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
 What's the right way?

190
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,840
 In undivided devotion to the Lord.

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,000
 So when you ask yourself, hey, who has her heart?

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,440
 Another way, Paul's way of saying that is,

193
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,760
 does Jesus have her undivided devotion?

194
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,020
 Has she fully surrendered her life to him?

195
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,520
 (audience laughing)

196
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,240
 And I think that so many of us were like,

197
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,180
 yeah, well, everyone, especially in Texas,

198
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,040
 like calls himself a Christian.

199
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
 Like, how can you know?

200
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,620
 And I just wanna talk about a little bit

201
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,780
 of what it looks like to know

202
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,120
 if a girl has given her heart fully to Jesus,

203
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,840
 not just with her mouth, but with her life.

204
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,520
 So how can you tell if Jesus has her heart?

205
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,220
 Well, how do you know if anything has anyone's heart?

206
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,980
 It's what they kind of obsess over.

207
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,880
 It's what they spend all their time talking about.

208
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,040
 It's what they spend all their time doing.

209
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,820
 As you were writing, I was thinking about,

210
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,440
 there's these two guys that lead here, they're awesome.

211
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,120
 But every time I talk to them, here is a recent,

212
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,480
 I know the same topics are gonna come up, Bitcoin.

213
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,560
 They're gonna talk about Bitcoin every single time.

214
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,640
 Or is it like Dogecoin?

215
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
 Is that what it is?

216
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,760
 Is that right?

217
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
 Some of you, okay, yeah.

218
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
 Dogecoin, I don't know.

219
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
 Yeah, but they're gonna talk about it.

220
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,360
 And I'm gonna sit here and be like,

221
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,120
 yeah, yeah, yeah, I should totally invest.

222
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,960
 You're right.

223
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
 I have no idea what they're talking about.

224
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,440
 Some cryptocurrency in the air that we all,

225
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,880
 like the world's going down and we should all invest.

226
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,560
 But the reason why is because they're investing

227
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,960
 in what they're obsessing over.

228
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,120
 And so many of us, we talk about and participate

229
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,520
 and enjoy and delight in the things that have our heart.

230
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,760
 And so does this girl, and by the way,

231
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,560
 those guys, they talk about Jesus all the time too.

232
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,400
 Yeah, he's, you know, they love Jesus.

233
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,320
 But so many times, like we talk about,

234
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,400
 we meet these people that they're all just talk,

235
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,440
 but you look at their life and there's nothing

236
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
 that reflects an actual change.

237
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,400
 The Bible says in Matthew chapter seven,

238
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,180
 that you will recognize a tree by its fruits.

239
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,560
 Like you'll recognize a tree by its fruits.

240
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,000
 That a lot of time, the spiritual walk,

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
 a life with Christ looks like,

242
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,160
 it uses like this illustration of like gardening

243
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,720
 or trees and roots.

244
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,600
 And once someone is rooted in an abiding relationship

245
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 with Jesus, they water it, they do it in proper soil

246
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,480
 and out produces so much fruit in their life

247
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,620
 that their old life dies and goes away

248
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,040
 and a new life with Christ comes.

249
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,280
 And there's so much fruit.

250
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,800
 What does fruit, what do I mean by spiritual fruit?

251
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,920
 What does that look like?

252
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
 Galatians five, verse 22 says,

253
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,320
 "The fruit of the spirit or the fruit of a person

254
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,480
 who's given Jesus their heart are these things,

255
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,480
 love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

256
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,040
 faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."

257
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,040
 When you look at this woman, what marks her life?

258
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,200
 What indicates what gets her attention and her affections?

259
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,500
 Do these things pour out of her?

260
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,360
 Like if you were to try to hit her up,

261
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,040
 is she probably busy because she's too busy being the church?

262
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,560
 She's too busy making disciples and meeting with girls.

263
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,320
 Like is she the type of girl that whenever vacations

264
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,520
 come around and she finally gets time off of work,

265
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,040
 she goes on mission trips because she wants to go and serve

266
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,760
 and talk about what Jesus has done in her life.

267
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,040
 Is she the type of girl that every time you get around her,

268
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,180
 you experience this just like, she's different.

269
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,480
 She's different.

270
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,500
 There's this calming peace to her.

271
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,380
 There's this joy about her in the midst

272
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,420
 of really hard circumstances.

273
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,620
 There's this story to her.

274
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,680
 There's this thing about her that doesn't look like

275
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,240
 the girls that you met out at the bar.

276
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,880
 Doesn't look like the girls that are constantly

277
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,080
 blowing you up on Instagram.

278
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,040
 She's steady.

279
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
 She's certain.

280
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,340
 She's confident.

281
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,760
 That looks like a woman whose heart has been given to Jesus.

282
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,860
 And I think a lot of times the reason why this is actually

283
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,620
 hard for us men, I'm gonna lean in just a little bit,

284
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,540
 a little pressure point on us men right here.

285
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,540
 I think why we actually don't want a girl who has given her

286
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,100
 undivided attention to Jesus is because that means

287
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,740
 that if she's giving him her everything,

288
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,660
 we only get some of her and we want it reversed.

289
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,520
 We want her to give us everything we want

290
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,560
 and to give some of herself to Jesus.

291
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,600
 And there's this contradiction that sure,

292
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,080
 you want a girl that when you bring her home to mom and dad

293
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,200
 who forced you to go to church growing up,

294
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,640
 she can talk the talk and say, yeah, I'm a Christian.

295
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,720
 But if she actually starts living Christ-like,

296
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,880
 that contradicts what you want out of the relationship.

297
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,200
 Because if she's actually all in with Jesus,

298
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,160
 maybe she doesn't wanna sleep with you.

299
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
 If she's actually all in with Jesus,

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,420
 maybe she does want to go to church

301
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,720
 and want you to serve in the church.

302
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,180
 If she's all in with Jesus,

303
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,740
 maybe she actually is gonna demand the respect

304
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,740
 that you lead her, that you serve her, that you listen,

305
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,680
 that you practice the things in God's word.

306
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,260
 Maybe if you find a girl who's actually all in with Jesus,

307
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,220
 that means that you have to be as well.

308
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,180
 And so, I just, you know,

309
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,000
 I'm just saying, make sure

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,820
 that when you are going out to these women

311
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,900
 and you're looking across going, man, who is dateable?

312
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,740
 Who's about it?

313
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,580
 You're finding a woman

314
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,760
 who doesn't just call herself a Christian,

315
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,060
 but is living Christ-like

316
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,080
 because she has given her heart to Jesus.

317
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,060
 She is running the race.

318
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,100
 She is all out for the Lord.

319
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,660
 Next question we ask, if she's dateable,

320
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,920
 what dictates her value?

321
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,860
 What dictates her value?

322
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,020
 Well, first off, we need to answer

323
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,740
 just what dictates anyone's value.

324
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,660
 Like, where does value come from?

325
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,220
 Where do we get our value?

326
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,380
 And the reality is, the thing about value is,

327
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,780
 what determines something's value is who created it,

328
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,780
 or the inventor, the creator of that thing,

329
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,180
 and what we're willing to pay for it.

330
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,340
 Over here, I thought talking about is she dateable,

331
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,260
 I'd bring up the Louis Vuitton.

332
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,900
 So, when talking about LV,

333
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,900
 I found out from the girls on our team

334
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,740
 that pretty much everyone's got fake Louis Vuittons.

335
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,340
 That came to my surprise, and I was like, wait, what?

336
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,080
 You're a bunch of like, fakers?

337
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,060
 I thought y'all had it like that.

338
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,060
 And so, one of these is fake.

339
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
 Okay?

340
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,940
 Let's call the big girl back here, number one.

341
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,180
 (audience laughing)

342
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,420
 Little shoddy, number two.

343
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,740
 (audience laughing)

344
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,540
 And the princess with the little pink, number three, okay?

345
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,980
 So, big mama, the baddie, and the shoddy.

346
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,380
 Okay, here we go, whatever.

347
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
 Number one, number two, number three.

348
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,020
 Raise your hand on which one's fake.

349
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,180
 Here we go, is number one fake?

350
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,020
 Raise your hand.

351
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,020
 Some of you girls are like, trust me, I know,

352
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,860
 there's a difference.

353
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,180
 (audience laughing)

354
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,380
 You're like, the durability,

355
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,660
 especially in the rainy season, like, quality, quality.

356
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,140
 Okay, number two.

357
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,100
 Okay, number three.

358
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,740
 Y'all thought it was number three

359
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,460
 'cause of this strap right here, isn't it?

360
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,700
 That's exactly why.

361
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,380
 I'm gonna be honest, I don't even know, I forgot.

362
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,220
 (audience laughing)

363
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,220
 But, the point is,

364
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,580
 (audience laughing)

365
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,580
 the point, that is kind of the point, okay?

366
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:20,260
 All these bags look the same, I don't care who you are.

367
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,420
 You post a picture in one of these,

368
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,300
 and I'm like, she's got it, she's bougie.

369
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,300
 And so, you know who wouldn't agree with me?

370
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,380
 There's a girl who owns all three of those bags.

371
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,760
 And she wouldn't agree with me.

372
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,780
 She'd be like, those are not all the same.

373
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,620
 Why?

374
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
 One was made by a guy in a garage,

375
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,740
 the other two were made by Louis.

376
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,940
 And, because Louis Vuitton made those bags,

377
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,380
 they're different.

378
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,060
 Also, the reason why I did not agree

379
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,700
 is 'cause for one, I paid, what, like $80, I guess, maybe?

380
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,180
 And the other two, I paid $1,800.

381
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,380
 She, I don't know actually what the cost is.

382
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,580
 I just, I Googled and it was expensive, it was way too much.

383
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,180
 And yeah, Jenna, if you're watching, don't get any ideas.

384
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:10,180
 And so, I, the thing is, is she would say,

385
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,240
 no, no, two of those are of extreme more value

386
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,640
 because of who made it and what I paid for it.

387
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,160
 And when we're talking about a woman understanding

388
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,260
 her value, she needs to understand who created her

389
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,800
 and what he paid for her.

390
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,740
 Who created her?

391
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,360
 - God. - Was God, that's right.

392
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,860
 God, every week, I can count on this guy, okay?

393
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,120
 God, it's that kid in Sunday school.

394
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,620
 Jesus, every single time.

395
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,660
 (congregation laughing)

396
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,660
 God crafted and created woman with purpose,

397
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,040
 with a mission, with his heart, with a unique design.

398
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,180
 And I thank God that he created women.

399
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,860
 But what's so amazing about that

400
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,460
 is because the God of the universe is your creator,

401
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,180
 that means that you have more value

402
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,900
 than you could ever comprehend.

403
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,980
 And not only did he create you,

404
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,200
 but he is so good that he created you distinctly

405
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,460
 in his image.

406
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,480
 Genesis 1, 27 says,

407
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,140
 "So God created man in his own image.

408
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,140
 In the image of God, he created him.

409
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,140
 Male and female, he created them."

410
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,400
 You are made in the image of God

411
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,960
 and the purpose of your life is to bear his image,

412
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,440
 to represent his image, that when you live,

413
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,820
 you're not living for yourself.

414
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,820
 You're living as a representative of the King of kings

415
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,220
 and the Lord of lords who is in love with you,

416
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,560
 who is obsessed with you, has given you so much purpose

417
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,420
 and that's where your value comes from.

418
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,780
 You're not just made up by random chance.

419
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,420
 You're not just here for some watered down version of life.

420
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,980
 You are a daughter of the King of kings

421
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,340
 and men, you want a princess.

422
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,740
 You want someone who sees themself as such.

423
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,620
 Because then when she understands her value,

424
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,220
 when she understands what she was put on earth to do,

425
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,260
 there is a confidence and an assurance about her

426
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,620
 that will change your life.

427
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,980
 That's why you shouldn't settle for anything less

428
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,880
 than a woman who understands who her father is,

429
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,700
 what she was made for,

430
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,780
 a woman who isn't obsessed with her own image,

431
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,140
 but being an image bearer,

432
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,220
 a woman who seeks to serve that God who created her.

433
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,140
 What's even more crazy is he did not stop

434
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,060
 at simply making man and woman in his image,

435
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:37,340
 but he paid an immense price to be with them forever.

436
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,300
 And apart from anything else, forget the dating crap,

437
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,060
 forget everything else, is she, is he, I don't care.

438
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,680
 What I want you to know is that God loved you so much

439
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,060
 that he saw the sin in your world

440
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,340
 and that while you were a sinner,

441
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,800
 he sent his son to pay the price

442
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
 that you and I could never pay.

443
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,300
 That our sin was gonna build up a more and more debt

444
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,700
 that would keep us further and further away from God.

445
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,140
 And God wanted to be with you so bad that he said,

446
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,780
 "Take my one and only son."

447
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,140
 This is more worth than a bag.

448
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,820
 This is more worth than a car or a house

449
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,320
 or whatever you could buy in this world.

450
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,460
 This was his one and only son who came down to earth

451
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,340
 and God saw you as worth it for him to die on a cross

452
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,740
 for you.

453
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,700
 He bore stripes on his back.

454
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,780
 Bible says, "By his wounds, we are healed."

455
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,620
 First Corinthians 6 20 says that you were bought

456
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,180
 with a price, which was the blood of Jesus

457
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,460
 that was shed on the cross for you.

458
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,540
 And he died and they buried him.

459
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
 Three days later, he rose again,

460
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
 now claiming victory over sin

461
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,380
 and so that you and I could be with God, our creator,

462
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,220
 forever and in light of that, it changes everything.

463
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,260
 It changes everything about our past, present and future.

464
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,500
 And no matter what you've done,

465
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,540
 if you do not have that relationship,

466
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,860
 if you have never understood the value

467
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,920
 that you are worth, the son of God,

468
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,860
 coming down and dying for you,

469
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,300
 you should not worry about any other relationship.

470
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,020
 You should stop looking for a man,

471
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,540
 men, you should stop looking for women.

472
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,940
 You should look at Jesus

473
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,740
 and you should do everything you can

474
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,620
 to establish that firm relationship

475
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,220
 and experience the abundant life that comes from it.

476
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,700
 No other relationship will meet and satisfy the longing

477
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,220
 and the needs of your soul like he can.

478
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,660
 And if you keep asking the question,

479
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,820
 is she dateable, is he dateable, is this, is that,

480
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,100
 and you're missing Jesus, nothing will work.

481
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,820
 Jesus is everything.

482
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,940
 He is the glue.

483
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,460
 He is the answer to the equation that everyone's asking.

484
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,780
 It's all about Jesus.

485
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,220
 Jesus came down to establish a relationship with you

486
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,160
 so that you could be in relationship with other people,

487
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,440
 but without him, impossible.

488
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,660
 So get that one right.

489
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,900
 And men, do not settle.

490
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,740
 You make sure you care for her enough to say,

491
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,300
 "Hey, I'm not gonna get into this with you.

492
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,940
 "I'm not gonna, there's nothing more important

493
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,900
 "about this relationship than a relationship with God."

494
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,420
 And point her to where her value comes from,

495
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,980
 her creator and what he was willing to pay,

496
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,000
 the blood of his son.

497
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,140
 And if she knows that,

498
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,060
 you've got yourself a woman that is dateable.

499
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,300
 But the reality is, is I think a lot of people,

500
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,120
 a lot of ladies, they like know in their minds

501
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,460
 that through the blood of Jesus, they're set free,

502
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,860
 but they don't live like it.

503
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,620
 They live so bound, so pent up, so afraid,

504
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,620
 so idol-driven by fear of man or perception of others

505
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:03,660
 or need for control, perfectionism, an image-based reality.

506
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:08,780
 You wanna find someone who understands the power

507
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,380
 of the blood of Jesus, and they live like it's true,

508
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,780
 not just with their words, but with their life.

509
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,660
 'Cause the reality is,

510
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,100
 there are a lot of things that the world tells us

511
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,700
 makes someone valuable other than Jesus.

512
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,460
 Like Jesus isn't like the ultimate,

513
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,900
 like here's where your worth is found.

514
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,140
 And so to understand where value is,

515
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,800
 you have to also understand where it is not.

516
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,380
 And I'm gonna specifically talk about,

517
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,820
 hey, I think these are two areas where women

518
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,540
 look to for value, but you're never gonna find it.

519
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,980
 And men, if they're searching for value in these things,

520
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,700
 she is not dateable.

521
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,940
 The first one, value is not found in looks.

522
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,180
 Value is not found in the outward.

523
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,820
 That's all in scripture.

524
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,420
 Value is not found in what other people think about you

525
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,900
 or what you think about yourself.

526
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,780
 And at a time where body celebration is so praised

527
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,180
 and so clapped for,

528
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,600
 why is everyone so anxious and depressed?

529
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,100
 Why are they constantly looking at themselves in the mirror,

530
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,180
 wondering if they're enough?

531
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,300
 If it's worth celebrating,

532
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
 why internally am I not celebrating?

533
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,660
 Why am I still chasing, still striving for that affirmation?

534
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,580
 Because that's not where true value is found.

535
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,900
 First Peter three, verse three says this,

536
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,220
 "Do not let your adorning be external."

537
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,660
 So do not let the reason why people praise you

538
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,300
 or adore you be from anything on the outward.

539
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,400
 The braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry

540
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,420
 or the clothing you wear.

541
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,300
 "But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart

542
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,060
 with the imperishable."

543
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,960
 It means it will not fade.

544
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,900
 "The imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit."

545
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,980
 Now, for some of you strong women,

546
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,700
 I'm gonna address that, just give me a minute.

547
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,660
 They're like, what do you mean quiet?

548
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,540
 "Which in God's sight is very precious.

549
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,420
 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God

550
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,460
 used to adorn themselves."

551
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,080
 Here's what he means by quiet and gentle,

552
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,980
 just to get this really quick.

553
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,460
 It does not mean that women need to shut up and sit down.

554
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,840
 It does not mean that women are here to cook and clean

555
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,380
 and take care of the kids.

556
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,600
 It does not mean that, okay?

557
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,880
 However, what it does mean is when it says a woman

558
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,440
 who is quiet and gentle, this actually word,

559
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,300
 it translates to tranquil,

560
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,460
 which also translates to a peaceful spirit.

561
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,220
 This same word was used to describe Jesus actually,

562
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,500
 which also tells me that this isn't gender specific,

563
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,120
 that this is a word used,

564
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,500
 this is a word used to describe the image bearer of Jesus,

565
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,200
 you and I, someone that is marked by peace.

566
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,780
 When you see them, you're not feeling like, oh my gosh,

567
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,260
 someone that's like constantly nagging,

568
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,900
 complaining, gossiping, well this, well that,

569
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,440
 and always stressed out, but simply composed and peaceful,

570
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,700
 because they know Jesus, the author of peace,

571
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
 the prince of peace.

572
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,060
 That's what this is saying.

573
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,780
 But before we get to that, what it is not,

574
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,820
 value is not found in the external.

575
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,980
 And fellas, you need to know,

576
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,460
 and you need to be able to answer this question,

577
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,300
 is she holy or is she just hot?

578
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,140
 Okay?

579
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,980
 Is she holy or is she just hot?

580
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,180
 Because I think a lot of times,

581
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,800
 attraction can be like drunk goggles

582
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,860
 that do not give us clear vision into the heart of a woman.

583
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,840
 The Bible says in Proverbs that charm is deceitful

584
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,500
 and beauty is fleeting,

585
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,740
 but a woman who fears the Lord is worthy of praise.

586
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,660
 Charm is deceitful, beauty is fleeting.

587
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,020
 She might be smooth with her words,

588
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,420
 they might come off her lips like honeycomb.

589
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
 She might be able to whisper

590
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,340
 and do all these weird seductive things

591
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,900
 and make you feel some type of way,

592
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,300
 but what we're seeing here is none of that

593
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,940
 makes a girl dateable.

594
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,020
 None of that is what brings a girl value.

595
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,740
 And if you wanna know what a girl thinks

596
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,420
 about her outward appearance, go to her Instagram.

597
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,180
 Go to her Instagram.

598
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,060
 Her Instagram will tell you really quick

599
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,140
 if she idolizes her outward appearance.

600
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,600
 And I wanna address something.

601
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,220
 There's this thing I'm seeing

602
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,500
 leaking into Christian culture that I just,

603
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,160
 I haven't heard anyone talk about it.

604
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,860
 I'm gonna do it at the risk of,

605
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,060
 I don't know, tomatoes getting thrown at me.

606
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:51,420
 There are girls that I go on Instagram,

607
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,020
 friends, that post pictures like this.

608
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,240
 (congregation laughing)

609
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,940
 Okay, the camera's over there.

610
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,020
 They're facing over here,

611
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,140
 and I heard apparently you're supposed to

612
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,380
 go on your toes or something,

613
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,800
 and like the angle and everything.

614
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,620
 And the reality is there's a sunset over here

615
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,620
 that they're not even looking at,

616
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,780
 and the caption says, "Love God's creation."

617
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,780
 And all my brothers in Christ are like,

618
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,580
 "I love God's creation too."

619
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,820
 They're not looking at the sun,

620
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,980
 they're looking at the moon.

621
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,820
 And so,

622
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,160
 (congregation laughing)

623
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,800
 but do you know what I do?

624
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,620
 They get three strikes, all right?

625
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,780
 And then they get unfollowed.

626
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,620
 Wanna know why?

627
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:55,260
 What do you want me to look at?

628
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,300
 No, I'm being for real.

629
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,660
 Ask yourself that.

630
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,220
 What do you want us to look at?

631
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,060
 (congregation laughing)

632
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:08,480
 Like, there's no other answer than the back of you.

633
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,060
 And you come to the porch time and time again,

634
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,340
 and I hear you celebrating.

635
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,520
 It's not about physical attraction.

636
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,720
 Look at the heart.

637
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,100
 But I look at your Instagram,

638
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,260
 and there's just this, it doesn't match up.

639
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,660
 I see your skin.

640
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,320
 I see things that as just your brother in Christ,

641
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,660
 I'm telling you what you post tells me about what you value

642
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,460
 and what you think your value comes from.

643
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,700
 It also tells me how much you value your brothers in Christ

644
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,460
 who are trying to live for Jesus.

645
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,660
 It matters.

646
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,020
 How you post matters.

647
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,900
 What you wear matters.

648
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,220
 Why does it matter?

649
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,320
 Because it's feeding something.

650
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
 It's feeding a false sense of where value

651
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,580
 and self-worth lies.

652
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:09,000
 And I know, I know the reason why you do it

653
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,660
 is because sadly, a lot of guys in this room

654
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,920
 and girls like it.

655
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,880
 And that tells you, oh, look, I do this,

656
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,240
 I get attention, I get affirmation.

657
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,600
 And it, for a moment, fix your loneliness.

658
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,440
 For a moment, it allows you to forget about your singleness

659
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,820
 and the endorphins released when that post comes

660
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,540
 and all those girls saying yes, queen

661
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,480
 with those clapping emojis.

662
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,000
 And they're saying all these different things,

663
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,240
 it makes you feel good.

664
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,340
 But if you treat yourself like bait and you dangle it up,

665
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,400
 the sharks will bite.

666
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,840
 And you don't want sharks.

667
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,320
 That's not the kind of men you want.

668
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,020
 But it's what you're communicating with what you post.

669
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,520
 So I'll get off my soapbox.

670
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,120
 But first Peter here is saying the external

671
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,380
 is not what makes a woman valuable.

672
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,220
 Then what is it?

673
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,400
 If it's not if she's just hot or not,

674
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,760
 if she's actually holy, what does it look like

675
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,880
 for a girl to be holy?

676
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,720
 He says in verse four,

677
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,180
 "But let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart,

678
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,620
 "with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,

679
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,500
 "which in God's sight is very precious."

680
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,000
 Ladies, let me just say, you want that.

681
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,840
 You don't want a man who will look at you.

682
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,840
 You want someone that in God's sight is very precious.

683
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,880
 That when God looks at you, he's like, she gets it.

684
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:50,000
 She's focusing on her soul, not herself.

685
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,020
 She gets it.

686
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,800
 She gets that life is about me and men.

687
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,960
 May we be men who do not feed and help the enemy

688
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,560
 in convincing women that they have to be

689
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,440
 both attend physically and spiritually

690
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,480
 and create these unrealistic expectations

691
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,440
 that keeps them chasing and chasing and chasing

692
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,040
 and striving and striving and striving.

693
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,200
 May we be men who does not celebrate

694
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,480
 and lead them to believe that it's about the outward,

695
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,320
 but be men who chase after the inside of a woman,

696
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,800
 the heart, her soul.

697
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,240
 The last thing we should be asking is,

698
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,860
 can she follow you?

699
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:39,320
 Can she follow you?

700
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,940
 As you, we talked about in the Is He Datable

701
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,520
 that the Bible tells us the roles of how Christ

702
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,360
 is the head of every man and the man, the head of a woman.

703
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,660
 And the head of Christ is God.

704
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,800
 And so there's these roles we see, not ranks, these roles,

705
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,000
 whereas the man's responsibility,

706
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,300
 the opportunity to get to lead and servant lead his woman.

707
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,240
 But in order to do that, there are things that he must be

708
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,760
 for her to feel like he is worth following.

709
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,140
 He is worth respecting.

710
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,960
 But she has to be able to see the right things

711
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,120
 and be able to tell the right things.

712
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,920
 She is datable if she's able to follow you.

713
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,040
 But first you have to ask yourself as the leader,

714
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,960
 I had to turn it back to the men for just a moment.

715
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
 You have to be able to ask yourself and you

716
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,000
 and the community around you,

717
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,340
 a brother should be able to say, yeah, yeah,

718
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,500
 when I read this, you are that man.

719
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,920
 You are someone she can follow.

720
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,760
 Now we don't know yet,

721
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,200
 but I talk about if she actually can,

722
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,720
 but you are someone that is living for the Lord,

723
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,120
 that you are living this way,

724
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,340
 that we would happily send you to go and pursue a woman

725
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,280
 that is datable.

726
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,000
 Because the reality is, is if you find a girl

727
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,480
 who hasn't given her heart to Jesus,

728
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,920
 who hasn't found her value in the blood of Jesus

729
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,000
 and the price paid for her,

730
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,600
 the reality is, is that she won't follow you.

731
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,260
 She's going to need you.

732
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,280
 She's going to like desperately need you

733
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,640
 to be the source of her life,

734
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,220
 the lifeline to her joy and satisfaction and significance.

735
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,300
 One of the most attractive things when I was,

736
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,420
 my fiancee, Jenna,

737
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,420
 when I was assessing if I should ask her to be my girlfriend

738
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,700
 we went to this coffee, we were talking,

739
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,980
 and I was just asking her questions to see

740
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,440
 who is this girl right now?

741
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,020
 Like, is she an individual who understands her role

742
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,600
 as a daughter of the King?

743
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,000
 Or is she looking to me to be her only kind

744
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,200
 of spiritual connection to God?

745
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,040
 And she said this line that when she said it,

746
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,120
 I literally was like, marry me right now.

747
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,600
 She said this, she said, here's what I think.

748
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,160
 I think a lot of people, they idolize relationships.

749
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,200
 And I know that God wants us to be in a relationship.

750
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,240
 And I know that marriage is a good thing,

751
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,560
 but so many people around me,

752
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,320
 they're just so obsessed with idolizing relationships.

753
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,820
 And that tells her that they're not living

754
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,500
 as if Jesus is coming back tomorrow.

755
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,120
 Because here's what I know, JD.

756
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,700
 I just met this girl, okay?

757
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,400
 I'm like, okay, keep on listening.

758
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,160
 She says, JD, I, one day,

759
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,200
 if I die or if Jesus returns,

760
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,020
 I'm gonna stand before my creator.

761
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,320
 And he is not gonna say, well done, my good and faithful,

762
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,480
 married person to JD or to this person.

763
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,640
 He's gonna say, well done, my good and faithful, Jenna.

764
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,720
 At least that's what I hope he's gonna say.

765
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,580
 I'm on a mission for Jesus to look at me and say,

766
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,860
 well done, my good and faithful, Jenna.

767
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,460
 I don't need a relationship

768
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,280
 because I'm on a mission for Jesus.

769
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,900
 She understood the relationship

770
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
 and the opportunity she had with God.

771
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,000
 And when a woman understands what it's like

772
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,140
 to fully follow Jesus,

773
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,040
 it makes it that much easier for her to identify

774
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,140
 how to follow you and to keep following Jesus.

775
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,180
 What I loved about that statement from her

776
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,500
 is that that showed me that I did not feel responsible

777
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,000
 to ignite her flame for Christ.

778
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,780
 I simply now was given the responsibility to just fan it.

779
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,780
 I got to fan her dreams.

780
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,720
 I got to encourage, I get to encourage her hopes

781
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,780
 for her ministry and the women around her

782
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,860
 and the passions that she has.

783
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,140
 Why?

784
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,360
 Because she's following Jesus.

785
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,980
 She doesn't need me.

786
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,120
 She has a real relationship with him all on her own.

787
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,820
 And so it's really important

788
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,260
 that as I'm about to read this and wrap up,

789
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,140
 we understand what it looks like

790
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,940
 to have roles as individuals,

791
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,260
 but then roles in a relationship with one another.

792
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,100
 And like we always say,

793
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,220
 like the Bible doesn't talk about dating.

794
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,400
 However, we believe that dating is a destination

795
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,500
 that leads to a promise, which is marriage.

796
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,020
 The Bible is full about helpful things

797
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,300
 about God's design for marriage.

798
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,200
 And so we oftentimes pull from that

799
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,000
 to tell us how we should date

800
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,980
 to align with what God would have for us for marriage.

801
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,260
 And if you've been to a wedding,

802
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,580
 you've heard the pastor read probably from Ephesians 5.

803
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,040
 He says this, verse 21.

804
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,820
 I want you to first acknowledge this,

805
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,820
 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.

806
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,980
 Wives and husbands.

807
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,160
 Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,

808
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,680
 for the husband is the head of the wife,

809
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,420
 even as Christ is the head of the church,

810
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,300
 his body, and is himself its savior.

811
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,820
 Now, as the church submits to Christ,

812
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,580
 so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.

813
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,420
 Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church

814
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,820
 and gave himself up for her,

815
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,420
 that he might sanctify her,

816
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,040
 having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,

817
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,660
 so that he might present the church to himself in splendor

818
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,420
 without spot or wrinkle or any such thing

819
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,180
 that she might be holy and without blemish.

820
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,500
 Go to verse 33, it says,

821
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,500
 "However, let each one of you love his wife as himself,

822
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,580
 and let the wife see that she respects her husband."

823
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,760
 I know that this passage mentions the S word

824
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,200
 that we don't like, submit.

825
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,280
 There's a bad connotation on this word, submission,

826
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,980
 but it's actually a really beautiful thing

827
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,760
 when you take time, I don't have time to go into right now,

828
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,600
 but when you take time to see how like intricate

829
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,000
 and the details God is about the way that he designed

830
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,520
 the relationship between man and woman

831
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,960
 and husband and wife to exemplify into parallel

832
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,720
 with his relationship with us, with Jesus with us,

833
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,280
 with the church, it is just amazing, it's masterful.

834
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,000
 And I would encourage you to really get down

835
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,760
 and learn what it looks like

836
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,600
 to understand your role in a relationship.

837
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,860
 But part of the woman's role we see here very plainly

838
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:51,060
 is that she is called to follow and respect the man

839
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,720
 as the leader of the household.

840
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,880
 Does not mean she's less than,

841
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,760
 but she gets the opportunity to follow the man.

842
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,680
 And you have to ask yourself, like I said, man,

843
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,400
 are you someone worth following?

844
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,720
 But is she someone who knows how to follow you?

845
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,800
 Or are you compromising?

846
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,960
 Are you settling?

847
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,780
 Are you looking for someone and convincing yourself

848
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,100
 that, yeah, she'll know how to like be in a relationship

849
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,160
 with God and all these different things

850
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,800
 and trying to convince yourself

851
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,280
 of something that's not a reality.

852
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,840
 Because if she is not ready to follow you,

853
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,540
 you both will end up being hurt and losing in the end.

854
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,960
 David had mentioned a illustration that he had heard before

855
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,280
 where there was this amazing race,

856
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,120
 marriage edition, husband and wife.

857
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,840
 And when you watch the race as they would come,

858
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,320
 you know, they're married, they're so in love,

859
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,160
 they haven't seen each other,

860
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,320
 they've gone through all these hard things,

861
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,360
 these different obstacles,

862
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,840
 and they get up to each other, high five, go.

863
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,960
 They don't stop and be like, so how was your time?

864
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,780
 Like, how was this?

865
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,620
 How was that?

866
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,700
 They look into each other's eyes,

867
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,360
 engage in an intimate moment.

868
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,320
 No, why?

869
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,360
 Because they were on a mission.

870
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,880
 They were on a mission, they were on a destination to win,

871
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,280
 to claim victory as a couple together.

872
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,120
 You wanna look for someone who is on mission with you.

873
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,560
 A woman that knows what it looks like to follow you,

874
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,240
 but more importantly, to follow Jesus with you.

875
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,200
 So just ask yourself, is she on the same page as you

876
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,340
 when it comes to the vision of the covenant of marriage?

877
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,260
 That is an everlasting covenant,

878
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,740
 that divorce is not an option.

879
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,260
 The divorce is not even in the category,

880
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,100
 it's not in the picture.

881
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,120
 Does she understand what you want to lead in a marriage?

882
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,620
 Does she understand that you have the desire,

883
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,900
 hopefully, to make disciples in your home?

884
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,300
 That the church is us, and we have a responsibility

885
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,060
 to invite people in, to show hospitality?

886
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,360
 Or does she wanna be one of those couples

887
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,500
 that once you get married, we have those people

888
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,180
 that once they got married, you never saw them again,

889
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
 and just bounced?

890
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,420
 But the ministry does not stop.

891
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,220
 The end goal is not marriage.

892
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,260
 If the end goal for her is marriage,

893
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,660
 what a sad life after your 20s.

894
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,880
 Like, if that's all, if that's everything,

895
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,660
 is marriage, like, once I get married, my life's set.

896
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,080
 That's gonna, I mean,

897
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,960
 the guy's gonna let you down real quick.

898
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,400
 You're gonna be like, this is it?

899
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,000
 This is all I planned for?

900
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,360
 You want someone who is ready to run the amazing race

901
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,060
 with Jesus, with you, on mission, together.

902
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,660
 A woman who understands that, hey, life is not about us,

903
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,340
 life is about serving others.

904
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,380
 It's not about building our own kingdom,

905
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,860
 it's about building God's kingdom.

906
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,740
 It's not about posting and building our own love story

907
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,860
 and sharing it with the world.

908
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,980
 It's about telling the world

909
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,160
 of the greatest love story to ever exist,

910
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,060
 the gospel of Jesus Christ.

911
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,600
 Are you a leader worth following?

912
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,200
 And is she able to follow you?

913
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
 And are you both able to follow Jesus

914
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,760
 in this amazing race called life, a life with Him?

915
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,400
 I'll close with this.

916
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,520
 I know that I got this feedback from some girls.

917
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,960
 If you go to the comments on YouTube

918
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,440
 or coming down up front after the last message

919
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,800
 on is he dateable, they were like,

920
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,640
 this is all nice in theory.

921
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,520
 And when I write it down in my journal,

922
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,020
 but then I walk out and I'm like, these guys don't exist.

923
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,220
 First of that, I would say, that's not true.

924
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,000
 They exist.

925
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,500
 They exist.

926
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,960
 Be patient, they exist.

927
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,180
 But then also to that, I know that guys,

928
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,540
 you could be feeling the same thing right now.

929
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:37,820
 That like, man, do girls like this really exist?

930
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,940
 Or do relationships like this really exist?

931
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,780
 Could I be a man like this who really exists?

932
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,660
 Could God really provide something like this?

933
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,980
 'Cause I think that some of you are not convinced

934
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,220
 that you are worthy of a love life like this.

935
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,040
 And I will tell you something.

936
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,040
 Jesus rewrites history.

937
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,540
 He takes everything about your past and He redeems it.

938
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,820
 He changes it.

939
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,560
 He makes you new.

940
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,060
 No matter how many people you slept with,

941
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,580
 no matter how many images you've looked at,

942
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,540
 no matter how many relationships have ended poorly,

943
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,980
 how many times you've cheated on.

944
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,220
 And guys, I know, I know, there are many of you

945
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,700
 that are okay with just friends with benefits

946
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,740
 and hooking up every weekend

947
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,900
 because you've tried to emotionally connect

948
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,100
 with a girl before and she hurt you.

949
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,580
 She cheated on you.

950
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,500
 She left you when things got hard

951
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,580
 or she just got bored with you.

952
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,900
 And I know since then, He made the decision,

953
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,900
 like I'm kind of out on that.

954
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,160
 Maybe when I'm like maybe way later in life.

955
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,360
 But Jesus rewrites history.

956
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,980
 His love for you can change the way that you love others,

957
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,660
 the way that you experience love and intimacy with others.

958
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,840
 And I know for some of you girls,

959
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,620
 you might be like, check, check, check, I'm dateable.

960
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,460
 Where are they?

961
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,600
 Let's just be real.

962
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,820
 Maybe you're like, hello, beep, beep,

963
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,920
 can I get a neon sign?

964
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,540
 I would say to you, be patient.

965
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:26,040
 Be patient and have perspective.

966
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,060
 Never lose perspective on all that you have available to you

967
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:39,500
 in your already abiding relationship with Jesus.

968
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,980
 It's enough.

969
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,080
 Even when it doesn't feel like it.

970
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,880
 Even in those lonely hours, I've been there, it's enough.

971
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,820
 And trust me, you don't wanna settle.

972
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,060
 You'd rather be 40 and single than 40 and miserable

973
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,680
 in a relationship with someone

974
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,600
 that wasn't putting in the work to be this kind of person.

975
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:09,900
 Ladies, if this isn't you, it's worth it.

976
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,940
 Let Jesus begin to change your life

977
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,260
 and be a girl who has given her heart to Jesus,

978
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,400
 not just with her words, but with her life.

979
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,180
 A girl who understands her value,

980
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,940
 that she was created by the God of the universe,

981
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,140
 bought with a price by the blood of his son.

982
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,600
 And a girl who understands what it looks like

983
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,580
 to follow a man after God's own heart.

984
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,460
 You can do it.

985
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,260
 I know it's hard.

986
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,720
 I know it might seem unrealistic, but you can do it.

987
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,260
 After three months of testing and questioning,

988
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,540
 we found out that I indeed am the match

989
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,260
 for Ryan Michaels' kidney.

990
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,940
 And I get...

991
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,440
 (congregation applauding)

992
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,020
 I get to give my kidney to Ryan in two weeks from today,

993
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,140
 which is just unbelievable.

994
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,220
 I don't say that to be like, "Oh my God."

995
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,300
 Like, please do not come down here and say that so often.

996
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,200
 Don't, that's not why I'm sharing this.

997
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,320
 I'm sharing this because in that picture,

998
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:12,620
 we were super happy, but there were months of despair.

999
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:18,780
 Ryan on dialysis, Ryan and his wife crying to me,

1000
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:24,500
 Ryan in ICU, suffering on suffering on suffering.

1001
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,420
 But you know what made that moment so joyful

1002
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,300
 and so exciting?

1003
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,180
 When I got that call and they said,

1004
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,820
 "Mr. Rogers, you are a match."

1005
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,240
 I stood up, I began to scream, why?

1006
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,540
 Because I knew that they were right

1007
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,040
 because they did so much work to know that they know

1008
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,740
 that they know that I was a match for Ryan.

1009
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,300
 There was not a doubt in my mind,

1010
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,540
 not a question in my mind,

1011
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:52,140
 because we put in so much work to make sure

1012
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,340
 that when I go and they give my kidney to Ryan,

1013
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,900
 his body would be able to accept it

1014
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,660
 because they have put in so much work,

1015
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,580
 asked all the right questions.

1016
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,060
 And I would say to you, it's the same way.

1017
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,840
 When you are in a relationship, it should feel so right.

1018
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,320
 Joy should come out of it.

1019
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,760
 Love should come out of it.

1020
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,480
 Peace, not chaos, excitement for what God is doing

1021
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,360
 and the story that he's writing in your life.

1022
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,800
 That should be what you're experiencing

1023
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,520
 if it's marked by someone who is truly datable God's way.

1024
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,800
 But you only know that if you're willing to go

1025
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,520
 through the hard work, asking the right questions,

1026
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,960
 making the right changes in your life to say,

1027
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,200
 "I will not date how culture tells me to date.

1028
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,560
 "I will not settle for anyone who does not understand

1029
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,440
 "their value and worth from Jesus.

1030
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,980
 "I will do this the right way."

1031
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,180
 And if you will, you will experience life on mission.

1032
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,340
 You will experience life in an amazing way

1033
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,540
 according to what God designed.

1034
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,260
 That's what he wants from you.

1035
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,540
 Anything else, you're settling,

1036
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,900
 but there's better because of Jesus.

1037
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,060
 This is possible.

1038
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,140
 And I want it to be possible for every person in this room,

1039
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,980
 whether single, dating, engaged, married,

1040
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,020
 whatever stage, you understand where your worth comes from

1041
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,380
 and it changes the way you live your life.

1042
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:17,140
 I hope that every person in here is datable,

1043
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,020
 not because of the way they look or act

1044
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,020
 or 'cause they do the right things,

1045
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,380
 because they've given their life to Jesus.

1046
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,220
 Let's pray.

1047
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,260
 God, we just...

1048
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,100
 I know a talk like this can potentially bring forth shame

1049
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,480
 and guilt, and right now, God,

1050
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,140
 I ask that you would remove that.

1051
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,860
 You are not a God of shame, but of love and of peace,

1052
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,460
 of mercy.

1053
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,420
 If there's someone right now who feels uncomfortable,

1054
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,220
 would you wrap them up in your love?

1055
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,840
 If there's someone right now in a relationship

1056
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,300
 that is heading down a path towards destruction

1057
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,320
 and devastation, would you bring clarity right now?

1058
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,960
 That they would end that relationship

1059
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,880
 and be committed to the right relationship with you.

1060
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,480
 I pray against the rising rates of divorce

1061
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,520
 on this generation.

1062
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,760
 I pray that this generation will be marked by people

1063
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,180
 who say, "We will do the work necessary to be different.

1064
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,960
 We will do the work necessary

1065
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,600
 to make sure that we pursue and honor and love

1066
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,120
 our brothers and sisters the way that God calls us to,

1067
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,520
 trusting that it's better,

1068
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,160
 despite what we feel or what we think or anything else.

1069
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,720
 We trust that it's better because God, you said it's better."

1070
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:45,160
 I pray, God, that heartbreak would diminish,

1071
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:50,960
 cheating would stop, that disciples would be made,

1072
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,320
 that generations on generations on generations

1073
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,840
 are impacted because we made a stand to be different.

1074
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,640
 Not on our own strength, not on our own good deeds

1075
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,000
 or our own performance, but because we are people

1076
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,880
 who are marked by Jesus.

1077
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,280
 Because we trust Him with our lives.

1078
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,160
 We trust Him with our relationships.

1079
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,760
 Come and do your work.

1080
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,400
 Speak to us now as we respond in worship.

1081
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,560
 In that I pray, amen.
