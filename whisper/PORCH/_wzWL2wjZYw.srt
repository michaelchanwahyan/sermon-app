1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:27,120
 - Hello, hello, how we doing?

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,360
 Greetings, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,600
 as you gather in the chapel there,

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,720
 we're praying for you as well.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,800
 And anyone listening around the world,

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,180
 tuning in, streaming live, we're excited to be here.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,720
 We just sang a song here in Dallas that says,

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,120
 "Nothing formed against me will stand."

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,240
 And life doesn't always feel that way.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,880
 And in fact, I'll start by asking you this question.

12
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,840
 Have you ever been facing accusation,

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,880
 condemnation, or separation?

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
 Are these things that you've ever faced?

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
 I'll tell you about a time that I did,

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,560
 and that's just as a disclaimer

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,020
 in case you're a guest with us.

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,360
 I did not walk with Jesus in college.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,600
 I was not a Christian.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,440
 I was not a believer.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
 I was a fool.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,600
 I was a complete and total idiot in college.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,500
 And so I was pursuing the things of the world.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,880
 I thought there was life in girls.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,600
 I thought there was life in the party,

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,880
 life in getting drunk, life in getting in a fight.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,200
 I mean, these were my life goals, if you will.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,560
 And so this one particular evening in college,

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,040
 we kind of, this girl had invited us to a party,

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,880
 but we really didn't want to go there.

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,360
 We went to another party, and when that party was over,

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,720
 we were looking for the after party.

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,080
 So we thought at this point, we'd go to this girl's party.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,680
 So we go to her house, but it's dead.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,480
 And like, no, you know, there's nothing going on.

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
 It's just like, man, we can't win.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,080
 You know, there's nothing going on.

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,480
 We walk in, there's a couple of people

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,280
 sitting around the island in the kitchen talking.

40
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,520
 We're like, "Hey, where's our friend?"

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,800
 They're like, "She's asleep."

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,560
 We're like, "Oh, okay, great, sweet party."

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
 And so as we're leaving, my buddy, the guy that I'm with,

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
 there's three of us, and I'm with this guy,

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
 and he gets in this little verbal argument

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,440
 with one of the girls that was sitting there in the kitchen,

47
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,220
 kind of like insulting their party

48
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,120
 because it wasn't happening.

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,200
 He's leaving, too much to drink, you know, you get it.

50
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,880
 And so as we're walking out,

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,160
 they get in this verbal argument.

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,240
 I'm like, "Man, we just can't win."

53
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,400
 And as it gets outside onto the sidewalk,

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,840
 it escalates to such a point where like,

55
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,360
 she's in his face, you know, like, you know, doing this.

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,920
 And I'm like, "I don't know where this is going

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,160
 "with, you know, Xena the warrior princess

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
 "or what's about to happen."

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,240
 But, and as he's just like, "Get away from me."

60
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,960
 And she says, "Boom!"

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,880
 And I mean, Ronda Rousey, this fool.

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,080
 And he's like, "Whoa," you know, like,

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,160
 "JP, did you see that?"

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,440
 I'm like, "How could I miss it?"

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
 Like, "We can't win, where is this gonna go?"

66
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,720
 And she's just still like, "Come on, what?"

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,080
 You know, and I'm like, "Oh my goodness,

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,840
 "this is not gonna go well for us, right?"

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,680
 And so I'm like, "Let's go, let's go."

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,760
 Well, meanwhile, all of these guys come out of the woodwork.

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,480
 Like, I don't know if they were sleeping in the bushes

72
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,040
 or what was going on, but they just start closing in on us.

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,660
 I'm like, "We cannot win, okay, let's go.

74
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,240
 "Come on, buddy, let's go, let's go."

75
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,560
 We get in my truck, like we're running from these guys,

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
 running from, you know, Ronda Rousey.

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,160
 And we get in my truck and as we're pulling away,

78
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,040
 which is foolish because we've been drinking,

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,440
 as we're pulling away, whoop, whoop.

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,520
 And I'm like, "Oh, we cannot win."

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,920
 And so I stop and this police officer comes to my door,

82
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,800
 opens the door, a Coors Light spills out from my truck

83
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 onto his shoes, to which he says, "You're going to jail."

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:43,720
 And so they cuffed me, put me in the back of the car,

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,960
 the police car, and I sit there for an hour and a half

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
 and here's what happens.

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,920
 For an hour and a half, they begin to meet

88
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,720
 with the other guys who came out of the woodworks,

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,420
 you know, the secret ninjas that showed up.

90
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,840
 They begin to meet with them one by one

91
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,080
 and right outside the window of where I'm at

92
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,880
 in the back of the car, and I listened to these guys

93
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,240
 and they said, "Yeah, man, they were beating up on her."

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
 And I'm like, "What?"

95
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,560
 And I find out the reason that the police

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
 were so aggressive with us was the call they got

97
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,620
 was that there were three men beating up

98
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,800
 on this Baylor student, this girl.

99
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,080
 That's the call they got.

100
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,960
 And I'm like, "Oh no, like we cannot win."

101
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
 I'm sitting back there and I'm continuing

102
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,280
 to listen to accusation after accusation.

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,120
 It's like, "Yeah, they came out, you know,

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,440
 "they were just looking for a fight.

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,480
 "They got in a fight with the,"

106
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,960
 and I'm just like, "Are you serious?"

107
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 Then I find out that this girl, said girl,

108
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
 is the granddaughter to the judge in Waco.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,400
 And I'm just like, I'm like saying my goodbyes mentally,

110
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,280
 like wonder if prison is air conditioned, you know.

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,800
 These are the questions like I can't win.

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,280
 Have you ever been in this place

113
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,520
 where you find yourself in such a hole,

114
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,500
 it's like there's no way you're going to dig out.

115
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,080
 It's like a wave knocks you over

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,040
 and you get up and another wave knocks you over

117
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,320
 and you get up and another wave knocks you over.

118
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,580
 Now don't get me wrong, we were fools.

119
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,200
 We were guilty.

120
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,120
 We just weren't that guilty, right?

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
 We weren't guilty of all of the accusations

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,980
 that were coming against us, but we were certainly guilty.

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,380
 Certainly deserved some punishment.

124
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,460
 And I don't know if you've ever been in this place in life

125
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,660
 and it may not, you may be here

126
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,380
 and you've walked with Jesus for a while,

127
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,140
 praise God for that.

128
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,220
 And it may not be that you're facing

129
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,420
 the kind of accusations that I was facing

130
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,680
 or the kind of condemnation

131
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
 or the kind of separation that I was facing.

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,740
 But maybe you've gone through a breakup,

133
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,940
 maybe it's that you were laid off,

134
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,460
 maybe your roommate moved out or you're being evicted,

135
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,060
 you can't pay rent, maybe just a difficult day,

136
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,820
 maybe you didn't get the promotion.

137
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,860
 And you're in this place

138
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
 where people are saying things about you

139
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,300
 and it feels like God is far.

140
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,420
 Like you said, okay, I'm a Christian,

141
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,140
 like I thought life would be a little easier than this

142
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,860
 and it feels like God is far from you

143
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,880
 and this is why you desperately, desperately

144
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,320
 need this promise tonight

145
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,940
 because this is for when you are tempted

146
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,420
 to doubt that God is not in this,

147
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,380
 this is when you are tempted to doubt God's love for you,

148
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,540
 this is why the apostle Paul

149
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,300
 scribed this passage to the church in Rome,

150
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,540
 a people group whom he had not met

151
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,140
 in the 50th century,

152
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:41,100
 saying, hey, you guys need to hear this.

153
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,400
 You need to hear this promise from God to you

154
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,640
 and so tonight we're in the finale of Romans 8,

155
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,360
 the series that we titled Walk by the Spirit

156
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
 and here's the subject,

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,500
 I wanna give it to you, write it down if you can.

158
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,420
 It's this, it's the love of God

159
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,920
 cuts through all accusations,

160
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,760
 condemnation and separation

161
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,280
 to give you good without reservation.

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
 I'll say it again so you can tweet it out,

163
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
 write it down, whatever you're going to do,

164
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,340
 the love of God cuts through all accusations,

165
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,280
 condemnation and separation

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,320
 to give you good without reservation.

167
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,680
 That is the best summary I could come up with

168
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,680
 out of this text, let me read it to you.

169
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,340
 We've looked at the Christian life,

170
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,500
 we talked about letting the spirit drive,

171
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,080
 how we're God's children,

172
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,580
 all out of Romans chapter eight,

173
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,580
 we talked about how God waits for us

174
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,660
 and then last, two weeks ago rather,

175
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,180
 we took a break last week from Romans 8,

176
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,740
 two weeks ago we talked about how God flips

177
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,180
 everything for your good and so Paul says,

178
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,040
 what then, if this is true, what then,

179
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,420
 shall we say in response to these things?

180
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,900
 If God is for us, who can be against us?

181
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,060
 He who did not spare his own son

182
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,720
 but gave him up for us all,

183
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,040
 how will he not also along with him

184
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,740
 graciously give us all things?

185
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,140
 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?

186
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,460
 It is God who justifies.

187
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,140
 Who then is the one who condemns?

188
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,580
 No one.

189
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,900
 Christ Jesus who died, more than that,

190
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,900
 who was raised to life is at the right hand of God

191
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,520
 and is also interceding for us.

192
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,860
 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

193
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,540
 Shall trouble or hardship or persecution

194
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,740
 or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?

195
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,700
 As it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.

196
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,660
 We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.

197
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,660
 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors

198
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,820
 through him who loved us.

199
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
 For I am convinced, Paul writes,

200
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,060
 for I am convinced that neither death nor life,

201
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
 neither angels nor demons,

202
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,820
 neither the present nor the future,

203
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,140
 nor any powers, neither height nor depth,

204
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,340
 nor anything else in all creation

205
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,460
 will be able to separate us from the love of God

206
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,900
 that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

207
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,580
 Amen.

208
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,060
 And so we're gonna go through that passage verse by verse.

209
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,180
 And then I'm gonna give you four truths from the passage

210
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,820
 as we wrap up this amazing chapter in the scriptures.

211
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,220
 And so Paul is coming out, hey, you have been,

212
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,900
 God is going to glorify you.

213
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,760
 This is the specific good that he's giving to you.

214
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,140
 We know that in all things,

215
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,760
 God works together for the good of those who love him,

216
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,060
 who have been called according to his purpose.

217
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,780
 And two weeks ago, if you missed it,

218
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,580
 listen on the app or online if you missed it,

219
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,780
 two weeks ago we talked about

220
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,780
 what that good is specifically.

221
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,580
 And so Paul says, what then?

222
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,420
 I like to picture it like a rap battle or something.

223
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,860
 What then?

224
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,280
 What then?

225
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,500
 Shall we say in response to these things,

226
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,440
 if God is for us, who can be against us?

227
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,860
 And I think you're tempted to read that

228
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,180
 like God is on your team.

229
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,740
 Like maybe you're playing three on three basketball

230
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,180
 and you've got LeBron James on your team.

231
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,460
 And you're thinking, who then can stop us?

232
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,840
 That's not what this passage is saying.

233
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,820
 It's not saying that God is on your team

234
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,420
 and he's a really good player.

235
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,060
 It's saying that God is the referee

236
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,880
 and he's already said who's won.

237
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,140
 He's saying, no, God determines the outcome.

238
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,020
 It's been determined.

239
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,500
 And as you play the game, you know you've won

240
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,680
 because God gets to decide who won.

241
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,900
 This is not David and Goliath saying,

242
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,220
 oh, that's a giant, but I've got a bigger giant on my side.

243
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,260
 No, this is David fighting Goliath saying,

244
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,400
 yeah, that's a giant, but my giant controls that giant.

245
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,380
 My giant's numbered his days.

246
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,540
 My giant knows that he's about to die

247
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,640
 by a rock through his forehead, little giant.

248
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,660
 Let's go.

249
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,140
 He who did not spare his own son,

250
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,100
 but gave him up for us all,

251
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,300
 how will he not also along with him

252
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,340
 graciously give us all things?

253
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,580
 In the gospel, God proves himself to be crazy.

254
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,120
 Seems blasphemous.

255
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,260
 I find it to be true.

256
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,700
 I want you to consider if it is that God proves himself

257
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,000
 to be crazy out of his mind for you.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,780
 You say, well, JP, how can you say that?

259
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,700
 Let me just give you a very direct metaphor

260
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,000
 or illustration if I might.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,740
 If your heart fails and you need a heart transplant,

262
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,380
 and I have my son, Weston, my three-year-old son,

263
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,280
 whom I love very, very much, my only son,

264
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,940
 and I say, you need a new heart, take Weston's.

265
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,980
 You can have Weston's heart.

266
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,600
 Oh, I love Weston, but you can have his heart

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,660
 so that you can live.

268
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,140
 Would you not think for a moment, man, this guy's crazy.

269
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,420
 At least he's crazy about me.

270
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,900
 Why? He loves me more than his son.

271
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,100
 I mean, as he loves his son, he loves me,

272
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,460
 that he would give his own son's heart

273
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,300
 so that I might live like this is crazy.

274
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,540
 And what you wouldn't do is you wouldn't wonder,

275
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,640
 wonder if I can ask him for a stick of gum

276
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,100
 or a dollar.

277
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,900
 No, you'd be like this guy who is willingly handing over

278
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,860
 his son for my life would give me anything.

279
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,180
 If he would give his son, he'd give me anything.

280
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,740
 This is what this passage says.

281
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,300
 Who will bring any charge against those

282
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,560
 whom God has chosen?

283
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,520
 Verse 33.

284
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,360
 It is God who justifies.

285
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,500
 It's saying that God is the judge,

286
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,900
 and if the judge is for us, if the one who decides

287
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,820
 whether you are guilty or innocent is completely,

288
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,300
 totally, and radically on your side,

289
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,500
 who can be against you?

290
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,700
 Who then, verse 34, who then is the one who condemns?

291
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,540
 Who?

292
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,620
 Who can condemn us?

293
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,460
 Right?

294
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,100
 He answers it here in the NIV 2011.

295
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,800
 It says no one.

296
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,020
 Because, and here's why the no one,

297
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,540
 because Christ Jesus who died, more than that,

298
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,340
 who was raised to life and is now at the right hand of God,

299
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,500
 he didn't just die for your sins.

300
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 He's alive so that he can intercede for you

301
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,460
 on your behalf to God, the creator

302
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,300
 of the heavens and the earth.

303
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,460
 He's there saying no, he's not guilty.

304
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,780
 Remember, I paid for that.

305
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,180
 I paid for what she did.

306
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,700
 I paid for that abortion.

307
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,440
 I paid for that porn addiction.

308
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,840
 I paid for that sex.

309
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,020
 I paid for that alcoholism.

310
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,740
 I paid for that self-righteousness.

311
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,980
 I paid for that legalism.

312
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,280
 I paid for it on the cross.

313
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,120
 They're not guilty.

314
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,340
 It's been paid for.

315
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,040
 If he's interceding for you,

316
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,700
 right, he's at the right hand of God.

317
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,540
 He's also interceding for you.

318
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,940
 You know what happened in that story?

319
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,780
 It's crazy.

320
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,780
 There I sat in the back of that police car

321
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,900
 waiting for my fate.

322
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,360
 Certainly it wasn't going to be good.

323
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,900
 And the girls whose house it was woke up.

324
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,420
 Police lights in her front yard, you know.

325
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,700
 Of course she woke up.

326
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,840
 And as guy after guy after guy who was,

327
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,940
 they were holding court essentially outside my door.

328
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,880
 He's guilty.

329
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,660
 He's guilty, that guy.

330
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,180
 That guy beat up a girl.

331
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,080
 He's guilty.

332
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,220
 She comes up.

333
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,060
 She goes, no, no.

334
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,100
 Hey guys, listen, policemen, come here.

335
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,500
 No, this is my house.

336
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,560
 I invited these men.

337
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,900
 No, they were here.

338
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,740
 What?

339
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,560
 They hit, I know these guys.

340
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,460
 They hit a girl.

341
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,420
 Hey, they didn't hit you.

342
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,260
 Did they hit?

343
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,100
 They didn't hit you.

344
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,920
 That's what I thought.

345
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,920
 They didn't hit her, see.

346
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,580
 What?

347
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,340
 Open the door.

348
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,580
 Unlock the cuffs.

349
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,680
 Told us to walk home.

350
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,940
 What?

351
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,760
 She steps up.

352
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
 I've never seen anything like it.

353
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,780
 The enemy's like, she had an abortion, God.

354
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,060
 Kill her.

355
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,940
 No, no.

356
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,580
 He's a pervert.

357
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,060
 Did you see what he did in his bathroom all by himself?

358
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,260
 He's a pervert.

359
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,100
 Kill him.

360
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,980
 Did you see them at Lake Louisville hitting the funnel?

361
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,180
 Did you see them on 8th Street?

362
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,300
 Did you see what they were doing?

363
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,380
 They said they loved you.

364
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,460
 Just kill them.

365
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,460
 No, because I killed him.

366
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,380
 Because I killed him instead of them.

367
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,220
 They're mine.

368
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,060
 They're mine.

369
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,340
 They belong to me and my kingdom forever.

370
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,740
 That's the beautiful gospel.

371
00:15:49,740 --> 00:16:00,500
 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

372
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
 Verse 35.

373
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,660
 If God is the judge determining the outcome

374
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,820
 and Christ is giving testimony in your defense,

375
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,860
 not that you're good, but that he's paid for your wrong,

376
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,820
 he's paid for the wrong you've done,

377
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,780
 then if that is the case, shall trouble or hardship

378
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,780
 or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword,

379
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,420
 as it is written, for your sake we face death all day long.

380
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,300
 We are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.

381
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,220
 That comes from Psalm chapter 44, verse 22.

382
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,540
 And I believe that is in here

383
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,660
 because Paul is saying, this is not a new idea.

384
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,500
 People who have followed Jehovah have suffered

385
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,420
 in the Old Testament, BC, before Christ.

386
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,060
 They've suffered from the beginning.

387
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,020
 They've suffered.

388
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,220
 What's gonna separate us from the love of Christ?

389
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,900
 He's saying, Christian, every evil thing

390
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,260
 that could happen to you will happen to Christians.

391
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,820
 In this fallen world, it will happen.

392
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,820
 You trusting in Christ does not mean that you're protected

393
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,380
 from the evil that can happen to you.

394
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,260
 It means that you can overcome it.

395
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,820
 It means that you can rise above it.

396
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,540
 It means that you will be rewarded through it, for it,

397
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,100
 conformed to the image of Christ because of it.

398
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:30,620
 And so you say, we don't have clothes to wear.

399
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,980
 How can God be good?

400
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,020
 We're hungry.

401
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,340
 How can God be good?

402
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,900
 Christians are losing their heads.

403
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,580
 How can God be good?

404
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,180
 Or maybe you say, I'm still single.

405
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,700
 How can God be good?

406
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,020
 I don't make enough money.

407
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,980
 How can God be good?

408
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,220
 I can't pay rent.

409
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,340
 How can God be good?

410
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:01,420
 Verse 37, you win in Jesus, you win.

411
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,340
 No, in all these things,

412
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,300
 we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.

413
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,340
 No, in all of these sufferings, we are more than conquerors.

414
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,380
 It's like a made up word.

415
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,900
 It's like, Paul is not saying, hey, you're an endurer.

416
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,540
 In all these troubles, you're gonna endure.

417
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,380
 You're an endurer.

418
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,900
 He's not saying in all of these troubles,

419
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
 you'll overcome, you're a conqueror.

420
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,940
 He's saying, no, you're, I don't know,

421
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,500
 you're more than a conqueror.

422
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,540
 You'll have something greater than victory.

423
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,180
 Something I don't even have a word for.

424
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,140
 You're more than a conqueror.

425
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,860
 We win.

426
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,180
 Let me tell you something.

427
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,300
 Jesus promised you two things.

428
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,580
 It's John 16, verse 33.

429
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,940
 He says, in this world, you will have trouble.

430
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,180
 I'll read it from the beginning.

431
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,300
 It says this, I have told you these things

432
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,660
 so that in me, you may have peace.

433
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,140
 In this world, in Dallas, in Fort Worth, in Houston,

434
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,020
 and wherever you're at, you're going to have trouble.

435
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,420
 That's, I'm promising you, you're going to have trouble.

436
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,500
 But take heart, I've overcome the world.

437
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,180
 Here are the two promises.

438
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,540
 Promise one, you're going to have trouble.

439
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,420
 Promise two, you can trust him for peace.

440
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,740
 He says, have peace.

441
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,980
 Take heart, I've overcome the world.

442
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,140
 Okay, so here's the two promises.

443
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,580
 You're going to have trouble and you can trust him.

444
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,700
 Do not forsake the second promise because of the first.

445
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,580
 Do not get to the trouble and say, I can't trust God.

446
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,900
 No, when you get to the trouble, you say,

447
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,500
 oh, God told me I was going to have trouble.

448
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,700
 He promised me that.

449
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,340
 That means if I could trust that promise,

450
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,460
 that I could trust this promise, that I could trust him.

451
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,660
 Let the trouble serve as a reminder that you can trust him.

452
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,580
 Oh, I'm suffering.

453
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,180
 Oh, this world is broken, it's hard.

454
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,820
 I feel alone, I feel lonely.

455
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,220
 Oh, that's right, God, Jesus promised me that I would.

456
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,420
 He promised me that I would.

457
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,580
 And what was the other promise?

458
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,980
 Oh, he told me that I could have peace.

459
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,420
 He told me that I could trust him

460
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,820
 because he's overcome the world.

461
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,100
 What this means is he's already promised this future world

462
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,500
 that he's kind of building through his people.

463
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,300
 It's this weird, theologians call it,

464
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,700
 already, not yet theology.

465
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,060
 It's this crazy idea that we're in this world,

466
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,780
 this earth that will be completely new

467
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,460
 and renovated and perfected,

468
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,060
 and we will live in it forever and ever and ever and ever.

469
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,300
 And 100 years from now,

470
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,940
 it will not matter that you're single.

471
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,140
 100 years from now,

472
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,740
 it will not matter that you got laid off.

473
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,660
 100 years from now, it will not matter,

474
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,460
 dare I say it, that you have cancer.

475
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,540
 It won't matter.

476
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:48,220
 A billion years from now, it won't matter.

477
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,340
 For I am, verse 38, convinced

478
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,340
 that neither death nor life,

479
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,100
 neither angels nor demons,

480
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,620
 neither the present nor the future or any powers,

481
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,220
 neither height nor depth,

482
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,100
 nor anything else in all creation

483
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,180
 will be able to separate us from the love of God

484
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,820
 that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

485
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,220
 He's saying there is no state of being,

486
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,940
 no created being, no time, no power, no measurement,

487
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,860
 not anything in all of creation

488
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,420
 that ever was or that ever will be

489
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,980
 that will separate you from God's love for us

490
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,700
 that is secured by Jesus Christ.

491
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,260
 It cannot happen,

492
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,620
 and it leaves no room for the possibility.

493
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,780
 It is an impossibility for you to be separated

494
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,780
 by God's love for you.

495
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,180
 And so let's look at four truths

496
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,660
 from this passage for you tonight.

497
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,540
 We'll go quickly.

498
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,700
 Number one, there is no accusation brought against you

499
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,300
 that will prevail.

500
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,500
 This comes from verses 31 through 33.

501
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 You will not be found guilty of any accusation

502
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,340
 that the enemy will bring against you,

503
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,620
 even those that you are guilty of.

504
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:03,180
 This guy's drunk in the back of this car, innocent.

505
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,740
 What?

506
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,900
 The enemy says you're guilty,

507
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,100
 and Jesus says, nope, I paid his sentence.

508
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,500
 The enemy says you had an abortion, you had sex,

509
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,300
 you're a pervert looking at porn,

510
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,340
 and it wasn't just normal porn.

511
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,740
 It was same-sex porn.

512
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,780
 He said, crazy things against you.

513
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,140
 You cut yourself, you're so gross.

514
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,220
 And Jesus says, no, man, they're not gross, they're mine.

515
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,980
 And they win, and you lose,

516
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,540
 and everything that is mine is theirs.

517
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,300
 It's like they're rewarded in me,

518
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,780
 and I take joy in forgiving them their sins no longer.

519
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,780
 The scripture says no longer holding their sins

520
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,620
 against them.

521
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,260
 It is for God's pleasure that he does it.

522
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,620
 They're not gross, you fool.

523
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,020
 They're mine, my children, praise him.

524
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,100
 At the foot of the cross, there is accusation,

525
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,300
 but at the empty tomb, there is none.

526
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:11,220
 The second truth from this sentence, or this passage,

527
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,460
 there is no condemnation sentenced to you

528
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,840
 that you will pay.

529
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,620
 This comes from verse 34.

530
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,540
 There is no condemnation sentenced to you

531
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,380
 that you will pay.

532
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,460
 You will not be punished or sentenced

533
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,900
 for any said accusation.

534
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,660
 The enemy says, give them to me, let them burn in hell

535
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,580
 like they deserve, and Jesus says, no.

536
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,620
 Remember when I paid an eternal punishment on the cross

537
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,000
 because I'm an eternal God.

538
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
 I'm the only thing on the planet

539
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,540
 that can satisfy an eternal sentence.

540
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,900
 Because I'm an eternal God,

541
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,540
 in a moment it can be satisfied on the cross.

542
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,260
 I've paid for the hell that they deserve.

543
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,500
 They will not go there.

544
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,980
 It was satisfied on me.

545
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,700
 Because of his porn, because of his self-righteousness,

546
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,220
 because of her need for approval from men,

547
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,700
 because of her lack of trust and parents

548
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,240
 or authority or whatever, I paid for it.

549
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,320
 Here's the classic illustration, one I love is,

550
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,980
 it's like you stand before the judge, he's there,

551
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,020
 you're in the courtroom, you're front and center.

552
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,900
 The accusations have been piled on, you're found guilty.

553
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,340
 The judge in his robe stands up from the chair

554
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,340
 and hits the gavel, guilty, guilty.

555
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,000
 And then he steps down from the platform,

556
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,940
 from behind the podium.

557
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,420
 He walks to the ground, he takes his robe off,

558
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,720
 he puts it on you.

559
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,320
 And he says, I'll pay the sentence.

560
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,660
 I'll pay the punishment they deserve.

561
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,700
 And not only that, but my loved one,

562
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,180
 my dear, dear daughter, my dear son,

563
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,340
 you move into my place, you move into my estate,

564
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,320
 my mansion, my palace, where I live, it's yours.

565
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,920
 I'm gonna go to prison for you.

566
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,540
 This is the gospel.

567
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:11,260
 Third truth is there is no separation of you

568
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,100
 from God's love, comes from verses 35 through 36

569
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,640
 and 38 through 39.

570
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,180
 You will know what you've been missing,

571
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,380
 this void in your heart that you've been trying to fill

572
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,720
 with the approval of men, a boyfriend,

573
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,620
 significant others, a job, material things, a car,

574
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,380
 the obsessions that you have, shows, whatnot.

575
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,540
 That void that you've been trying to fill,

576
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
 you'll see it filled completely

577
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,700
 and why you were left wanting that it was only God,

578
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,940
 only Jesus who can fill that.

579
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,460
 And so you will know what you've been missing

580
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,480
 and you will not be missing anything all at one time.

581
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,780
 You will know what you've been missing

582
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,980
 and you will not be missing anything all in one time.

583
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,720
 The fullness of everything you ever wanted realized

584
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,760
 in God's presence.

585
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,620
 And it says that his love, it's following you.

586
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,420
 You can't be separated from it.

587
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,580
 It's following you like your shadow.

588
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,420
 You ever tried to outrun your shadow?

589
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,220
 No, no, it's following you like your shadow.

590
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,980
 And not only that, but it's in front of you like the horizon.

591
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,980
 Everywhere you go, it's behind you.

592
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,980
 Everywhere you go, it's in front of you.

593
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,040
 You turn here, it's there.

594
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,200
 You turn here, it's there.

595
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,020
 You turn here, it's there and there and there, right?

596
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,580
 It's all around you.

597
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,060
 You cannot get away from God's love.

598
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,260
 It won't happen.

599
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,060
 You cannot outrun the love of God.

600
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,860
 You cannot outrun the love of God.

601
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,900
 It's following you like a shadow.

602
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,700
 It's in front of you like the horizon.

603
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,080
 And the fourth truth from this text is this.

604
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,440
 God gives good to you without reservation.

605
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,900
 That's verse 32.

606
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,820
 God gives good to you without reservation.

607
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,940
 And I think this is the one

608
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,580
 you might struggle with the most.

609
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:06,980
 And I think we say, well, what good, JP?

610
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,620
 What good is he giving?

611
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,820
 It's not the good I want.

612
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,860
 I mean, this is the good I want.

613
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
 I don't have it.

614
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,380
 Why don't I have the good that I want?

615
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,020
 And here's what I would tell you as lovingly as I can.

616
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,680
 You don't know what you want.

617
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,820
 Like you don't want,

618
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,500
 what you want today is not what you wanted yesterday.

619
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,960
 It's not what you wanted last week or a year ago.

620
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,180
 You don't know, like who should determine what you want?

621
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,780
 God, the sovereign being creator of the heavens

622
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,660
 and the earth who is been eternity past

623
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,820
 and eternity future?

624
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,260
 Or you in a moment.

625
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,420
 I've heard it said, if we knew everything God does,

626
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,580
 then we would pray for what he gives.

627
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,140
 If we knew everything that God does,

628
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,280
 then we would pray for what he gives.

629
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,380
 The good that you want, it's always changed, man.

630
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,940
 Let me try to prove this to you.

631
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,780
 I've got three children, Presley, who is nine,

632
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,640
 Finley, who is seven, and Weston, who is three.

633
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,140
 I love them all.

634
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,060
 I sat with them this week.

635
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,140
 I asked them this question.

636
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,260
 I said, kiddos, come here.

637
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,740
 If God could give you anything,

638
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,980
 right now, if he would give you anything that you ask for,

639
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,700
 what would you ask him for?

640
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,660
 Presley, my oldest, spoke up.

641
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,220
 She said, I would ask him for enough food

642
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,980
 to feed everyone who was hungry.

643
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,380
 It's where you say, oh, oh, that's sweet.

644
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,500
 Oh, Presley, very benevolent, very kind, very caring.

645
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,260
 What a selfless ask of God, feed those who are hungry.

646
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,540
 Finley, what about you?

647
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,100
 Said, daddy, I would ask for wings so I could fly.

648
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,220
 (congregation laughing)

649
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,940
 Okay, all right, all right, good.

650
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,180
 Weston, what about you?

651
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,580
 I want a donut.

652
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,180
 (congregation laughing)

653
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,140
 Okay, got one.

654
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,980
 The spectrum is enough food to feed everyone and a donut.

655
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,980
 I mean, that's the end of the spectrum.

656
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,060
 These are the things that I want.

657
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,420
 And so he's just like, hey, I want a donut.

658
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,660
 And so I don't know what you would ask for.

659
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,900
 You might be, I want a spouse or a new job or health,

660
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,980
 and you're gonna get up there and you're gonna find out

661
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,780
 that thing that you wanted most, it was a donut.

662
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,860
 He wanted a donut.

663
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,060
 And you're like, no, no, no, JP, how can you say that?

664
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,180
 I'm like, yeah, of course, right?

665
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,740
 We always think that we've graduated

666
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,660
 to some higher learning, some higher level of education

667
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,740
 or understanding, and today is not the day

668
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,220
 we're asking for a donut, just like Weston thinks.

669
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,420
 No, it's not a donut.

670
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,260
 You're gonna get up there and be like, man, how?

671
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,060
 Today, today, it won't be on that day, today,

672
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,980
 how dare you that you kept me single?

673
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,540
 How dare you that you took that loved one?

674
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,620
 How dare you that I didn't get that job?

675
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,700
 You were tempted to doubt God's goodness,

676
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,540
 and you get up there and you're like,

677
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,140
 oh, I was asking you for a donut.

678
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,000
 I see that now.

679
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,940
 I was down there like saying,

680
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,740
 God, would you give me a glazed crispy cream?

681
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,100
 You know, it's like that's the reality of my,

682
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,820
 and it's insult, you're furious.

683
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,100
 Some of you are furious right now.

684
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,280
 How dare you have the audacity?

685
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,460
 For I know that all things work together

686
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,780
 for the good of those who love Him

687
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,680
 who have been called according to His purpose.

688
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,840
 It's not me who has the audacity.

689
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,720
 It's the God that created you that says,

690
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,980
 no, it may not look good, smell good,

691
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,460
 taste good, seem good, but wait for it,

692
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,180
 'cause it will produce good.

693
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,300
 There's not a single person at the cross

694
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,780
 that's like, you tell me,

695
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,020
 like 'cause I'm just, I'll be transparent with you.

696
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,700
 Like I'm following Jesus, Jesus,

697
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,780
 I'm betting the farm on you.

698
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,080
 Everybody says that I'm, everybody says that I'm crazy,

699
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,260
 but then there's something, you're doing something, okay.

700
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,200
 I'm going all in with Jesus.

701
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,860
 Next thing you know, Jesus is screaming on two sticks

702
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,940
 with nails in His hand, bloody.

703
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,160
 Everybody's laughing at Him,

704
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,400
 entertained by His gruesome death.

705
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,460
 And you're standing there and you're,

706
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,020
 I promise you more than any other time in creation,

707
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,320
 you're gonna be tempted to doubt the goodness of God.

708
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,500
 That ain't good.

709
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,340
 That's not good.

710
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,580
 I went all in with Him.

711
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,860
 There's no way that could be good.

712
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,980
 He's dead.

713
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,460
 Wait for it.

714
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,300
 Wait for it, man.

715
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,500
 I'm gonna show you something really amazing.

716
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,100
 Wait for it, trust me.

717
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:41,060
 In this world, you will have trouble and wait for it.

718
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:47,060
 So in summary, let me give this to you again.

719
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,240
 The love of God cuts through all accusations,

720
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,740
 condemnation, and separation

721
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,600
 to give you good without reservation.

722
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,700
 Every night, most nights, not tonight, I'm with you.

723
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,040
 Most nights I tuck my kids in, we say our prayers.

724
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,380
 I ask them two questions all the time.

725
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,280
 Multiple times a week, I ask them the same two questions.

726
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,420
 Same two questions.

727
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:25,220
 Here's what I ask them, Presley, Finley, Weston.

728
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,120
 What would make me stop loving you?

729
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,880
 And the only right answer is nothing.

730
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,560
 And they say nothing, they respond to nothing, Daddy.

731
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,000
 Sometimes they have fun with it,

732
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
 sometimes I have fun with it.

733
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,360
 They'll begin to ask rhetorical questions.

734
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,520
 Daddy, what if we run away from home?

735
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,380
 I'll find you, I won't stop loving you.

736
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,680
 What could make me stop loving you?

737
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
 Daddy, what if someone takes us?

738
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,740
 I'll go Liam Neeson on 'em, man, they'll find you.

739
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,880
 (congregation laughing)

740
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,160
 I will find you.

741
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,760
 Daddy, I mean, the other day, right,

742
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,960
 they're messing with me now, right?

743
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,220
 She's like, what if we worship Satan?

744
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,400
 Come on, man.

745
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,820
 I'm not gonna stop loving you, I'll be sad.

746
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,700
 I'm like, where did you learn that?

747
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,900
 Did your mama teach you that?

748
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,740
 (congregation laughing)

749
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,660
 I'm not gonna stop loving you.

750
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,720
 There's nothing that can make me stop loving you.

751
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,260
 And the second question is this,

752
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,620
 who loves you more than Daddy?

753
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,940
 To which they say God, to which I say, who else?

754
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,180
 And they say no one.

755
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,100
 Sometimes they say Jesus, 'cause we haven't got

756
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,420
 the Trinity thing down and we're working on that.

757
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,220
 I'm like, no, God is Jesus and the Holy Spirit,

758
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,860
 but we'll later, you know?

759
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,440
 But I say, who loves you more than Daddy?

760
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,820
 God.

761
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,620
 There's a daddy that says, there's nothing

762
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,400
 that's gonna make me stop loving you, I promise.

763
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,580
 There's nothing that's going to make me stop loving you.

764
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,820
 I promise you.

765
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,220
 And there is someone who loves you more than me.

766
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,020
 He's perfect.

767
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,740
 My love's so imperfect.

768
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,180
 It's got my emotions and weird insecurities wrapped up in it

769
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:24,180
 but this God, this being, this person loves you perfectly

770
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,300
 more than I do.

771
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,820
 And there's nothing in the world

772
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,460
 that's gonna separate you from that.

773
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,740
 That's what I want you to leave here with.

774
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,360
 I want you to leave here with the promises of God.

775
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,660
 So I'm gonna pray, my friends are gonna sing,

776
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,700
 come up and sing a song over us.

777
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,020
 You can listen to the words as you sit there

778
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,300
 and you'll have a chance to respond in just a moment.

779
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,180
 But I want you to listen carefully

780
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,620
 to the promises of God tonight.

781
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,460
 And so Father, thank you so much

782
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,840
 that your love for us is not conditional.

783
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,980
 God, we don't know unconditional love.

784
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,380
 Every love that we've experienced on this earth

785
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,300
 is some flavor of conditional love

786
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,220
 based on our performance or based on a covenant

787
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,580
 or based on us keeping something

788
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,560
 and yet you love us unconditionally,

789
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,620
 not because of what we can do for you

790
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,020
 but because of what you've done for us.

791
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,380
 Father, would you please help us know that,

792
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,180
 help me understand that for my friends

793
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,900
 who followed you for a while,

794
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,500
 would you awaken that truth and hope in their hearts?

795
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,700
 And for my friends that don't know you in the room

796
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,980
 or that are listening,

797
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,380
 Father, would you please penetrate their hardened hearts,

798
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,340
 crack them open and overwhelm them with this reality

799
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,380
 that they can't run fast enough

800
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,140
 or sin hard enough to get away from your love,

801
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,660
 that there is nothing that's going to separate us from it,

802
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:06,300
 not anything in all of creation,

803
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,580
 not anything that could come against us,

804
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,960
 not anything that could be done to us,

805
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,980
 that there is nothing that will separate us

806
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,300
 from your love, God.

807
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,460
 Would you help us believe that?

808
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,540
 As we sit here and as this song is sung over us,

809
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,060
 Father, would you remind us of these truths?

810
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,400
 We love you so much.

811
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,580

 - For as high as the heavens are above the earth,

842
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,320
 so great is His love for those who fear Him.

843
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,800
 As far as the east is from the west,

844
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,240
 so far has He removed our transgressions from us.

845
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,040
 - God has said, "Never will I leave you.

846
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,520
 "Never will I forsake you."

847
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,860
 So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper.

848
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,280
 "I will not be afraid.

849
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,520
 "What can mere mortals do to me?"

850
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,640
 - The Lord is the everlasting God,

851
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,920
 the creator of all the earth.

852
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,680
 He never grows weak or weary.

853
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,760
 No one can measure the depths of His understanding.

854
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,000
 He has power to the weak and strength to the powerless.

855
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,560
 - Though the mountains be shaken,

856
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,080
 the hills be removed,

857
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,080
 yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken,

858
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,040
 nor my covenant of peace be removed,

859
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,400
 says the Lord who has compassion on you.

860
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,060
 - There is therefore now no condemnation

861
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,200
 for those who are in Christ Jesus,

862
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,600
 for the law of the spirit of life

863
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,840
 has set you free in Christ from the law of sin and death.

864
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,360
 - For I am convinced that neither death nor life,

865
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,680
 neither angels nor demons,

866
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,840
 neither the present nor the future nor any powers,

867
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,400
 neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation

868
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,960
 will be able to separate us from the love of God

869
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,520

895
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,500
 (congregation applauding)

896
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:19,240
 He's crazy about you, man.

897
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,800
 And daughter, sons,

898
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,800
 he is wildly in love, madly, crazy,

899
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:33,120
 truly, deeply, incredibly in love with you.

900
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,000
 And don't you dare,

901
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,960
 don't you dare insult the cross.

902
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,440
 Do not insult the death of Jesus Christ

903
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,560
 by thinking that you've sinned

904
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,360
 to some past degree that he can forgive.

905
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,360
 That would be ridiculous.

906
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,040
 And whenever you face the troubles in this world,

907
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,000
 you hold fast to the reality

908
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,840
 that Jesus looked you in the face

909
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,920
 through the word of God, by the spirit of God,

910
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,460
 and said, "That's gonna happen.

911
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,520
 "You can trust me.

912
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,320
 "I got you.

913
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,600
 "I'm doing something in you

914
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,060
 "that is better than you could ever imagine,

915
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,560
 "and you're going to be somewhere more beautiful

916
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,500
 "than you can fathom with me

917
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,000
 "in the presence of God in his fullness

918
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,380
 "forever and ever and ever and ever and ever,

919
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,940
 "and it's better than anything that you even know of

920
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,360
 "or can think of or can imagine."

921
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,200
 That's the truth.

922
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,520
 It's been so fun to be with you

923
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,120
 moving through this single chapter

924
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,800
 in the Bible that is so rich with theology

925
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,080
 and truths about our God and creator,

926
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,940
 our savior and Lord, his Holy Spirit.

927
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,480
 And so tonight, hang out with us.

928
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,740
 We have ministry partners out there.

929
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,080
 You can go and talk through, interview,

930
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,080
 meet with other organizations that we partner with here

931
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,000
 as we sit on the porch and look out on our city

932
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,460
 and meet the needs of the city.

933
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,120
 If you're going through life alone

934
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,080
 and you're in this place where you're like,

935
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,820
 "Man, I just don't know any cool Christians, man.

936
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,600
 "I don't know anybody that I just even want

937
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,100
 "to hang out with that knows Jesus."

938
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,960
 If you're a guy, I'd strongly encourage you

939
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,120
 to walk down this hallway and into a room over there,

940
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,500
 and there'll be lots of other guys

941
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,380
 asking some of those same questions

942
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,160
 in this deal we call Open Community Group.

943
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,360
 If you're a girl, walk down this hallway

944
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,120
 and in a room over there,

945
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,880
 and there'll be lots of girls in that room

946
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,460
 asking those same sorts of questions.

947
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,160
 If you're looking for community or have questions about it,

948
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,360
 please check that out.

949
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,720
 Up here is gonna be a lot of folks

950
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,320
 with light bulbs on their shirts,

951
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,140
 basically ready to answer your questions,

952
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,760
 to pray with you, to wrestle with you out there.

953
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,080
 Is that what you're telling me?

954
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,240
 Everywhere, they're everywhere.

955
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,040
 Ali Wall says they're everywhere.

956
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,000
 She wants you to know.

957
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,040
 Our people with light bulbs on their shirts.

958
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,840
 And so go up to them, ask them, say,

959
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,280
 "Hey, will you pray for me?"

960
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,160
 That's why they're here.

961
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,220
 You can just walk up and say,

962
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,220
 "Hey, I'd love to ask you this question.

963
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,960
 "I'd love for you to pray for me."

964
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,080
 And they would love to do that.

965
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,040
 I love you guys so much, I really do.

966
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,340
 I wanna change the world with you

967
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,960
 for the sake of Jesus Christ,

968
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,000
 for his glory, for his fame, for his namesake.

969
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,360
 And so, hey, Shane B wrote that song this week,

970
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,200
 we just sang, we were like,

971
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,080
 "Hey, will you write a song?"

972
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,400
 So let's thank him for that.

973
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,820
 [congregation applauding]

974
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,400
 It's a gift.

975
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,960
 It's a gift to the church, these guys and their voices,

976
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,480
 and just the way they lead us in worship.

977
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,200
 And so thank you guys.

978
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,160
 Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
