00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:32,500
 >> Good evening, Dallas.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,520
 And hey to our friends in Fort Worth as well down in Houston.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,480
 And the rest of around the country and even around the globe as you guys tune in.

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,320
 It's so fun to be together, gathered around God's word tonight.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 I'm gonna start with a little bit of a shameless update.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,600
 So I'm gonna be married in three weeks.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,800
 I'm really excited about that.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,720
 >> [APPLAUSE]

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
 >> Man, thank you guys for

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,440
 celebrating that like that.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,040
 I thought it was gonna kind of be an eye roll, like, man, here he comes.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,440
 Now he's gonna tell us how hot she is and all that.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,680
 I'm not gonna make that stop.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,320
 She is starable, I promise.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,720
 But anyway, that's not where I'm going.

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,280
 As, that was stare-able, not terrible.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,520
 So anyway, when a relationship begins,

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,240
 it's usually based on the similarities that you have.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,000
 And you kind of have that first time, maybe it's first date, maybe it's fourth,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,200
 fifth, or sixth.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,320
 But there's that moment where it's like you have the me too moment, or

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
 you have several me too dates.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,880
 It's like, me too, me too, me too, let me guess, you too.

26
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,080
 Me too, and it's just me too, me too, me too.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,000
 And then as the time progresses, and you get to know each other a little more.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Now we're close to the wedding date, so we've dated for nearly a year, and

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,760
 well, six months of dating, six months of engagement,

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,320
 gonna get married in a few weeks.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,840
 And as we, too fast for some of you guys, man, what happened?

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,200
 >> [LAUGH] >> Man, so I talked to our community

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
 group and our parents, I promise.

34
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,040
 So anyway, but as the wedding date gets closer,

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,480
 we have learned more and more about our differences.

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,840
 We are so different.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,280
 There are just, and there's like morally neutral stuff.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,960
 It's not like wrong, it's just different things that we discover about each other.

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,120
 Different ways that we spend our leisure time.

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,600
 Different ways that we connect with God.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,960
 Different ways that we spend money, namely I do, too much,

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,640
 without looking or thinking.

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,200
 And different ways that we think, different ways that we communicate.

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,840
 There's just more and more differences that the me too phase could have never

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,160
 foreseen.

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,520
 And here's the thing about a difference.

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,640
 Anytime a difference approaches you, you can see it, and

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,040
 you've got a choice at that point.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,640
 You can either have a discussion, or you can have a division.

50
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,920
 Those are pretty much your two options.

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,040
 So anytime a difference comes at you, you've got a little fork in the road.

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,160
 You can have a discussion, or you can have a division.

53
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,000
 You can go through it, or it can go through you.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,920
 Those are the two options that you have whenever a difference comes your way.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
 And so tonight, we're gonna talk about how to deal with differences.

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,320
 Dealing with our differences.

57
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,840
 But I don't mean in a relationship context.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,560
 I mean in a human being, societal, earth-wide, city-wide context.

59
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,520
 Because it would seem that we are not excellent at dealing with our differences,

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,560
 and the world is one huge bag of differences.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
 Would you agree?

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,760
 Here's some that I just came up with off the top of my head.

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,400
 I didn't look up diversity.

64
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,200
 I didn't Google anything.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
 I just started thinking, and I came up with different belief systems,

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
 upbringing, skin color, appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality,

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
 gender, political affiliation, tax bracket, income level, sexual views, age,

68
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,400
 marital status, education level, entertainment choices, religions, and

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,080
 a bunch of other things.

70
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,520
 So that's what I came up with just thinking, and you could think of more.

71
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,440
 Somebody in here's like, you left me out.

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
 I'm sorry.

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,240
 But we could go up and down the rows, and you couldn't even make it one row before

74
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,720
 you met somebody who is very different than you, even if just in upbringing.

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,680
 Right?

76
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,200
 We are one big roomful, rooms full, world full of differences.

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,120
 And the unfortunate thing is, is we do not seem to be good at dealing with them.

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,600
 So you could remember recent news posts.

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,120
 There's high racial tensions in the region, in the nation,

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
 because of differences.

81
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,520
 Simple reason.

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,800
 Differences, complex pain, complex fallout, but simple reason why.

83
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,440
 It's because we haven't handled our differences well.

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,920
 Some of us personally carry pain as an individual because of the way someone

85
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,440
 handled a difference poorly.

86
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,000
 And it might have been from years ago.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
 It's like somebody you don't even remember.

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,440
 And it was something that you wouldn't even allow someone as an adult now to

89
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,800
 separate themselves from you on the basis of.

90
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,520
 But for some reason, there was some person that harmed you because of the way you

91
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,280
 looked or the way you appeared or the way you talked.

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,400
 Or something like that.

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,960
 And they did not handle their difference well with you.

94
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,560
 And that's left an imprint on you and the way that you think.

95
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,520
 Some of us carry anger because people in history,

96
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
 people that we've never even met before,

97
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,800
 people in history have failed to handle their differences well.

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,680
 They handle them poorly, famously poorly.

99
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,120
 And some of us carry hurt because two people, namely a mom and a dad,

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
 were not able to handle their differences and make them reconcilable.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,720
 It is imperative that we deal with our differences.

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,640
 When you notice a difference with someone, you can do one of two things.

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,640
 You can discuss or you can divide.

104
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,480
 And the church has always been a place.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,160
 I'm gonna say this again.

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,600
 The church has always been a place for discussion and not division.

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,320
 And so tonight we're gonna continue that work.

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,840
 Because like a married couple getting ready for the road ahead,

109
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,920
 if we don't, as human beings, learn to share this place called earth together,

110
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
 in a better way, the results will be catastrophic.

111
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
 They will continue to be what they've been.

112
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,600
 And we will see entire communities of people separate from one another

113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,720
 because of the same headline, irreconcilable differences.

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,360
 And so if there are Christians in the equation,

115
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,760
 if there are people who claim the name of Christ in the conversation,

116
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,000
 that's actually not an option.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,560
 And so what we're gonna do tonight is we're gonna look for a method

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,280
 on how to handle differences.

119
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,920
 So I can't go into all of the sociological complexities

120
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
 of all the categories that I just named.

121
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
 There's no way we could cover that.

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
 We couldn't even cover one of them.

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,040
 But what we can do is we can look to Jesus Christ for a method,

124
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,280
 a way of thinking that's transferable to any kind of difference

125
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
 that puts a fork in your road.

126
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,840
 Any kind of difference that you meet.

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
 And so we'll go to John chapter four to talk through that with Jesus

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
 and let him see and his company see the example that he is there.

129
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,520
 So John chapter four, if you recognize that,

130
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,320
 that is actually a famous story for a different reason.

131
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,080
 It's because there was a certain woman, a well-known woman.

132
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,960
 It was the woman at the well.

133
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,680
 And so the woman at the well became famous because she had a broken past

134
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,560
 and she came thirsty physically and Jesus came with a solution

135
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
 to fix her spiritual thirst forever,

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,120
 which transferred all the way over to her village.

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
 And so that's why the woman at the well became famous.

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
 But what we're going to do tonight is we're going to focus

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,160
 on this little narrow slice of the story,

140
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,000
 this one little part of John chapter four.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
 And it's the way that Jesus and this woman handle their differences.

142
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,920
 And so if you love John chapter four,

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,000
 because of the woman at the well getting that living water,

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
 you're going to get to see that,

145
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,600
 but we're kind of going to pass by it a little bit more quickly tonight,

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,160
 because what we're going to do is we're going to examine closely

147
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,960
 the way Jesus handled those that he is radically different with,

148
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,240
 different from, I should say.

149
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,320
 So we'll start in John chapter four, verse four.

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,160
 Here we go.

151
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
 Now, Jesus had to pass through Samaria.

152
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
 So that's a different region.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,160
 Jacob's well, which Jacob's well was put there.

154
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,000
 Jacob is like the old Testament figure.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,320
 So 2000 years prior, Jacob lived,

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,120
 he dug a hole in the ground and that's verse six

157
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,320
 and Jacob's well was still there.

158
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,640
 So this is a very old well where people went to get water.

159
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,120
 So Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey,

160
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,880
 Jesus is fully man and fully God, Jesus gets tired.

161
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,080
 So wearied as he was from his journey was sitting beside the well.

162
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,120
 It was about the sixth hour, which means high noon.

163
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
 So this is Texas, August.

164
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,680
 This is Middle East, high noon.

165
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,640
 We understand each other.

166
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,640
 Verse seven, a woman from Samaria came to draw water.

167
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,680
 So picture Jesus sitting beside a hole in the ground

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,720
 that was highly celebrated

169
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
 because of who it had belonged to 2000 years prior.

170
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,120
 And then this woman comes along at high noon.

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
 Now, you've got to know why they were so different

172
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,840
 because that's what brings tension to the story.

173
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,920
 So they've got a few differences.

174
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,440
 I'm gonna give them to you before they start to talk.

175
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,120
 I want to pause here and tell you how they were different.

176
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,760
 Number one, race.

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,360
 So Samaria used to be part of Israel,

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,000
 but they were conquered by a foreign nation

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,320
 hundreds of years prior and produced a region,

180
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,760
 a nation of people who were half Jewish.

181
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,520
 Now, I don't know if you know your Bible well,

182
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,880
 but at this point in time, there is no half Jewish.

183
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,000
 In the Jewish mindset, there's like Jew

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,360
 and then there's everybody else.

185
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,560
 And so there was no almost, there was no close enough.

186
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,400
 At this point in history,

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,320
 the racial lines were very, very clearly drawn

188
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,200
 and the Samaritans were just not included.

189
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,320
 In fact, it was an insult to be called a Samaritan.

190
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,080
 But one time Jesus was in an argument

191
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,560
 with the religious leaders and they said,

192
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,040
 "Isn't it true that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"

193
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,560
 And so that's like a first century insult.

194
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,920
 It didn't really pop to us.

195
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,440
 But that would have stung.

196
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
 To be called a Samaritan was an insult.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 People actually went around Samaria.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,120
 It said Jesus had to pass through Samaria.

199
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,480
 Now, whether that was the quickest way

200
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,400
 or whether that was the plan of God or both, I'm not sure.

201
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,520
 But I know that this was a region that was walked around.

202
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,640
 It would be like, if you need to take off from Dallas

203
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,760
 and walk to Fort Worth and you had to walk around Arlington,

204
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,840
 it's like, I just won't go there.

205
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,680
 I refuse.

206
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
 You guys aren't from Arlington.

207
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,280
 So people went to great length

208
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,960
 to avoid even going to that place.

209
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,800
 Secondly, they had a religious difference.

210
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,040
 So Israel had a special place in the plan of God.

211
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,480
 God himself founded the nation of Israel.

212
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,840
 And it had a special purpose.

213
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,560
 It was to save, at one point in the future,

214
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,600
 was to save the entire world by opening a way back to God.

215
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
 That's Jesus Christ.

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,720
 Jesus, God founded the nation of Israel

217
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,200
 with the goal of launching an entire movement

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,880
 from which would come one man

219
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
 that would save the whole world.

220
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,600
 So the nation of Israel had a special priority place

221
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,160
 in God's plan and they knew it.

222
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,320
 And the Samaritans were considered the worst

223
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
 of the everybody else.

224
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,860
 And then thirdly, gender.

225
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,700
 So men literally ignored women in this culture.

226
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,680
 And by ignored, I mean like you don't see them,

227
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
 like you don't speak to them.

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,480
 And so here, if you've ever felt like,

229
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,760
 man, I feel, I feel like I'm ignored because of my woman.

230
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,920
 In this context, you didn't just feel like it,

231
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,760
 that was reality.

232
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,040
 Your word wasn't permissible in court.

233
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,480
 It is an embarrassing level of separation.

234
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
 And so they've got all that working against them now.

235
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,760
 Okay, so there Jesus is sitting beside the well,

236
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,180
 he's tired and here comes a Samaritan woman

237
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,460
 and the awkwardness of all the history

238
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,440
 just weighs down on them.

239
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,920
 And Jesus starts the conversation by saying,

240
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,660
 give me a drink, which I love.

241
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,080
 That would be as if, picture in the 1960s,

242
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,640
 like right in the heat of all of the civil rights movement,

243
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
 a white person and a black person come

244
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
 to the same public water fountain

245
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,920
 and they just look at each other.

246
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,400
 And then somebody says, you know what?

247
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,480
 Let's share a cup.

248
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,560
 That's the way Jesus starts this conversation,

249
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,000
 except the dividing lines are even more broad

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,100
 than they were for us in the 60s.

251
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,180
 They wouldn't even share land, Jews and Samaritans,

252
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,100
 let alone a water bottle.

253
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
 But that's what Jesus starts with.

254
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,500
 He says, give me a drink.

255
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,060
 For his disciples had gone away in the city to buy food.

256
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,140
 The Samaritan woman, whose name we never know, said to him,

257
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,140
 she just drags the, I love this,

258
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,260
 she just drags the awkwardness

259
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,420
 like right into the middle of the room.

260
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,060
 She has no pretense, she has no tact.

261
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,460
 She just says, how is it that you, a Jew,

262
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,580
 in case you forgot, ask for a drink from me, a woman?

263
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,980
 From Samaria.

264
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,260
 And then, they're so different,

265
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,220
 she just can't get away from it.

266
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,740
 And the narrator even gets in on the deal.

267
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,380
 So your Bible probably has parentheses right there

268
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,580
 that says, for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.

269
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,920
 [congregation laughing]

270
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,740
 This is the first really good idea that we see in the text

271
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,540
 when it comes to dealing with our differences.

272
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,740
 And it actually doesn't come from Jesus,

273
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,660
 though he models it later.

274
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,760
 It's this, point one, don't dismiss differences.

275
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,500
 Don't dismiss them.

276
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
 Don't ignore them.

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,340
 A positive way to say that would be to say,

278
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,540
 acknowledge them.

279
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,460
 Don't dismiss differences.

280
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,260
 She just says, hey, I'm not sure if you noticed,

281
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,340
 but I'm a woman and you're Jewish.

282
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,700
 So we can just kill the elephant in the room,

283
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,140
 we can kill the awkwardness, and then we can move on.

284
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,980
 The narrator does the same.

285
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,580
 Hey, parentheses, these people don't deal with each other.

286
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,900
 That is a really simple first step for us,

287
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,000
 but it is so crucial.

288
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,220
 Just say the obvious out loud, please.

289
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,220
 You cannot reconcile differences if you ignore them.

290
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,260
 That is impossible.

291
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,260
 There's no such thing as a reconciled and ignored difference.

292
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,320
 That does not exist.

293
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,140
 And we fall into this so easy.

294
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,340
 Some people, some of us will go,

295
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,860
 particularly white people, will go so far.

296
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,800
 I'm going there.

297
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,140
 So we'll go so,

298
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,500
 somebody's nervous, like, please don't do this.

299
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,300
 You will go so far and so long

300
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,340
 without just saying someone else's ethnicity

301
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,160
 who's not white.

302
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,660
 It's like you're describing every other attribute.

303
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,380
 It's like, you'll talk about what their height is,

304
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,940
 you'll talk about what their weight is,

305
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,500
 you're down to their dietary habits

306
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,660
 and where they've been in the word,

307
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,940
 and you just will not say, yeah, he's Mexican.

308
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,740
 Some of you are nervous right now because you're like,

309
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,260
 isn't he supposed to say Hispanic?

310
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,240
 He's from Mexico.

311
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,840
 (audience laughing)

312
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,600
 You can say that.

313
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,120
 Don't dismiss differences.

314
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
 This happened last week.

315
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,400
 Last week before the porch,

316
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,920
 I'm in Fort Worth every single Tuesday

317
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,640
 where people are actually over in the Ridgewood Theater

318
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,160
 right now gathering, doing this very same thing.

319
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
 And before the porch last week,

320
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,280
 we were training some new volunteers.

321
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,100
 So we were, I was in a small circle, probably 10 of us,

322
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,240
 and it struck me that someone from the group was missing.

323
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
 There's like a seven-week training process,

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
 and it's like week four.

325
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,200
 And so I knew the group fairly well, but not really well.

326
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,160
 And I could just sense that someone was missing.

327
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
 And so we're like in the circle,

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
 and I'm like, hey guys, who's missing?

329
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
 Everybody's like, oh man, somebody's missing.

330
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,640
 Who is it?

331
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,780
 And we can't figure it out.

332
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,880
 And then my friend Brittany says, oh, I know who it is.

333
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,720
 She's got dark hair.

334
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,320
 I was like, okay, dark hair, yeah.

335
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,660
 Two thirds of the porch, got it.

336
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,800
 And then she says, and she's short.

337
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
 And I'm like, dark hair and short.

338
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,480
 I don't know, I still don't know who it is.

339
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,580
 She said, well, she's quiet too.

340
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,080
 I'm like, oh, I still don't know who it is.

341
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,320
 And then she like leans in and covers her mouth,

342
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,560
 and she says, she's Asian.

343
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,480
 I said, I'm glad we kept that between us.

344
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,000
 Don't want that getting out.

345
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,560
 Hey Brittany, at least you spoke, well done.

346
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
 Isn't this silly?

347
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,440
 Hey, I just want to tell you something.

348
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,600
 You can't be friends with people you're afraid of.

349
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,520
 You can't do that.

350
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,520
 You can't, it just gets silly.

351
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,680
 Like we cannot have real camaraderie

352
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,880
 if we're scared of each other to that degree.

353
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,480
 It just gets a little crazy.

354
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,720
 Ignore differences, make for cheap camaraderie, okay?

355
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,040
 If you can't acknowledge someone else's ethnicity,

356
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,360
 your trust is on E, okay?

357
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,920
 Ignore differences, make for cheap friendship.

358
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,700
 So don't dismiss differences.

359
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,760
 All right, let's go back to the text.

360
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
 Verse 10, John chapter four.

361
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,520
 Keep an eye right here on this next section.

362
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,880
 Keep an eye on the differences that this woman sees.

363
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,200
 And I want you to see Jesus' unwillingness

364
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,680
 to let those differences divide them.

365
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,600
 Keep an eye on that.

366
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,040
 Jesus answered her, if you knew the gift of God

367
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
 and who it is that's saying to you, give me a drink,

368
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,040
 you would have asked him

369
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,120
 and he would have given you living water.

370
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
 And so he comes up and says, hey, share a drink with me.

371
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,040
 And she says, we're way too different for that.

372
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,380
 And he says, hey, if you knew who I was,

373
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,780
 you would have asked me first.

374
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,760
 I promise.

375
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,960
 I'm here to give you water that will satisfy you forever.

376
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,760
 Which is a little bit unusual.

377
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,080
 Just so you get a picture of this.

378
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,880
 This would be like walking out of like a grocery store

379
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,040
 and there's a guy, like a homeless guy,

380
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,600
 like sitting outside the door

381
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,080
 and he like swats you as you go by.

382
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
 And he says, hey, what if I told you

383
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,360
 that I had food for you and you would never be hungry again?

384
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,280
 And you'd be like, what if I told you

385
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,360
 I'm calling the police?

386
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,600
 And so this is like a little bit strange and that's okay.

387
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,960
 So Jesus is saying something a little bit strange.

388
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,440
 She has no idea.

389
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,040
 She has no idea that he's talking about a spiritual reality

390
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,400
 of living water, of soul satisfaction.

391
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,280
 She does not know he's saying that.

392
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,520
 So she's confused.

393
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,080
 The woman said to him, sir,

394
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,200
 you have nothing to draw water with and the well is deep.

395
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,560
 Where do you get that living water?

396
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,680
 And then here she comes and she's gonna be religiously

397
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,080
 and ethnically proud right here.

398
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,760
 So if you wanna see ethnic pride, here it comes.

399
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,600
 Are you greater than our father, Jacob?

400
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,720
 Highlight our, our father, Jacob.

401
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,800
 Are you greater than him?

402
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,640
 He gave us this well.

403
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
 You hear that?

404
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,120
 He gave us this well.

405
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,800
 And he drank from it himself

406
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 as did his sons and his livestock.

407
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,120
 So there's another divide.

408
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 Jesus will not let them be divided.

409
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,800
 Jesus said to her, everyone who drinks of Jacob's water

410
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,480
 is going to be thirsty again.

411
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,600
 You notice how you come here every day,

412
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,560
 but the water that I give you will never be thirsty,

413
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,920
 will make us sure that you are never thirsty again.

414
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
 End of 14.

415
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,840
 The water that I will give you

416
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,040
 will become in you a spring of water,

417
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,120
 welling up to eternal life.

418
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,040
 I will give you water.

419
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,080
 It's not liquid.

420
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,160
 It is spirit and it will never stop.

421
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,960
 It will satisfy you from now.

422
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,160
 It starts right this minute

423
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,680
 and it will never go away ever, ever,

424
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,980
 not even an earthly death.

425
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,600
 And she finally starts to come around,

426
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,740
 but there's one little difference that she's carrying

427
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,240
 that she is even afraid to bring up.

428
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,680
 And that's the fact that, if you know the rest of the story,

429
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,800
 she's been divorced five times

430
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,080
 and she's living with her boyfriend at the moment.

431
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,200
 Now, if that doesn't win you social favor here,

432
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
 it really didn't at this time.

433
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,340
 That's where she is.

434
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,000
 And so Jesus, unwilling to be divided

435
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,320
 because of their differences,

436
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,440
 exposes and acknowledges the difference.

437
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,000
 He won't let it be dismissed.

438
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,120
 Jesus said to her, "Okay, you want the living water?

439
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,280
 "Go call your husband."

440
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,940
 And the woman answered him, "I have no husband."

441
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,840
 Which is kind of a conversation in her, right?

442
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's like a half truth.

443
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,160
 It's like, "Hey, go call your husband.

444
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
 "If you want the living water, I'm sure he does too.

445
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
 "Why don't you bring him?"

446
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,480
 And she's like, "Oh, no husband, fresh out."

447
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:21,200
 And then Jesus is not toying with her.

448
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,160
 Like, he's not playing with her.

449
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 He's not trying to make her feel ashamed.

450
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,480
 He's trying to give her life.

451
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,680
 And he knows that life goes through the differences.

452
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,460
 And so he says, "You're right in saying,

453
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,340
 "I have no husband.

454
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,540
 "You've had five.

455
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,560
 "And the one you now have is not your husband.

456
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,600
 "What you said is true."

457
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,500
 He is trying to show her love and life

458
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,220
 and satisfy her soul by satisfying everything that she needs.

459
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,140
 And she is bent at this point.

460
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,320
 She did it right the first time.

461
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,520
 She acknowledged the difference,

462
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,800
 but now she is letting the acknowledged difference

463
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,720
 divide them.

464
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,160
 She is not wanting to allow Jesus

465
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,020
 to go where he wants to go.

466
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,240
 But Jesus would not have it.

467
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,500
 So the second point is this,

468
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,640
 right after Jesus' model in the previous nine verses,

469
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
 don't let differences divide us.

470
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
 Do not let differences divide us.

471
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,280
 Differences can divide us.

472
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,560
 You can discuss them or they can divide you.

473
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,380
 They do not have to divide you.

474
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,220
 Look at all the...

475
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,520
 She's gonna run through these divisions

476
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,600
 that she was willing to stop for.

477
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,920
 I'm a man, you're a woman.

478
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,820
 Jesus is like, "That's not a problem today.

479
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,400
 "That's not gonna divide us anymore.

480
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,560
 "I'm a Samaritan, you're a Jewess.

481
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,800
 "That's not gonna divide us today.

482
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,580
 "Hey, the water well, the water well's ours.

483
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,420
 "It's not yours."

484
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,460
 Jesus says, "Okay, you wanna talk water?

485
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,120
 "Let's talk water, real water, living water,

486
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,940
 "satisfying to your soul, water.

487
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,240
 "It's not gonna divide us today.

488
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,440
 "I've been divorced five times.

489
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,920
 "How could that come up?

490
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,880
 "It's not gonna divide me from you.

491
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,480
 "I'm after you."

492
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,740
 He is relentless, Jesus is.

493
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,260
 He will not allow himself to be dissuaded by your past.

494
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,060
 He won't allow himself to be dissuaded by your ethnicity.

495
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,960
 There is nothing about you, your gender, your job,

496
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,740
 your upbringing, your cultural belief.

497
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,140
 There is no condition that can make Jesus get cold feet

498
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,940
 when it comes to his pursuit of you.

499
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,980
 Don't let differences divide us

500
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,100
 'cause that's not what Jesus does with us.

501
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,340
 Unfortunately, we're not good at this either

502
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,520
 because when we see differences,

503
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,260
 we start to make assumptions.

504
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,060
 And assumptions have the ability to divide.

505
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,740
 Here, I'll run a little experiment.

506
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,500
 You can pick on me.

507
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,540
 So if I told you right now that when I was in junior high,

508
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,620
 I lived in deep East Texas down a dirt road

509
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,880
 in a trailer house and my stepdad was a truck driver.

510
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
 (congregation laughing)

511
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,900
 Would you make assumptions?

512
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,260
 What if I told you at that very same time,

513
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,920
 I had a fade haircut

514
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,120
 and I wore all white Air Force Ones to school

515
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,540
 and I had an affinity for 90s rap music

516
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,580
 and I had a poster of Aaliyah on my wall?

517
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,300
 This does not feel like a safe place, guys.

518
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,140
 What's happening?

519
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,520
 (congregation laughing)

520
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,900
 That's all true.

521
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,140
 Every bit of that's true.

522
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,860
 That's a fact, all of it.

523
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,540
 Did you get caught assuming?

524
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,940
 Careful.

525
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
 Don't let differences cause assumption.

526
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,020
 Don't let them cause division.

527
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,420
 You don't know who you're dealing with

528
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,180
 till you know who you're dealing with.

529
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,480
 Don't let differences divide us.

530
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,900
 We're gonna go back to the text one more time

531
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,660
 and I want you to watch really, really closely

532
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,360
 what Jesus does in this next part.

533
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,120
 Don't miss this.

534
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,700
 Verse 19.

535
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,240
 The woman said to him,

536
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,720
 "Sir," which is the most obvious statement of the chapter,

537
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,860
 "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."

538
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,220
 And so what better time

539
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,860
 to pick another religious fight with you?

540
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,760
 Here she comes.

541
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,600
 Verse 20.

542
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,420
 She's laying it on thick.

543
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,900
 "Our fathers, our fathers worshiped on this mountain."

544
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,060
 So now she's got geography thrown in there.

545
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,340
 "But you," that's a plural you, that means you guys.

546
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,860
 "But you people say that in Jerusalem

547
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,780
 "is the place where people ought to worship."

548
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,860
 You see that ethnic, culturally-based priority

549
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,780
 she's got going?

550
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,340
 And Jesus said to her, don't miss this,

551
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,620
 "Woman," he leaves the distinction alone.

552
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,780
 He's not gonna try to change her gender.

553
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,740
 He created her gender,

554
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,100
 so he's not gonna get rid of that.

555
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,580
 "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming

556
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,560
 "when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem

557
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,060
 "will you worship the Father."

558
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,420
 To which she probably would have thought, what do you mean?

559
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,020
 Not on this mountain nor there?

560
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,060
 Everybody knows that either here or there.

561
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,900
 Those are the only argument points in the conversation.

562
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,100
 Where else would we go?

563
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,340
 He says, "You worship what you don't know,

564
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,920
 "but we worship what we know for salvations from the Jews."

565
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,460
 So Jesus is not shy about doing number one,

566
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,420
 which is don't dismiss the differences.

567
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,820
 So he's not afraid to do that.

568
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,260
 He knows she's Samaritan, he knows he's Jewish.

569
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,100
 He knows that she's woman and she knows that he's man,

570
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,220
 and he does not blur the distinction.

571
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,180
 But he's getting ready to say

572
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,620
 that the distinction might be reality,

573
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,720
 but it is not priority.

574
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,340
 Verse 23, "The hour is coming."

575
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,780
 By the way, as if I could build this up anymore,

576
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,420
 this is the most profound word I have ever found

577
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,940
 in the scriptures about race and gender

578
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,500
 and differences in general

579
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,420
 and how they relate to our relationship with God.

580
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,360
 The number one verse that I can think of.

581
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,420
 "But the hour is coming and is now here

582
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,420
 "when true worshipers will worship the Father."

583
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,260
 In Jerusalem, no.

584
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,480
 In Samaria, no.

585
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,340
 "In spirit and truth."

586
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,020
 There is a transcendent way to connect with God.

587
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,580
 There is a way to connect with God

588
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,820
 that goes above and past whatever your skin color

589
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,980
 or gender or past or geographic location

590
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,540
 or politics or anything.

591
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,140
 There's a new way to connect with God,

592
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,820
 and it's not location or culturally conditioned.

593
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,220
 In spirit and in truth.

594
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,420
 "For the Father," listen to this, why?

595
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,520
 'Cause God's looking for people like that.

596
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,340
 "The Father is seeking such people to worship him."

597
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,380
 God is spirit.

598
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,900
 God's not Samaritan or Jewish.

599
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,780
 God is spirit.

600
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,100
 He has no ethnicity.

601
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,260
 He created them all.

602
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,340
 They've all got value,

603
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,820
 every single one of them, just as they are,

604
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,020
 but he doesn't have one.

605
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,620
 God is spirit.

606
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,860
 "And those who worship him,

607
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,860
 therefore you must worship in spirit and truth."

608
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,260
 Now, don't miss this.

609
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,740
 Jesus is not saying,

610
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,420
 "If you're gonna worship God, you can't be you."

611
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,540
 He's saying, "If you're gonna worship God,

612
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,900
 you can't be about you anymore."

613
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,580
 The ethnic distinction, the ethnic pride is out.

614
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,180
 So he looks at this woman right in the face and he says,

615
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,980
 "Hey, here's what you already wanna hear.

616
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
 Anti-Samaritanism is out,

617
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,300
 but you gotta go a step further.

618
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,540
 Samaritan pride is out."

619
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,820
 There is no distinction that can hinder you

620
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,780
 from worshiping God,

621
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,500
 and there's no ethnicity that will help you worship God

622
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,060
 any more than any other, spirit and truth.

623
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,540
 It's not about Jewishness, non-Jewishness.

624
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,660
 It's not about gender anymore.

625
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,260
 It's not about who's divorced and who's not.

626
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,180
 It's not about who's slept with someone and who hasn't.

627
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,100
 There is a higher priority now.

628
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,860
 And so are you ready, woman at the well,

629
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,420
 are you ready to stop thinking like a Samaritan

630
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,220
 and start thinking like a Christian?

631
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,100
 So my third point, and before I say it, let me say this.

632
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,820
 If you don't worship Christ

633
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,580
 more than your own distinctions and differences,

634
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,340
 you will stumble over this next point, predictably.

635
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,260
 If you don't love Jesus Christ

636
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,100
 and the simple designation of being a Christian the most,

637
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,140
 more than anything else that makes you you,

638
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,620
 more than all the things about you that make mama proud,

639
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,940
 more than anything else about you

640
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,580
 that you have or wanna be,

641
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,660
 if you don't love Christ more than that,

642
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,580
 you will stumble over this next point.

643
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,260
 Don't let our differences define us.

644
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,220
 Don't let differences define us.

645
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,820
 What I mean by that is don't let the distinctions,

646
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,220
 which are good and have value,

647
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
 don't let them be your definition.

648
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,300
 Don't let them be your highest identity.

649
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,700
 Don't let your own differences

650
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,580
 and the things that comprise who you are

651
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,500
 take priority over loving Christ,

652
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,260
 or you're not worshiping in spirit and truth anymore.

653
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,380
 What starts to happen is you start to make Jesus

654
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,460
 in your mind look a little bit more like you.

655
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,860
 And when you worship a Jesus that looks like you,

656
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,340
 who you really worshiping, not Jesus, you.

657
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,860
 You've got to lay down what you're really worshiping.

658
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,260
 You've got to lay down the distinctions that make you you,

659
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,940
 not because you got to get rid of them,

660
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,780
 but because you got to value Christ so much by comparison

661
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,300
 that they seem like they're nothing to you.

662
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 That's what Paul meant when he said,

663
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,500
 "I compare everything a loss compared to knowing Christ."

664
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,420
 And so you will always, I want you to hear me very clearly.

665
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,780
 You will always have certain distinctions and differences

666
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,500
 that make you you.

667
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,300
 And there are many ways to divide up the world

668
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,580
 from your clothing size to your tax bracket.

669
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,860
 Some of them are God made and some of them are man made.

670
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,260
 And when you become a Christian,

671
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,140
 you keep all of them except sin, you're still you,

672
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,260
 but you're not about you anymore.

673
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,500
 Spirit and truth that rises above,

674
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,980
 it rises above your cultural conditioning

675
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,060
 and it rises above the kind of face you see

676
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,540
 when you look in the mirror.

677
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,300
 And so like, I don't know what this would look like for you,

678
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,980
 but like there's a host of identities that we all have.

679
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,660
 There's a host of differences or distinctions.

680
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,420
 I'm using all those words to mean the same thing right now.

681
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,940
 There's a whole host of attributes and traits that you have.

682
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,220
 And if you are not ready to line them all up and say,

683
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,540
 "Those are garbage compared to just the simple designation

684
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,620
 of Christian.

685
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,460
 Those are nothing to me compared to simply

686
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,940
 being a Christ follower."

687
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,100
 You are not yet worshiping in spirit and truth.

688
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,220
 And so here, I'll just do mine.

689
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,260
 Here are a few, male, Texan, American, Southerner,

690
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,140
 white, Aggie, church staffer, fiance, husband real soon.

691
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,220
 All that sounds really great.

692
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,420
 I think God created all that, even Aggie.

693
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,940
 And so I think God, I'm just kidding.

694
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,140
 Don't let me lose you.

695
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,660
 I'm just kidding.

696
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,020
 I think God creates all that.

697
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,540
 I think man creates some of that.

698
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,260
 And I think to worship in spirit and truth,

699
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,640
 I don't have to stop having that.

700
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,900
 I gotta stop worshiping that.

701
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,660
 That can't be who I am and who I'm about.

702
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,300
 It's a matter of priority.

703
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,700
 And so all of the things that make you, you,

704
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,940
 they might, maybe you are black, maybe you are Asian,

705
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,300
 maybe you are middle Eastern, maybe you're middle class.

706
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,340
 I don't know what you are.

707
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,100
 I don't know the things that make you, you,

708
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,900
 but my guess is you could list them all out.

709
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,580
 And here's what Jesus is trying to tell you loud and clear.

710
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,380
 Those things may be reality,

711
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,020
 but they are just not priority anymore.

712
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,940
 And so if any one of the things about you

713
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,380
 could be a role that you have,

714
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,060
 could be a personality trait that you have or want,

715
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,260
 but if anything about you and your conception of yourself

716
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,660
 comes higher than simply being connected to God

717
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,620
 through spirit and truth,

718
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,020
 you are not yet with Jesus

719
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,780
 where he is right now in this text.

720
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,380
 So maybe it's not even your ethnicity.

721
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,220
 It could be your job.

722
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,980
 Maybe you love the designation executive,

723
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,260
 doctor, lawyer.

724
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,660
 Maybe a role that you have or want, wife, husband.

725
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,460
 You know?

726
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,620
 Oh Lord, if anyone regards me,

727
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,780
 let it be as a wife one day or as a husband.

728
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,420
 Paul didn't say that, 1 Corinthians 4, 1.

729
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,180
 If anyone regards me, let it be as a servant of Christ.

730
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,700
 Maybe it's a personality trait.

731
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,540
 I don't know.

732
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,220
 Fun, successful, beautiful, hardworking, smart, driven.

733
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
 If anyone regards me,

734
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,660
 let everybody know that I am ambitious.

735
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,580
 If that is on the throne of your heart,

736
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,480
 you do not know what it is to worship in spirit and truth.

737
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,220
 If there is anything about you that you have or want

738
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,980
 more than just Christ,

739
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,700
 you are not worshiping in spirit and truth.

740
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,020
 You are playing a game called this mountain or that mountain

741
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,060
 just like this woman.

742
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,340
 Maybe it's a reputation, self-made man.

743
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,060
 I wanna be a self-made man.

744
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,940
 Well, what's wrong with that?

745
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,220
 Nothing, as long as it comes second to being a Christian.

746
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,140
 What other kind of man would you wanna be?

747
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,700
 How about independent woman?

748
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,300
 You're like, oh, don't go there.

749
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,980
 (congregation laughing)

750
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,860
 What, hey, hang on, I'm serious.

751
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,820
 What other kind of woman would you wanna be?

752
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,660
 Would you wanna be weak and dependent?

753
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,500
 No.

754
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,280
 I'm not saying you lose it.

755
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,620
 I'm saying it loses priority.

756
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,740
 Do you see that?

757
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,540
 Christ is more than that to you.

758
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,040
 You love Christ more than that ideal.

759
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,540
 You love Christ more than that persona.

760
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,540
 And let me tell you why this counts.

761
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,740
 You may be like, hey, what does this have to do

762
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,580
 with deal with differences?

763
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,400
 Now you're talking about me.

764
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,240
 Let me tell you why.

765
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,740
 Because as long as you love something about you

766
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,020
 more than you love Christ,

767
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,440
 you can't love people who aren't like you.

768
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,780
 You have no ability to love people

769
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,460
 if you are in a love affair with your own traits,

770
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,580
 whether it be the way you look

771
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,140
 or whether it be anything from height, weight, appearance,

772
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,060
 skin color, money, some fraternity that you're a part of

773
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,260
 or an employer that you're a part of.

774
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,700
 If you love one of your traits more than you love Christ,

775
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,300
 you can't love somebody who doesn't have that trait.

776
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,780
 It is impossible.

777
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,100
 It is impossible to love with a love from heaven

778
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,740
 if you are obsessed with the particulars of earth.

779
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,380
 There is no way that you can do that.

780
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,820
 It is impossible.

781
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,660
 And people will not understand it.

782
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,500
 I promise.

783
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,900
 I know there are people in here right now

784
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,860
 that don't understand it.

785
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,660
 And I am telling you, when they look at you,

786
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,860
 when someone misunderstands,

787
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,340
 and maybe it's a family member,

788
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,740
 and they tell you that blood runs thicker than water,

789
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,220
 I can tell you from John four

790
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,720
 that blood does not run thicker than living water.

791
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,940
 Nothing does.

792
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,100
 Nothing brings people together.

793
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,420
 Nothing can bring someone together

794
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,540
 like the banner of Christ.

795
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,260
 And we will not gather under it

796
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,120
 if another banner is competing for our affections.

797
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,740
 It will be impossible for us to love people

798
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,540
 who aren't like us.

799
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,860
 If we love something about us more than we love Christ,

800
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,500
 there's no way to love one another

801
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,300
 if you're in love with just the one.

802
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,500
 There's no way.

803
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:48,060
 And so Jesus looks this woman right in the face.

804
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,720
 And he says, listen, you're still you.

805
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,140
 You didn't lose your ethnicity today.

806
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,340
 You'll always be a woman and a Samaritan.

807
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,300
 That's not a bad thing.

808
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,140
 It has value.

809
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,660
 Remember, I created it.

810
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,480
 Don't be more politically correct than God.

811
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,400
 I created you as you are.

812
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,860
 That is who you are.

813
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,780
 I am asking you to fall out of love with that above me

814
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,860
 and worship God in spirit and truth

815
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,300
 because God is seeking people like that.

816
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,340
 And she believed him, guys.

817
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,500
 She believed him.

818
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,220
 And people in that village believed him.

819
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,260
 They bought it.

820
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,540
 They decided, you know what?

821
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,340
 This is always gonna be a Samaritan region,

822
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,700
 at least as long as we're around.

823
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,660
 And we're always gonna be Samaritan people.

824
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,780
 And the people who are men are gonna be men.

825
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,980
 The people who are women are gonna be women.

826
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,180
 And people who have positive personality traits

827
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,020
 are gonna always have those.

828
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
 And some people who have their jobs

829
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,860
 are gonna keep their jobs.

830
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,480
 And other people who have their jobs are gonna leave them.

831
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,660
 But no matter what our distinctions are,

832
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,820
 what we are gonna do is we're gonna let the priority be

833
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,620
 the God who does not have a distinction.

834
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,060
 And so this mountain or that mountain is over.

835
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,200
 And people are in heaven today, today,

836
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,460
 because they were able to hear with this woman

837
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,000
 that it no longer matters what your ethnicity is.

838
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,580
 Not because God didn't make it

839
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,580
 and not because it's not beautiful the way you are,

840
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,140
 but because it is not the object of your worship

841
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,660
 at this point, only Christ, only Christ.

842
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,160
 I'll close by sharing this with you.

843
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,620
 I'm about to pledge my life to a woman,

844
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
 I told you in three weeks.

845
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,220
 And I did not tell you purposefully, but she is black.

846
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,360
 Jamaican to be exact.

847
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,740
 Black did not get a woot, but Jamaican did.

848
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,340
 So. [audience laughing]

849
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,700
 This is the least politically correct night

850
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,580
 at the porch history.

851
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,420
 All right.

852
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,560
 [audience laughing]

853
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,160
 So anyway, I'm gonna marry her in three weeks

854
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,760
 and I'm so excited about that.

855
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,840
 And that difference is not one we found out down the road.

856
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,440
 We knew that one right at the start.

857
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,780
 [audience laughing]

858
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,600
 Yeah.

859
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:55,740
 So I brought it up, I mean, the first few dates,

860
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,940
 not because of race or any difference at all,

861
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,580
 but the first few dates, it was kind of a,

862
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,920
 get to know each other

863
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,980
 and it hadn't really like taken off at this point.

864
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,460
 But about the sixth date, not about,

865
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,060
 I know when it was, it was the sixth date.

866
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,000
 The sixth date, we sit down and I brought it up

867
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,500
 and I said, "Hey, we've got this difference

868
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 and I don't know if you'd noticed, but

869
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,740
 [audience laughing]

870
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,740
 you like lattes and I like cappuccinos

871
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,300
 and I don't see how this deal is gonna work."

872
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,180
 [audience laughing]

873
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,440
 We started to talk about race

874
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,940
 and I wish I could tell you the particulars

875
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,020
 of that conversation to make it more interesting for you.

876
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,580
 But I know this, we talked for a good while,

877
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,260
 just at a restaurant, sitting down,

878
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,880
 about halfway through the meal, we start talking about this.

879
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,620
 And I asked her some questions

880
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,800
 about how she felt about this in our relationship

881
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,100
 and just to explore her heart a little bit myself.

882
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,740
 And it was obvious to me,

883
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,240
 after about half an hour of being with her,

884
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,140
 that she didn't care about anything that she was

885
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,380
 except being a Christian.

886
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,440
 Like there is one priority, Christ.

887
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,740
 That was it, that was on the throne of her heart.

888
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,580
 It was obvious.

889
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,020
 She didn't say it in those words.

890
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,380
 I don't even remember the exact words she said,

891
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,320
 but I know exactly what she communicated to me.

892
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,920
 And it wasn't 'cause I was looking

893
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,720
 and it wasn't 'cause I talked first.

894
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,220
 She loved being a believer in Christ

895
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,500
 more than anything else.

896
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,300
 And that is the day that it became a pursuit for us.

897
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,960
 I held her hand for the first time that night.

898
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,980
 I was certain that she wanted to be a believer in Christ,

899
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,200
 just simply known by that.

900
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,580
 If anyone regards me, let it be as a servant of Christ.

901
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,040
 And guys, she had plenty.

902
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,440
 Here's what I'm trying to tell you.

903
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,320
 She had plenty of distinctions that she could boast about.

904
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
 There was plenty of attributes and traits

905
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,460
 and things about her, her differences.

906
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,280
 They didn't define her.

907
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,060
 Don't let our differences define us.

908
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,500
 She didn't do that.

909
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,820
 And she could have, guys, successful, well-connected,

910
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,160
 beautiful, strong black woman, for sure.

911
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,360
 But that was not her boast.

912
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,940
 Do you see that?

913
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,140
 Christian was who she was.

914
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,100
 And it became a relationship for us that night

915
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,640
 and very soon thereafter.

916
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,840
 She borrowed my attention and she has not given it back.

917
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,940
 Because when people come together,

918
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,280
 when people come together

919
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,120
 underneath a banner of Christ first and nothing else,

920
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,180
 all of a sudden you'll be shocked

921
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,120
 where you had the same agenda

922
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,880
 with people that you never thought.

923
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,560
 I never thought.

924
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,820
 I never thought that that would happen for me.

925
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,460
 And I didn't proactively force.

926
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,500
 You're like, "Oh, it was the Air Force One's thing."

927
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,340
 It was not.

928
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,600
 Like, I didn't, like.

929
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,640
 It was not that.

930
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,300
 Like, I didn't grow up thinking,

931
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,200
 like, I really, really would like an interracial marriage.

932
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,740
 I always knew I was open to it.

933
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,120
 But I didn't want to marry anybody

934
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,140
 who wasn't completely devoted to Christ.

935
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,280
 That's the priority.

936
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,380
 An interracial marriage is not gonna keep me warm at night.

937
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,420
 We're not gonna be in some big fight.

938
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,720
 And I'm like, "Well, she's got a great complexion."

939
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,820
 (audience laughing)

940
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,520
 You gotta be devoted to Christ.

941
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,300
 That's what's attractive.

942
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,400
 That's what wanted.

943
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,700
 All right?

944
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,260
 That's the only thing.

945
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,540
 I never, I never asked her on an additional date

946
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,760
 because I hoped my Christmas card

947
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,140
 would look like a Target ad.

948
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:20,980
 And I hope it does.

949
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,180
 I'm serious.

950
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,880
 I hope it does to the glory of God.

951
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,720
 I hope it does.

952
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,780
 And I've got a whole new host of questions

953
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,880
 I gotta answer and probably ask forgiveness for.

954
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,420
 She's watching over in Fort Worth.

955
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,020
 But I wanna tell you this.

956
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,520
 When you decide that the things that make you you

957
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,160
 are no longer gonna run your agenda,

958
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,400
 and when something goes wrong,

959
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,060
 you aren't gonna run to any banner other than the church.

960
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,660
 When you see some racism break out

961
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,040
 or some sexism break out,

962
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,980
 you don't need to run to your earthly camp.

963
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,780
 You need to run to the church.

964
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,220
 Because we can't love each other.

965
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,640
 The love that's from heaven,

966
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,240
 if we are obsessed with the particulars of earth

967
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,560
 that God's given us and that have value,

968
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,160
 they just don't have top value.

969
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,100
 And so if you're ready to worship God in spirit and truth,

970
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,360
 that will involve not denying who you are

971
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,400
 because God made you who you are,

972
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,860
 but adopting a new top priority

973
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,900
 and a new first designation

974
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,260
 and a new first identity, just Christian.

975
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,200
 Jesus, only Jesus.

976
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,860
 Let me pray for us.

977
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:41,940
 Father in heaven, will you please,

978
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,540
 will you please just do a little bit of the work tonight?

979
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,240
 There is so much work that this planet needs in this area

980
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,920
 because we are in love with the way you made us

981
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,520
 instead of in love with you.

982
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,680
 And so God, will you do just a little bit

983
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,520
 of the work tonight, God?

984
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,920
 Will you do a little bit of the work

985
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,820
 that you did in that village in Samaria

986
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,060
 where you told people,

987
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,720
 "It is no longer this mountain or that mountain

988
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,300
 "or this job or that job or this gender or that gender,

989
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,200
 "but it is simply about spirit and truth

990
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,960
 "that governs it all."

991
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,700
 And so God in heaven,

992
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,940
 will you please allow that in these cities?

993
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,880
 Will you please allow that in this country?

994
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,380
 Will you allow the identity Christ follower

995
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,080
 to be first in our heart,

996
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,720
 not because we're in denial

997
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,320
 and not because we wanna lose the gifts you gave us,

998
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,820
 but because compared to you,

999
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,620
 there's no gift that's as good as the giver.

1000
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,620
 That includes our distinctions.

1001
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:42,360
 Give us, God, a presence

1002
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,560
 to give a simple pursuit towards you,

1003
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,840
 made simple because we have laid down

1004
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,000
 every other thing that we could possibly boast in.

1005
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,500
 And we've said with Paul,

1006
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,640
 "Far be it from me to boast in anything

1007
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,140
 "except the cross of Christ."

1008
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,140
 And we can say with him,

1009
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,840
 "If anyone regards us,

1010
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,420
 "let it be as servants of Christ,

1011
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,720
 "not by any other banner or no other name."

1012
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,160
 Give us that grace, God, in Jesus' name, amen.

1013
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,960
 Amen.

1014
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:20,960
