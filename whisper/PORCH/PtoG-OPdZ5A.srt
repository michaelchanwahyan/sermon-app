00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:21,880
 [APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,840
 Ports, how we doing, baby?

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,320
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,820
 Hey.

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:47,160
 I missed you guys.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,880
 Long break.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,240
 Everybody have a good Christmas.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,600
 Happy New Year.

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,680
 So I want to start with this.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,280
 I was traveling over the break, and so I

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,800
 had went to Las Vegas of all places, OK?

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,920
 It was a mission trip.

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,200
 And so no, it was regarding the book.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
 I was meeting with the publisher there.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,640
 And coming back, I'm on a Southwest flight.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,520
 They don't have assigned seating.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
 And yeah, I love them too, but no assigned seating.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,980
 And so I'm walking through the plane with my luggage,

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,600
 and I'm trying to find a spot.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,160
 But the only thing that's there is middle section,

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,040
 because I was like group seven or something.

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
 And so the only seats available are middle seats.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,040
 And so I go all the way to the end of the plane.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,000
 I make the mistake of putting my luggage up

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
 in the place in the back, because that's all that was

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:41,920
 there.

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
 And then I walked to the front, and there

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,920
 was a middle seat in bulkhead.

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,240
 And I'm 6 foot 7 inches tall, and so I'm like,

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,640
 bulkhead will work.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,000
 But there's two guys there praying diligently

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,480
 that nobody sits there.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,960
 And I'm like, hey, I'm sorry, guys.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,680
 I've got to sit.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,280
 And so I sit down between these two guys.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,520
 One of them is a bigger guy, and the other one, super cool guy.

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,120
 And so I sit down.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,580
 I don't want to invade their space.

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,760
 And I'm like, OK, how are you guys doing?

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,000
 And I'm just kind of riding like this.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,360
 This dude passes out immediately.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,480
 He's snoring.

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,720
 And this guy, he's got the Chelsea boots, the tight jeans,

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,240
 shirt tucked in with the blazer, hair slicked back,

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
 little scruff.

47
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,560
 He's who I want to be.

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,720
 And just looks good.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,760
 Like he's getting cool all over me.

50
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,760
 And so before we leave, we're on the ground.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,760
 And so dude pulls out his phone, and he just starts swiping.

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,960
 Not her, not her, not her, not her, not her.

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,920
 Some of you were doing this before we

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,320
 were worshiping in here.

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,840
 We can track that through the web.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,480
 No, we can't.

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,040
 It's OK.

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,240
 It's OK.

59
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,840
 And so he's swiped.

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,040
 I mean, dude swiped.

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,280
 I mean, he must have gone through 75 girls.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,080
 I'm not even kidding, while they're there.

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,480
 And then we lift off.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,480
 Hey, put your phone on airplane mode.

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
 And then we're up in the air.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,520
 And so I'm still like, dude's snoring.

67
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,920
 And I look over here, and now he's looking at his photos.

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,400
 And I'm trying not to look at his photos with him,

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,440
 but he's like, hold him.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
 He's like, kind of hold him in front of me.

71
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,720
 And so I'm like, you know, glad.

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,800
 And it's-- and like every other one is a naked girl.

73
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
 Yeah.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
 I know none of you have ever done that.

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,440
 Don't do that.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,840
 Here's just free advice.

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,280
 Never send someone a naked picture of yourself, ever,

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
 because it lives out there forever.

79
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,080
 What you go on the internet stays in the world forever.

80
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,960
 Don't do it under any circumstance.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
 I don't care if you're married to him.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
 Don't do it.

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,400
 And so I'm-- of course, I'm like, OK, look away.

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,880
 And now I'm thinking, all right, I've

85
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,200
 got to share the gospel with him.

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,080
 Like, it's going to happen.

87
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,120
 Like, how do you want it?

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,640
 You know, it's coming at you.

89
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
 And so I'm praying.

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,200
 I'm like, Lord, what do I do?

91
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,800
 How do I go?

92
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
 You know?

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,680
 Is it bridge?

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,320
 Is it chair?

95
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,160
 Is it-- you know, what are we going to go with?

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,040
 And so right then, I'm like, OK, I know where I'm going to go.

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,880
 And so I like turn to him, and he like puts his earphones in.

98
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,920
 And I was like, OK, so now I'm like, all right, that's OK.

99
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,000
 Maybe I'll just ask him, hey, do you

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,960
 mind taking those out, because I want

101
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,920
 to talk to you for a second.

102
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,840
 You know?

103
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,920
 And then-- and so now I'm thinking, all right,

104
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,680
 what I want to do?

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,480
 And now we have hours of flight.

106
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,840
 And I'm just thinking, OK, I've got to share the gospel.

107
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,640
 I'm going to grab him in the airport or something, you know?

108
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,080
 And so as we're going down, you know, they come up,

109
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,120
 and they say-- not like crashing, but landing.

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,880
 They come over, and they say, OK, you know,

111
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,760
 we're about to land.

112
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,080
 You know, please prepare for landing.

113
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,840
 And he takes them out.

114
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,640
 And he goes, you know, we'll be in Dallas in 30 minutes.

115
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,280
 I'm like, all right, I've got 30 minutes.

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,480
 I've got 30 minutes with this guy.

117
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,160
 And what you feel like in a moment is you feel like, man,

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,720
 I've got 30 minutes to save this guy.

119
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
 Now, we know that's not true.

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,960
 It's the Holy Spirit.

121
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,120
 But I'm like, I've got 30 minutes to give

122
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,160
 this guy everything I can.

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,920
 All right, you guys are in a series, self-care.

124
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,840
 You guys have--

125
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,240
 I love the way you started the year.

126
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,360
 I feel like I've got 30 minutes with you

127
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,280
 to just share the best advice, the best wisdom that I know.

128
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,480
 And really, what I want to give you

129
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,560
 are seven statements that this ministry has been built on.

130
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,640
 So grab a pen and a piece of paper.

131
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
 It's going to be a little bit different tonight,

132
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,040
 like drinking from a fire hydrant.

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,680
 But write down as fast as you can these seven things.

134
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,560
 These are seven things that this ministry was actually

135
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,640
 built on, seven things that God used.

136
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,880
 And I can say that humbly because none of these

137
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,560
 are my things.

138
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,200
 These are things that I've learned from much wiser people

139
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,120
 than myself, some of whom you're going to hear from later.

140
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,600
 These are just things that I've stolen, all right,

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,240
 that I'm going to give back to you.

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,760
 But it's the best advice that I can give you in the 30 minutes

143
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,640
 that I have.

144
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,080
 And so the first one, are you ready?

145
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,000
 Don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,720
 Now, if you've been running with us long,

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,160
 you've heard some of these things.

148
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,640
 They've come up through the years.

149
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,520
 Don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.

150
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,600
 Here's what that means.

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,320
 If you just do what you want to do,

152
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,640
 you miss out on what God wants you to do.

153
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,400
 That means for the rest of your life,

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,520
 don't just do whatever you want to do.

155
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,160
 Life's not just about doing whatever you feel like,

156
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,680
 all right?

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,720
 I've lacked discipline in my life in seasons.

158
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,400
 And so my family and I, we went through a 40-day fast.

159
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,320
 It's hard.

160
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,080
 We fasted from all sugar, all things sweet, all carbohydrates.

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,720
 It's funny.

162
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,320
 My six-year-old was in class, and they

163
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
 set a cupcake in front of him.

164
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,720
 He told his teacher, he goes, I can't eat that.

165
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
 I'm doing the keto diet.

166
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
 And I was like, buddy, it's a fast, not really a diet.

167
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,760
 Anyways.

168
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,960
 And in those 40 days, just got to experience a closeness

169
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,280
 with the Lord that I wouldn't have experienced

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
 if I hadn't done that.

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,680
 And then after the 40 days, it's so easy

172
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,600
 to slip back into laziness and whatnot.

173
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,440
 And so tomorrow, you might not feel like getting up early

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,560
 and getting in the Word.

175
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
 You may not feel like eating right.

176
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,520
 You may not feel like working out.

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,160
 And you may feel like sleeping with your significant other.

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,400
 You may feel like going back to that website

179
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
 or clicking that hashtag.

180
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,600
 But guess what?

181
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,680
 Life's not about doing whatever you feel like.

182
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,760
 Do hard things.

183
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,720
 It produces godliness.

184
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,600
 Discipline yourself for godliness.

185
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,200
 Like our generation, they're saying about us,

186
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,040
 we change jobs an average of every two years.

187
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,760
 You know what that means?

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,640
 We never get great at anything.

189
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,920
 We jump into something.

190
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,120
 And then when it gets difficult, we

191
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,080
 don't feel like doing it anymore.

192
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,040
 We jump into something else.

193
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,960
 Then we jump into something else.

194
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,880
 Then we jump into something else.

195
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,280
 Then we jump into something else.

196
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
 All of the sudden, you find us at 45 years of age,

197
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,160
 we haven't mastered anything because we just

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,800
 tried things every two years.

199
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,520
 Don't follow your appetite.

200
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,000
 That's what the scripture tells us.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
 It's Philippians 3.

202
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,960
 It's talking about enemies of the cross of Christ.

203
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,960
 Enemies of the gospel, this is how he describes them.

204
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
 Their destiny is destruction that's held.

205
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,720
 Their god, little g, god is their stomach.

206
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,600
 Then their glory is in their shame.

207
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,520
 Their mind is set on earthly things.

208
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,560
 What does it mean that their god is their stomach?

209
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,040
 What does that mean?

210
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,240
 Think about that for a second.

211
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,360
 Their god is their stomach.

212
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,600
 It means they eat what they're hungry for with no regard.

213
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,360
 If they want it, they take it.

214
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,720
 And who are they?

215
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,840
 Enemies of the cross of Christ.

216
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,200
 Don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.

217
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,480
 One thing that will help you with this

218
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,400
 is who you hang around with.

219
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
 So number two is change your playmates in your playground.

220
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,320
 Change your playmates in your playground.

221
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,440
 This is the number one advice that I

222
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,160
 have given throughout the years outside of the gospel

223
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,560
 when someone comes to me and they

224
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,640
 want to change their life.

225
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,320
 In fact, just yesterday, I'm talking

226
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,680
 to a couple who's going through a challenge in their marriage.

227
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,160
 And they're like, what do we do?

228
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,200
 And I'm like, you guys keep bumping up

229
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
 against the same things.

230
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,480
 You have terrible influences around you.

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,360
 You're going to places that set yourself up for failure.

232
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,800
 Change your playmates in your playground.

233
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,280
 The Proverbs chapter 13, verse 20

234
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,160
 says, "Walk with the wise and become

235
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
 wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm."

236
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,800
 1 Corinthians 15, verse 33 says, "Do not be misled.

237
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,760
 Bad company corrupts good character."

238
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,680
 Guys, you know this.

239
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,800
 Like if you get drunk when you go to the bar,

240
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,760
 stop going to the bar.

241
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,280
 OK?

242
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,320
 If you sleep with him when you go to his apartment,

243
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,240
 or y'all get handsy, or you cross lines, check this out.

244
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,960
 Don't go to his apartment ever.

245
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,520
 Ever.

246
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,040
 OK?

247
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,320
 So change your playmates and your playground.

248
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
 Where you-- I'll just say this.

249
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,080
 Where you go and who you go with,

250
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
 that's half the battle in life.

251
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,040
 You want to change your life?

252
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,080
 Change where you go and who you go with.

253
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,600
 That's going to be half the battle.

254
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,680
 It's no secret.

255
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,160
 I've told this story over and over and over,

256
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,080
 that what God has used more than any other thing in my life

257
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,960
 to take me from perverted, porn addict, womanizer, drug user,

258
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,400
 alcoholic, to pastor, as crazy as that is, was community.

259
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,840
 He placed godly people in my life that I didn't even like.

260
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,440
 I know, you're like, no, they know.

261
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
 They know I didn't like them.

262
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 Some of them are here.

263
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,280
 Today, I love them as much as any human being.

264
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,880
 Because they're brothers.

265
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,560
 They're closer.

266
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
 They're friends that are closer than family.

267
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,520
 God used them to change my life more than anything.

268
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 He's going to do the same.

269
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
 So don't find community that you like.

270
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,520
 Don't look for people that have the same things in common.

271
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,920
 Just find someone who loves Jesus more than you.

272
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,840
 And God will use that.

273
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,920
 Number three, I would say pay close attention

274
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
 to what you pay attention to.

275
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,520
 Pay close attention to what you pay attention to.

276
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,360
 The reality is everything you do is

277
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,600
 going to be in your mind.

278
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
 The reality is everything that you

279
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,680
 do for the rest of your life will start in your mind.

280
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,880
 Your thoughts.

281
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,200
 Your mood.

282
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,800
 You're sad.

283
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,360
 You're mad.

284
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,480
 You're in a bad mood.

285
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,280
 Starts up here.

286
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,440
 It all comes from the thoughts that you feed.

287
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,040
 This is so true.

288
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,520
 Your mind is a container.

289
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,600
 And that container, the contents of that container

290
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,080
 can be rotten or life-giving.

291
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 And this is an area where I will tell you that science is

292
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,600
 catching up to theology.

293
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,440
 So just the other day, a couple of weeks ago,

294
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,120
 Jimmy Fallon led the country in a one-minute meditation.

295
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,280
 Some of you guys have meditation apps on your phone.

296
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,920
 Buzzwords like meditation or headspace or mindfulness.

297
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,200
 These are common ideas in our generation.

298
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,680
 This is something where we really, really, really

299
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,280
 get it right.

300
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,280
 But it's something that God said thousands of years ago

301
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,360
 that we would start our days by meditating on his word,

302
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,520
 filling our minds with the things of God,

303
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,480
 fixing our minds on the things not of this world,

304
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,720
 but of his world.

305
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,080
 Colossians 3, verse 2 says, "Set your minds

306
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,000
 on the things above, not on earthly things."

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,040
 And so you need to pay attention to what you're

308
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
 paying attention to.

309
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,640
 If you're thinking, man, wow, she's hot,

310
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,920
 or why don't I have that, or I wish I had her boyfriend,

311
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,720
 or I don't know why I can't go there,

312
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,200
 or my boss, or the president, la, la, la.

313
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,080
 As you're saying these things, as you're

314
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,700
 feeding your mind these things, you're

315
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,360
 affecting your entire body, your livelihood.

316
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,920
 This is why the scripture says, "Do not conform,"

317
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,000
 it's Romans 12, 2, "Do not conform any longer

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,760
 to the patterns of this world, but be transformed,

319
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,840
 be different, be renewed by the renewing of your mind."

320
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
 And you want to know God's will is?

321
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,040
 It says, "Then you will be able to test and approve

322
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,720
 what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will."

323
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,060
 The battles, if you look in history over wars

324
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,660
 that have been fought, battles that have been fought,

325
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,900
 they've been fought over real estate, territory, nations.

326
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,500
 There is a battle right now being fought over your mind.

327
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,780
 It is a supernatural, spiritual battle.

328
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,780
 The enemy, Satan, he wants your mind, he wants your thoughts,

329
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,740
 he wants your thoughts, and he wants to fill it

330
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:08,220
 with envy and wrath and jealousy and judgment

331
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,260
 so that he can ruin your entire life.

332
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,940
 So he wants your ruin.

333
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,820
 And the scripture commands us over and over and over

334
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,060
 to renew our minds, to think about whatever's true,

335
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,740
 whatever's pure, whatever's right, whatever's lovely,

336
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,180
 whatever's honorable, if anything is admirable,

337
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
 excellent, or praiseworthy, that we would think

338
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,820
 about these things, it's Philippians 4.8.

339
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,220
 So fix your mind on Jesus.

340
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,620
 Set your mind on the things above.

341
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,140
 And just like your mind is a container, so is your heart.

342
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,260
 Number four, don't follow your heart, inform your heart.

343
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,460
 Don't follow your heart, inform your heart.

344
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,300
 This comes from Proverbs 4.23.

345
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,700
 It says, "Above all else, guard your heart,

346
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,260
 for it is the wellspring of life."

347
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,300
 Your version of Bible may say,

348
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,220
 "Keep your heart with all diligence."

349
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,780
 That word keep there, what it means,

350
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,420
 it's like the way you keep food in the refrigerator

351
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,300
 from going bad, from spoiling.

352
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,340
 Keep your heart from spoiling.

353
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,300
 The way you keep it from spoiling

354
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,980
 is you be very careful with what you let in.

355
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,180
 And I know I sound like your mom or your grandma right now

356
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,860
 when I talk about music and movies and magazines

357
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,660
 and things you read, but there's truth to that.

358
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,540
 And again, science is catching up.

359
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,100
 And it's like all of a sudden, you're like,

360
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
 you know, a girl's like, "Man, I just don't want,

361
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,820
 I'm just not attracted to good guys."

362
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,980
 That's because you've gone through a university

363
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,700
 that has trained you not to be attracted to good guys

364
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,360
 by what you've used to entertain yourself.

365
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,180
 You start listening, like start looking

366
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,740
 at the words of that song.

367
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,940
 And you're like, "Why do guys just wanna use me to hook up?"

368
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,660
 Focus on what you're watching.

369
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,940
 Think about what you're feeding your heart.

370
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
 It's like a bloodhound.

371
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,220
 You've trained it to look for those things.

372
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,600
 And you're like, "He's awesome, and he makes great money,

373
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,400
 and he looks good, but should I date him?"

374
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,300
 You gotta inform your heart, right?

375
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,160
 It's in Corinthians 6, 14.

376
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,580
 Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.

377
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,800
 You wanna tell your heart where to go.

378
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,080
 One time my daughter, Presley, and I, we were traveling.

379
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,800
 I was traveling for a speaking deal.

380
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,960
 I took her with me, and we got in the rental car.

381
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,920
 And because I didn't know where I was going,

382
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
 we were actually in DC, and I wanted to go see

383
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
 the monuments and whatnot.

384
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,960
 I got a rental car with a GPS, and as I get in it,

385
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,320
 I began to follow the GPS.

386
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
 And I'm thinking that we're going to the Abraham,

387
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,800
 I'm sorry, the Abraham, the Lincoln Memorial.

388
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,200
 And as we're driving, I realized at some point

389
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,440
 that we've traveled 20 miles the wrong direction

390
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,000
 because I never put the destination in the GPS.

391
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,960
 It was the person who had the car before me.

392
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,920
 I was still going wherever they wanted to go.

393
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,320
 You wouldn't follow a GPS that you haven't entered

394
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,460
 in the destination, you haven't told it where to go.

395
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,320
 Likewise, don't follow your heart until you've informed it,

396
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,560
 until you've told it what to look for.

397
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
 Hey, I want to find this kind of man.

398
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,880
 I want to find this kind of woman.

399
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,480
 I want to surround myself with these kinds of people.

400
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,640
 A sign of immaturity is when someone's feelings

401
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,960
 define their reality.

402
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,400
 It's a sign of immaturity.

403
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,360
 A sign of maturity, right,

404
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,400
 is when you learn to test your feelings.

405
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,320
 As my friend has said many times,

406
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,320
 feelings are real, but not always reliable.

407
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,260
 Meaning you can't always trust them.

408
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,060
 You want to make sure you fed that heart

409
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,080
 before you follow it, that you've told it where to go.

410
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,920
 And so if you're telling it where to go

411
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,520
 with The Bachelor or romantic comedies or pornography,

412
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,200
 it's going to lead you to a cliff, to a dead end,

413
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
 to breakup after breakup after heartbreak after heartbreak.

414
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,640
 And the reason this all matters

415
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,280
 is because who you belong to.

416
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,740
 And that's number five,

417
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,300
 whose you are is more important than who you are.

418
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:16,240
 Whose you are is more important than who you are.

419
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,680
 Yesterday my family and I were in ATB.

420
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,920
 It was a new grocery store to us.

421
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,400
 And it was huge.

422
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 And my six year old, I looked up and I couldn't find him.

423
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,820
 I didn't know where he was.

424
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,800
 Monica's like, "Where's Weston?"

425
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,860
 I was like, "Oh."

426
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,880
 She was like, "You had him."

427
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,760
 I was like, "I'm sorry.

428
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,720
 I lost him."

429
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,380
 And so I'm going through the grocery store

430
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,800
 trying to find him.

431
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,520
 And I see that this lady had found him,

432
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,180
 and she was holding him for us, if you will,

433
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,160
 like, "Hey, we'll find your parents."

434
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,080
 When that lady saw that he was lost,

435
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 she noticed he was lost.

436
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,280
 His eyes were filling with tears.

437
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,480
 You know when you're lost in the grocery store,

438
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,720
 it's like you're never going to see your parents again.

439
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,040
 I don't know why that is,

440
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,200
 but he's just like, "I'm done.

441
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
 I'm going to the orphanage."

442
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,180
 (congregation laughing)

443
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,800
 And so I come to him.

444
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
 And when she found him, what she didn't ask is,

445
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,400
 "Who are you?"

446
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,020
 She asked, "Who's your mom and dad?

447
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,760
 Who are your parents?

448
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,120
 Who do you belong to?"

449
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,940
 And friends, for the rest of your life,

450
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,240
 there's going to be seasons where you find yourself lost.

451
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,600
 You're like, "How did I get here?"

452
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 And in that moment, don't be focused on who are you.

453
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,840
 You focus on whose are you.

454
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,320
 That's the way to be found.

455
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,920
 Who do you belong to?

456
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,920
 And what this means is you can stop trying so hard

457
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,240
 to make a name for yourself and to build a kingdom

458
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,640
 because you're the son and daughter to a king.

459
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
 It's who you are.

460
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,020
 You're his.

461
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,560
 That's the most important thing about you

462
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,400
 is that you are a child of God.

463
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,000
 It's 1 John 1, verse 12.

464
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,020
 Yet all who did receive Jesus,

465
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,880
 to those who believed in his name,

466
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,540
 he gave the right to become children of God.

467
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,880
 You're a prince, you're a princess.

468
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,340
 You belong to God.

469
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,800
 You're not just somebody, you belong to somebody.

470
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,780
 You're not just somebody, you're somebodies.

471
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,060
 With a capital S, the creator of the heavens and the earth.

472
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,640
 And can we talk about why this matters for a second?

473
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,000
 Because what you do with your life matters.

474
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
 What that guy on that airplane does with his life matters.

475
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,840
 What he does with God's daughters matter.

476
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,020
 It matters to God, it matters to their dad,

477
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,780
 their capital F, father.

478
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,200
 It matters.

479
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,020
 1 Corinthians 6, 18 through 20,

480
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,940
 says flee sexual immorality.

481
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,100
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body,

482
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,500
 but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.

483
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,460
 It says this, do you not know, porch?

484
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,260
 Do you not know that your body is a temple

485
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,820
 of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

486
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,680
 whom you've received from God?

487
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,180
 You are not your own.

488
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,940
 Let me say it again, you are not your own.

489
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,480
 You've been purchased, bought by a price.

490
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,360
 Therefore, honor God with your body.

491
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,040
 So you're his.

492
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,620
 The other day I was staying at a friend's house.

493
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,960
 They were out of town and I stayed at their place.

494
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,600
 And as I was leaving, you know,

495
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,940
 I made sure to make the bed just the way that it was

496
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,900
 and put everything up and do the dishes

497
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
 and put them back in the cabinet.

498
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,380
 In fact, I was leaving, I was driving down the road,

499
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,340
 they live down this long road,

500
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,940
 I was driving down the long road

501
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,860
 and I was like, man, did I, you know, I had started a fire.

502
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,020
 Like, did I turn the gas off?

503
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,760
 I mean, I know I did, I checked it three times,

504
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,900
 but I'm gonna go back one more time.

505
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,380
 Oh, I cooked eggs that morning.

506
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,220
 Did I turn the stove?

507
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,240
 I know I did, but let me go check one more time.

508
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,080
 You know why?

509
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,760
 Because it's not my house.

510
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,780
 It belongs to somebody else.

511
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,980
 And I wanna leave it better than I found it.

512
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,620
 This ain't your house, man.

513
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,080
 This ain't your house.

514
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,020
 Yours.

515
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,320
 This ain't either, by the way, but yours.

516
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,140
 Yours.

517
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,180
 You got it on loan.

518
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,300
 Make sure you leave it better than you found it.

519
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,260
 Young men, young man,

520
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,220
 you hang out with her.

521
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,720
 Make sure you leave her better than you found her.

522
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,720
 Terrifying verses in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse six,

523
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,420
 it says that God is the avenger of these things.

524
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,860
 Man is sobering.

525
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,800
 God is the avenger of these things.

526
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,840
 And so I don't want you to leave here and just try harder.

527
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,880
 Do more.

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
 Grab the bootstraps.

529
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,360
 Like, that's not, we're looking for surrender.

530
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,960
 A really, a posturing of I can't, but you can.

531
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,360
 May I become less, you become greater.

532
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,400
 The way that I've said it through the years here,

533
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,620
 the way that I've heard it said,

534
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,140
 if dependence is the goal,

535
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,660
 then weakness is the advantage, that's number six.

536
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,820
 If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.

537
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,560
 See, the world is gonna try to tell you

538
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,980
 that you need to be a bigger, better version of you,

539
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,100
 that you need to roar and get out there and get yours

540
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,460
 and make a name for yourself and hurry, hurry, hurry

541
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,220
 and save a bunch of money and retire

542
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,940
 and count seashells and whatnot.

543
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,580
 It's going to tell you that you don't need anybody else.

544
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,940
 And I want you to know that that's not the gospel.

545
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,020
 The gospel says that you're a sheep

546
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,400
 in desperate need of a shepherd,

547
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,100
 that you need someone to take care of you

548
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,460
 and that you don't have to boast in your strength,

549
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,500
 that you can boast in your weakness

550
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,080
 because when you boast in your weakness,

551
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,100
 it gives glory and points to God.

552
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,460
 When you begin to talk about what he's delivered you from,

553
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,280
 when you're like,

554
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,380
 I'm never gonna talk about that abortion,

555
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,980
 you begin to start to talk about that abortion

556
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,560
 and he sees freedom from that abortion,

557
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,500
 you begin to repent from your sins and speak them out.

558
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,460
 He takes your mess and makes it your message.

559
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,800
 And as he makes it your message

560
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,260
 and you continue to communicate it,

561
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,780
 he makes it your ministry

562
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,300
 and he grows a ministry around you.

563
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,140
 And all of a sudden,

564
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,020
 what the enemy, you went to use for evil,

565
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,360
 God, the creator who loves you is using for good.

566
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,400
 It's like he's given you a key

567
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,920
 and you're taking that key, which is your story,

568
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,280
 and you're unlocking the cells of other people

569
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,440
 sitting in those prisons that you sat in.

570
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,440
 You have power, authority, it says in the scripture,

571
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,940
 to help other people find freedom.

572
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,040
 What else are you gonna give your life to?

573
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,300
 What else you wanna do with your life?

574
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,980
 Why, why wouldn't you do that?

575
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,640
 First Corinthians 12, verse nine,

576
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
 where Paul is talking about the thorn in his flesh,

577
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
 he said, "But God said to me,

578
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,040
 "my grace is sufficient for you.

579
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,560
 "My power is made perfect in weakness."

580
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,220
 So Paul says, "Therefore, I will boast

581
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,380
 "all the more gladly about my weakness

582
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,660
 "so that Christ's power may rest on me."

583
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:26,860
 If you wanna know how dependent you are,

584
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,500
 there's a really simple test I can give you.

585
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,360
 How much did you pray today?

586
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,080
 How much time and energy and effort

587
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,080
 did you spend in prayer with the Father today?

588
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,780
 And this will directly tell you your dependence level,

589
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,180
 at least today.

590
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,680
 And if you're like, man, I didn't pray a whole lot today.

591
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,220
 I didn't spend a lot of intentional time in prayer today.

592
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,620
 And some of you are like thinking right now,

593
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,540
 like, wow, man, since I woke up to right now,

594
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,100
 I didn't pray one single time today.

595
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,960
 And I would just tell you, you're not dependent on God.

596
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,160
 And see, Jesus, his whole job description,

597
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,780
 his criteria, what he does, he's a savior.

598
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,980
 He saves people.

599
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,980
 To save people, there has to be somebody who needs saving.

600
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,740
 And so if you're like, I'm gonna get to God

601
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,460
 because of what I've done or because of who I am

602
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,420
 or because I tried hard or by my efforts,

603
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,460
 because I'm good, then you don't need saving.

604
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,100
 The gospel, you getting saved,

605
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,720
 like you getting into heaven to be with God forever

606
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,020
 starts with you saying, you know what?

607
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,140
 I need saving.

608
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,580
 I can't do it on my own.

609
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,180
 I keep bumping my head up against the same wall,

610
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,580
 making the same mistakes, doing the same sins,

611
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,340
 like a dog to his vomit.

612
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,260
 I keep going to that which is disgusting and impure

613
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,900
 and a mockery of who God is.

614
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,060
 I need someone to save me, to reach into the miry pit

615
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,160
 and set me on the cornerstone.

616
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,300
 That is what I need.

617
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,220
 You know what you need to get to heaven?

618
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,060
 Need.

619
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:05,260
 What you need most to come to God is need.

620
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,660
 To be in a place where you need him, dependence.

621
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,340
 And how fast you are and how smart you are

622
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,500
 and how good looking you are and how gifted you are,

623
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,220
 that's not gonna help you.

624
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,820
 But when you realize your desperate need for a savior,

625
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,340
 that's going to help you.

626
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,060
 And so how do you know if you've done that?

627
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:35,920
 Number seven, your behavior follows your belief.

628
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,840
 Your behavior follows your belief.

629
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:52,480
 Like some of you, you've said that you trusted in Christ.

630
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,300
 Just like me, you've said that you believe in Jesus.

631
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,980
 You've said those words.

632
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,780
 But today in your life, if you were honest,

633
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,680
 you know you're not trusting in Jesus.

634
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,580
 You know you didn't trust in Jesus today.

635
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,940
 You know what that guy told me on the plane

636
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,900
 when I engaged him?

637
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,400
 Began to share the gospel.

638
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,080
 He said, "Oh, no, no, I believe in Jesus."

639
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,420
 I said, "Well, what do you believe about Jesus?"

640
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,420
 Even the demons believe in shudder.

641
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,560
 What do you believe?

642
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,300
 I can say, "Oh, look, here's a chair.

643
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,820
 "I believe there's a chair.

644
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
 "Look, there's a chair.

645
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,500
 "I believe it's there.

646
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,320
 "Will it hold you?"

647
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,480
 "Yeah, I believe it will hold me.

648
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,980
 "Why don't you sit down in it?"

649
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
 Nah.

650
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,740
 "No, no, go ahead and sit down in it."

651
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,780
 Nah, I don't want to.

652
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,620
 I don't want to.

653
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,520
 No, no, I mean, do you trust it would hold you?

654
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,840
 Yeah, I trust it would hold me.

655
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,680
 Sit down in it.

656
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,780
 Nah, I'm good.

657
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,740
 I'll just stand.

658
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,800
 I'm fine with standing.

659
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,580
 See, I can see the chair.

660
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,020
 I can acknowledge the chair.

661
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,380
 I can speak the word.

662
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,500
 The chair is there.

663
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,400
 The chair is there.

664
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,980
 I can say that out loud.

665
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,960
 I can even say, "I'm a chair follower.

666
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,920
 "I follow the chair.

667
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,560
 "Everywhere the chair goes, look at me.

668
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,380
 "I'm chair follower."

669
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,220
 But until I trust the chair to hold me,

670
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,620
 that is evidence of me believing.

671
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,860
 It's like, "Come over here."

672
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,900
 And I put my weight, and it supports me.

673
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,860
 My life is in it.

674
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,320
 Right?

675
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,320
 Now, this is evidence of the knowledge that I spoke,

676
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,600
 the reality that I said, "There was a chair here."

677
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,440
 Now, I'm trusting in the chair.

678
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,520
 My life is in the chair.

679
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,500
 This is what Jesus wants from you.

680
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,840
 This is what he wants from you,

681
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,360
 that you would trust in his death and the resurrection,

682
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,840
 his death and resurrection as a payment for your sins,

683
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,740
 securing you to God's kingdom,

684
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,620
 that you're gonna be there forever and ever.

685
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,780
 And when you know you're gonna be there forever and ever,

686
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,180
 then you begin to live this life here

687
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
 as though that's what matters most.

688
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,980
 Like every minute, every breath, every heartbeat here,

689
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,460
 as though you're going to be there with God

690
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,780
 forever and ever and ever.

691
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,040
 So eternity with you starts right now

692
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,080
 in the way you have conversations with people,

693
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,860
 the way you date, the way you talk, the way you buy,

694
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,020
 the things you like, your hobbies, how you spend your time.

695
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,720
 It's all his.

696
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:29,540
 James 1 says, "Therefore get rid of all moral filth

697
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,100
 and the evil that is so prevalent

698
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,140
 and humbly accept the word planted in you,

699
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,300
 which can save you.

700
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,660
 Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves,

701
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,020
 but do what it says."

702
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,660
 Do what it says.

703
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,340
 Don't just say you believe in Jesus.

704
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,740
 Do what he says.

705
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,940
 In summary, don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.

706
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,360
 Change your playmates and your playground.

707
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,380
 And pay close attention to what you pay attention to.

708
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,860
 Don't follow your heart and form your heart.

709
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,680
 Whose are you is more important than who are you.

710
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,060
 If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.

711
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,460
 And your behavior follows your belief.

712
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:25,700
 When I left that guy on that plane,

713
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,180
 I thought, man,

714
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,540
 God gave that brother so many talents and so many gifts.

715
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,380
 And the world is affirming everything he is

716
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,580
 and what he's all about.

717
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,780
 And the truth is from an eternal perspective,

718
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,500
 he is completely insignificant.

719
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,260
 He has nothing in eternity.

720
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,460
 He is wasting every breath of his life.

721
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,140
 I wanna juxtapose that with 11 men

722
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
 who Jesus met on the side of a hill.

723
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,040
 See Jesus, when he came here,

724
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,060
 he had one mission to save the world.

725
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,380
 He had a message that he needed to get out there

726
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,580
 and he could have used anybody.

727
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,780
 He could have used toddlers.

728
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,100
 He could have used geriatrics.

729
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,060
 He could have used the elderly.

730
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,860
 You know who he used?

731
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,820
 He chose to use young adults.

732
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,860
 Some people 18 to 35.

733
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,020
 That was his strategy.

734
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,780
 He walks up to them on a hillside, Caesarea Philippi.

735
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,620
 They're standing up there.

736
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,420
 Hey, who do they say I am?

737
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,480
 Some say Jeremiah, others Elijah.

738
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,740
 One of the prophets, I don't know.

739
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,580
 But what about you?

740
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,720
 Who do you say I am?

741
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,200
 Peter speaks up.

742
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,660
 You're the Christ.

743
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,980
 You're the son of the living God.

744
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,620
 He's asking you this question right now.

745
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,580
 Who do you say I am?

746
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,780
 Insert your name right now.

747
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,740
 Daryl, who do you say?

748
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,620
 Michael, who do you say?

749
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,860
 Jennifer, who do you say?

750
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,720
 Kelly, who do you say I am?

751
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,580
 Sarah, who do you say I am?

752
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,780
 The Christ, the son of the living God.

753
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,460
 And Jesus is like, that's right, man.

754
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,960
 And I'm gonna do something

755
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,420
 that nothing's gonna be able to stop.

756
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,220
 I'm gonna build my church

757
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,860
 and the gates of Hades won't be able to overcome it.

758
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,460
 My favorite prophecy in all of the scriptures.

759
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,180
 Because then those guys are like,

760
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,260
 what are you talking about?

761
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,700
 You're gonna build a church?

762
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
 What is a church?

763
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,680
 First of all, and Jesus, I don't know if you've noticed,

764
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,280
 but people don't like you.

765
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,980
 And you're talking about building this unstoppable movement.

766
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,220
 There's only 12 of us

767
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,660
 and not even so sure about Judas over here.

768
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,380
 I mean, think we're playing.

769
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,380
 You might be playing for the other team.

770
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,160
 I mean, they kept screwing it up, right?

771
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,960
 Like in three verses later or just a few verses later,

772
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,940
 Jesus is talking to the same guy who's like,

773
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,100
 you're the Christ, the son of the living God.

774
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,820
 Jesus is like, get behind me, Satan.

775
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,300
 Because he's like, no, you can't do that.

776
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,460
 He's always messing things up.

777
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,540
 Or he denies him to a 12-year-old girl.

778
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,380
 Like, no, I don't know him.

779
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,220
 You know, he's his best friend.

780
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,060
 No, who is that?

781
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,880
 I don't know that guy.

782
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,260
 You know, and he's like,

783
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,040
 they keep messing it up, these guys.

784
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,620
 They were cowards, complete and total cowards.

785
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,760
 But they said that he was the Christ.

786
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,540
 Maybe that's you tonight.

787
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,820
 I believe he's the Christ.

788
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,720
 You go back tomorrow, you're a coward.

789
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,500
 But something happened.

790
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,700
 Something awesome happened.

791
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:25,080
 In Matthew 28, eight chapters later.

792
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,060
 See, what's happening, they saw Jesus on the cross.

793
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,860
 They saw him die.

794
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,060
 They saw him take his last breath.

795
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,740
 They saw him stabbed in the side, the blood run out.

796
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,860
 They saw him show back up now.

797
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,800
 Like they saw the greatest act of all time.

798
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:49,140
 And those guys, they gave their entire life

799
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,100
 to advancing that message.

800
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,620
 Church history tells us that 10 of the 11

801
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,860
 died martyrs' deaths.

802
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,280
 They were crucified, beheaded, crucified upside down,

803
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,380
 stabbed to death.

804
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,420
 One was skinned, his head cut off.

805
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,620
 One was boiled alive and then sent to a prison

806
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,680
 on a remote island, all because they would not deny

807
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,520
 the resurrection.

808
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,500
 These cowards now became courageous.

809
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,560
 And it's not just their death, they gave their life to it.

810
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,400
 Why?

811
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,580
 Because they believed it.

812
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,800
 And if you're here and you believe that Jesus

813
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,540
 is the son of God who died for your sins

814
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,120
 and God raised him from the dead

815
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,700
 and his Holy Spirit lives in you,

816
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,380
 then what are you doing with your life?

817
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,300
 Because those guys that died, that wasn't a tragedy.

818
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,380
 They are heroes.

819
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,500
 They told somebody who told somebody who told somebody

820
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,660
 who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody

821
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,380
 who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody

822
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,040
 who told somebody who told you

823
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,540
 so that you would know who he is.

824
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,500
 That guy on that plane, too cool for school guy,

825
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,620
 that's a tragedy.

826
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,640
 His life is wasted.

827
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,780
 It's a tragedy.

828
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,580
 He's got a lot of girlfriends.

829
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,460
 He's got a lot of naked pictures of those girlfriends.

830
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,560
 And he is a tragedy.

831
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,940
 A tragedy.

832
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,460
 I don't want you to be a tragedy.

833
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,080
 And so here's what we're gonna do.

834
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,380
 It's been amazing to watch this ministry

835
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,580
 grow beyond the walls of not just this building

836
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,820
 or this church or this city,

837
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,100
 but this week I'm gonna get emails from South Africa

838
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,440
 and Australia and London and people all over the world,

839
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,340
 not to mention the United States, Tennessee and Alabama

840
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,940
 and Florida and California and Seattle

841
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,180
 because of what God is doing through you.

842
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,220
 And what we're going to do is we're going to grab

843
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,460
 all of those people from around the world

844
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,180
 and we're going to bring them here Memorial Day.

845
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,280
 And we're going, my friend is leading us in the charge

846
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,340
 of giving them a vision for what the church can be.

847
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,140
 It's the same vision that captured my heart

848
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,140
 here 17 years ago.

849
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,100
 And I don't want you to miss it.

850
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,200
 Would you watch this?

851
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,340
 Watch this.

852
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,620
 You know, there's gotta be more,

853
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,140
 more meaning, more purpose, more life,

854
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,900
 something to do that matters.

855
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,360
 You long for it and it seems like you're so close

856
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,480
 to finding it.

857
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,000
 You've looked everywhere you can think of to find it.

858
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,160
 You've done all the good things to achieve it,

859
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,240
 but you still keep missing it.

860
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,560
 In your heart, you know the answer is Jesus,

861
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,240
 but you're still trying to make that connection.

862
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,640
 You know there's more, you were made for more.

863
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,240
 And there has to be a way to connect your love of Jesus

864
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,320
 and your God given desire to do something great,

865
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,660
 to lead, to change the world.

866
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,840
 Good news is there are others like you.

867
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,220
 Those who are ready to stop simply going to church

868
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,500
 and now ready to be the church.

869
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,500
 Some say the church is irrelevant, fake and outdated.

870
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,580
 We say it's the movement you were made for.

871
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,420
 - Yeah, it is.

872
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,380
 It's what you were made for.

873
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,880
 Hello, Porsche, how we doing?

874
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,220
 (congregation cheering)

875
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,460
 From the very beginning of us pouring in to our friends

876
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,840
 who were young adults in Dallas, Texas,

877
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,600
 and now as JP said, around the world

878
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,480
 and in different locations that every week gather

879
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,720
 like you guys do here to stream and talk about this,

880
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,680
 we've had something at the very front of our minds,

881
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,400
 and that something is this,

882
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,360
 that we would raise a generation that God would move

883
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,560
 in such a way that we would surrender to God

884
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,220
 and then we would change the world

885
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,520
 through the lives of young adults.

886
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,180
 It's what Jesus has always done.

887
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,640
 You guys are in this room and gathering right now

888
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,200
 in this place and meeting in other places,

889
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,640
 but specifically the ones that are here with me in Dallas

890
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,940
 and the ones that are in Fort Worth.

891
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,160
 You guys are gathered in places because when I was your age,

892
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,720
 by the kindness of God, I surrendered to God.

893
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,860
 I started to do these principles that JP talked tonight.

894
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,120
 And I was sick and tired of being underneath a dead,

895
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,240
 feckless human.

896
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,280
 Come and listen to me, show up, shut up, and pay up, church.

897
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,200
 I go, there's nothing in this Americanized version

898
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,780
 of the church that even remotely looks like this,

899
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,520
 gates of hell won't stand against it,

900
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,160
 we're gonna change the world kind of community of friends.

901
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,600
 And so I quit complaining about what I was underneath

902
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,040
 and I started to just undertake what God had for me.

903
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,660
 And me and a bunch of folks your age just started to pray

904
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,360
 that God would take more of our hearts

905
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,640
 and we wouldn't follow our hearts, we'd inform our hearts,

906
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,700
 and we wouldn't just say one thing and do another.

907
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
 We'd be people who believe that Jesus was alive

908
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,900
 and he still wanted to rescue people,

909
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,060
 he still wanted to do something great,

910
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,760
 and we said, Lord, if you're willing, why not with us?

911
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,740
 And then 19 years later, I'm no longer a young adult,

912
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,700
 but we've used our lives and our fortune

913
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,920
 and our sacred honor to invest in people.

914
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,120
 A bunch of us moved as much resources we had

915
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,260
 into putting together locations

916
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,340
 and putting on those locations buildings

917
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,420
 that we could gather people and encourage people

918
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,660
 and equip people, and we prayed that one day,

919
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,220
 room would fill up with a generation that was well behind us

920
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,280
 that they would surrender their hearts to God

921
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,160
 and God would use them to change the world.

922
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,920
 And then we started to gather you guys away

923
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,160
 for two or three days.

924
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
 And we could only fit about 1,200 into a place

925
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,420
 that we gathered you, and in 15 minutes,

926
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,020
 it was filled up with a third of the folks

927
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,540
 who were already in the room with us.

928
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,600
 And we just said, man, this has gotta stop

929
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
 because there's a lot of places around the world

930
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,980
 that don't have something like this,

931
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,180
 and there's a lot of places around the world

932
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,700
 that don't have what I've been experiencing

933
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,580
 with my friends for the last 19 years,

934
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,260
 and we believe you're the generation who can change that.

935
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,000
 And so we just said, you know what we're gonna do?

936
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,340
 We're gonna go and we're gonna take our lives, our fortune,

937
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,780
 and we're gonna invest it in gathering young adults

938
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,260
 from all around the country, all around the world

939
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,100
 at Memorial Day.

940
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,580
 We're not gonna take just 1,200 of 'em

941
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,500
 that we fill out in 15 minutes away on Labor Day.

942
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,820
 We're gonna rent the convention center in Dallas.

943
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,640
 We're gonna invite some amazing friends in with us.

944
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,140
 We're gonna have incredible artists.

945
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,380
 We're gonna have an incredible time,

946
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,460
 and we're gonna be able to invite thousands of our friends.

947
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,600
 Let me just tell you something.

948
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,700
 That means each of you can invite two people

949
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,140
 who live somewhere other than right here

950
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,300
 who don't have what we have every week,

951
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,340
 who don't have great teaching, great fellowship,

952
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,320
 who don't go, I'm not really sure I believe in God yet,

953
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,720
 maybe, for some of you, but if there is a God,

954
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,560
 I wanna learn about him from these people

955
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,800
 because they're not playing, man.

956
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,540
 They're not just trying to get me to come to some meeting.

957
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,700
 They're telling me there's something worth living for.

958
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,020
 This is your moment.

959
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,820
 This is what the plan has been all along,

960
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,680
 and it's time for us to invite other people to the party.

961
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,140
 And Memorial Day weekend,

962
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,700
 we're gonna spend three days together,

963
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,060
 and like I said, we're not gonna try and bait you

964
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,260
 with amazing, tantalizing things right now.

965
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,300
 I'm just gonna tell you something.

966
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,780
 You wanna be surprised and delighted?

967
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,620
 Come on.

968
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,660
 You wanna come and you want to expose your friends

969
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,460
 to what you get every week 'cause this is not about you?

970
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,180
 This is about the opportunity, and the moment is now,

971
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,740
 and a lot of you guys have surrendered to God.

972
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,740
 Let's just say half of you are.

973
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,620
 That means you get to invite four friends,

974
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,980
 folks who went to college with you,

975
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,140
 folks that you work with,

976
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,860
 people you sit next to on planes,

977
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,420
 and it's going to quickly sew up and sell out,

978
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,220
 and so now's the time for you to go

979
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,820
 and bring 'em in so we can build 'em up

980
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,540
 so Jesus can get busy.

981
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,620
 Watch this.

982
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,420
 Planting churches and forming communities like the porch

983
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,340
 all across the world.

984
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,540
 That's what we wanna do.

985
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,620
 The big call coming out of our gathering

986
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,660
 that's gonna happen Memorial Day weekend is not,

987
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,140
 hey, will you go invite four more friends for next year,

988
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,940
 and we'll rent out American Airlines Center,

989
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,100
 and the next year, Jerry World,

990
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,860
 will it be 100,000 of us that will gather?

991
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,820
 Because what we wanna do is after we gather,

992
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,780
 we wanna train, equip, and scatter,

993
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,100
 and we wanna plant communities of Christ followers

994
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,340
 in other cities than the ones we're already in.

995
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,100
 We wanna disciple 'em, some are gonna come live with us.

996
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,820
 We're gonna give 'em an opportunity to be trained

997
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,260
 and live with us and walk with you,

998
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,060
 and then we're gonna send 'em back in smaller clans.

999
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,300
 We're gonna say if you're someplace already

1000
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,420
 where there's a community of Christ followers

1001
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,740
 that are serious about the kind of things

1002
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,740
 we talked about tonight,

1003
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,980
 then let's send you back more strengthened

1004
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,580
 and more ready to partner with them to change the world,

1005
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,340
 and if there's not one, we're gonna help you start one.

1006
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,260
 And the vision from the beginning has been

1007
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,460
 that we're gonna surrender our lives to God,

1008
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:50,700
 and God's gonna do something only he can do.

1009
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,660
 He's gonna use the likes of us to change the world.

1010
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,900
 Listen, this is what God's up to.

1011
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,140
 He's going to do this, and if you wanna jump in with me

1012
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,700
 to make disciples and be disciples

1013
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,020
 and be people who don't just come to something that's cool,

1014
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,420
 but we go, hey, I wanna live for something that's great,

1015
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,260
 then let's go.

1016
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,620
 But this is something we're doing for you.

1017
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,620
 We're not gonna throw something that makes us feel good

1018
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,740
 that in 15 minutes it's safe and it's covered.

1019
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,700
 No, we have risked a lot.

1020
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,420
 We're bringing in friends.

1021
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,700
 We're bringing in folks that are gonna bless you,

1022
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,620
 but you gotta go get your friends and say,

1023
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,260
 hey, man, you know the thing I talk to you about

1024
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,580
 that I do every Tuesday night?

1025
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,660
 We're gonna do something for you.

1026
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,500
 You gotta come.

1027
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,620
 You gotta hang out with me,

1028
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,940
 and it's not gonna be available for long.

1029
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,900
 In fact, next week, in fact, to gather with us,

1030
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,660
 it's gonna get a little bit more expensive.

1031
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,100
 Next Tuesday when you walk in here,

1032
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,540
 it'll be a little bit more expensive.

1033
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,860
 If you invite 10 people,

1034
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,380
 it'll be a little bit more expensive,

1035
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,380
 but you wanna get in on it right now,

1036
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,060
 and what I'm asking you to do is to be prayerful.

1037
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,220
 I'm gonna give you a second, just a moment,

1038
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,340
 just to pray with me.

1039
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,100
 Lord, who are the people that I've been trying to tell 'em?

1040
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,900
 I think there's something about Jesus.

1041
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,380
 I think there's something about really his people,

1042
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,620
 not this thing that we used to be underneath

1043
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,020
 that maybe we grew up around or grew up running from,

1044
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,620
 but there's something about God and Christ

1045
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,460
 that I'm starting to see.

1046
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,280
 Some of you guys have had lives radically change.

1047
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,300
 You found forgiveness, you found healing, you found life,

1048
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,140
 and this is your moment to invite some friends

1049
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,220
 who will come and not just come to an event,

1050
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,140
 but will walk out of there with an opportunity

1051
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,500
 and a clear plan that we're gonna give them

1052
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,260
 to disciple them and to start or strengthen

1053
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,660
 the work of God where they live.

1054
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,960
 That's what we want to do,

1055
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,020
 but we're doing this for you

1056
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,740
 'cause we believe it's your surrender to God.

1057
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,460
 We believe you're ready to change the world,

1058
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,540
 and we're gonna gather people to scatter 'em

1059
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,580
 for the glory of God.

1060
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,900
 Are you ready?

1061
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,980
 Are you ready?

1062
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,520
 All right, I'm telling you,

1063
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,620
 we can only take about 8,000 this first year.

1064
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,540
 That's all we're committed to.

1065
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,720
 I hope, frankly, if you guys,

1066
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,320
 if I have to write a huge check and say,

1067
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,280
 "Take your place back," and we go find a bigger place,

1068
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,380
 make that our problem, all right?

1069
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,820
 But let's just fill the room up.

1070
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,740
 There's nothing worse than having an amazing time

1071
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,180
 and seeing five empty seats and go,

1072
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,260
 "Man, why wasn't my friend here?"

1073
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,860
 Because this would've been amazing to share with them,

1074
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:13,980
 but we're not doing this thing every week for you.

1075
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,900
 We're doing it because God has invited you

1076
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,960
 to do something that's gonna make your life

1077
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,360
 everything you dream that your life is gonna be.

1078
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,620
 The way I say that last point is people say what they think,

1079
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,940
 they do what they believe.

1080
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,580
 You guys say you wanna be the generation

1081
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:29,540
 to change the world.

1082
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,140
 Well, you got a chance to do it,

1083
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,980
 and we're gonna equip and we're gonna inspire.

1084
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,140
 We're gonna bless.

1085
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,380
 We're gonna laugh.

1086
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,280
 We're gonna play.

1087
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,460
 We're gonna serve.

1088
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,800
 We're gonna equip and we're gonna launch,

1089
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,020
 and we're gonna awaken the world

1090
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,860
 to the glory of our God and our King.

1091
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,060
 Let me give you about 30 seconds just to pray.

1092
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,660
 Just say, "God, man, bring to my mind

1093
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,760
 the names of some friends that I work with, folks.

1094
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,660
 I've been telling about this.

1095
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,220
 It's time for me to use and broker my relational capital

1096
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,540
 to say, 'Come and see,' and come hang out with us."

1097
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,920
 There's a generation before us that made some decisions

1098
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,060
 that something's happening here,

1099
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,900
 that raised up a JP and a DMARV

1100
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,260
 and all the other folks that are serving you here

1101
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,180
 so you can be blessed, and it's your turn.

1102
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,980
 Father, would you just bring to mind friends,

1103
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,140
 maybe who are just somewhere who know you already,

1104
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,100
 who just need to be encouraged,

1105
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,940
 that we need to have relationships with

1106
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,420
 so we can strengthen them and we can help them start

1107
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,580
 what you want for them in your city,

1108
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,260
 that we pray would outshine anything

1109
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,580
 that we're experiencing in this thing called the porch,

1110
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,940
 'cause we don't care about the porch.

1111
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,060
 We care deeply about Jesus, and Jesus, I thank you

1112
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,960
 that you care deeply about my friends.

1113
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,100
 And so, will you bring to mind people

1114
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,780
 that don't know you yet, that I should invite them

1115
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,380
 to come and hear about the kindness of God,

1116
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,800
 and would you bring to mind people

1117
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,580
 that just need some encouragement to be strengthened,

1118
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,500
 that are gonna be the leaders

1119
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,500
 of the not just the next generation,

1120
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,620
 but of your work in the world?

1121
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,820
 Lord, speak to my heart.

1122
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,400
 (gentle music)

1123
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:22,060
 Father, I thank you for this room,

1124
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,580
 and I thank you for rooms just like it,

1125
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,460
 spread out right now in little dots

1126
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,940
 in this little region that we're in,

1127
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,940
 but I pray that dots would grow all around the country,

1128
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,540
 not porches, but communities of authentic,

1129
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:39,220
 transformed, Spirit-empowered, surrendered to God,

1130
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,020
 free from the bondage to sin and self,

1131
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,020
 folks who don't worship their stomach,

1132
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,500
 but who have a Savior that has delivered us

1133
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,380
 from a way that seems right to us, but has led to death.

1134
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,620
 Would you use us, this generation,

1135
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,740
 would you use this room and rooms like it,

1136
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,180
 would you use this age group, Lord,

1137
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,740
 to preserve your people and to reach those

1138
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,840
 who right now are staggering to slaughter?

1139
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,060
 Would you let us take advantage

1140
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,920
 of this resource that's being put together,

1141
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,060
 for others to see your kindness, your goodness,

1142
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,660
 the joy and the fun we have,

1143
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,140
 not when we're exploiting each other

1144
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,660
 for momentary sexual pleasure,

1145
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,940
 or numbing ourself with alcohol and drugs from pain,

1146
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,100
 but Lord, may we have a party in this city

1147
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,220
 that Dallas itself notes there's something different

1148
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,060
 about these people, there's something better

1149
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,420
 than what Vegas offers here,

1150
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,900
 and these people love each other,

1151
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,540
 and they serve each other, and they say they know a king,

1152
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,740
 and we pray that that kingdom's reign

1153
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,500
 would extend throughout all the earth.

1154
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,860
 Lord, would you bring your people,

1155
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,300
 would you use us to be the ones that invite them?

1156
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,180
 And I pray, Lord, as we now stand before you and sing,

1157
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,740
 the greatness of your renown would spill out of us,

1158
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,020
 and our lives would be the beginning

1159
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,380
 of this next work that you're going to do,

1160
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,900
 and may Jesus alone be the one who is glorified in his name.

1161
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,740
 Amen.
