[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960]   [HEART BEATING]
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:31.920]   [BREATHING HEAVILY]
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400]   [BREATHING HEAVILY]
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.920]   All right.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   Well, we are back in Exhale.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160]   Dallas, it's so good to see you guys tonight.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040]   Hello, Fort Worth, Houston, and listening in
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.320]   from around the country.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.160]   If we've never met before, my name is Garrett.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.480]   And I normally spend my Tuesday nights
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.960]   at the porch in Fort Worth, just about 40 miles west.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.240]   And so it's good to be your guest tonight.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.880]   We're going to be back in the Psalms
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.120]   as well as we continue Exhale.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.520]   And so what I'll do is I'll read a selection of Psalm 51,
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520]   where we'll be.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400]   And then I'll pray one more time.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.000]   And then we'll see what God's got for us in that Psalm
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.480]   together.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.360]   So it says, "Have mercy on me, O God.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.120]   According to your unfailing love,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.720]   according to your great compassion,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.800]   blot out my transgressions.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.160]   Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.600]   For I know my transgressions, and my sin
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.240]   is always before me.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.560]   Against you, you only, have I sinned.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440]   Restore to me the joy of your salvation
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.120]   and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.200]   Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   and sinners will turn back to you."
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.880]   Let's ask God for a little bit of help,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.840]   and we'll go together.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.440]   God, I pray that as we get into your scripture tonight,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.360]   that you would speak so clearly from it.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.800]   We know that you didn't write it in vain.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.320]   You didn't write it so that we wouldn't read it.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.040]   And you didn't write it so that we would read it
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.960]   and not understand it.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.040]   You wrote it so that we would read it,
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.920]   we would understand it,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.640]   and it would transform us from the inside out.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.000]   And so I pray that that's exactly what would happen
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.160]   as we gather tonight.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.600]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.320]   Well again, my name's Garrett,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.720]   and I've been hanging out at Watermark
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.120]   for the last couple of years.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.480]   And I wanna tell you,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.520]   have you ever noticed how shame can be worse
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.480]   than a sin itself?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720]   Like the shame that comes from a failure
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   can be worse than the actual failure itself.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.360]   Let me tell you what I mean.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.000]   When I was brand new here,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.440]   I had just started what was called a residency program,
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.720]   I think internship 2.0 kind of thing.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.040]   And I had begun that here at Watermark.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.320]   And in the first month, I mean,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.440]   you're coming into that kind of thing,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.400]   and you got all kinds of hopes,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.320]   you got all kinds of dreams,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.760]   and you're looking for the next adventure ahead,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.360]   and it's gonna be so great and all that.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.880]   Well, about a month into that,
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.920]   I end up at one of our elders' homes.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   And so you're like, what's an elder?
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.800]   Someone older than you?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.840]   No, like one of the leaders of the church,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.440]   like one of the leaders of the church,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.040]   like bosses, bosses, bosses, bosses, boss kind of person.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.280]   And so I ended up over there.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.000]   He wasn't there, in fact, we'd hardly met,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.560]   but he had just allowed us to use his backyard
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.400]   and had a pool.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   It was a pretty nice backyard.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.640]   And so I end up over there,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.240]   and some things happened that should not have happened.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.760]   And so like we climbed up on a brick pillar
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.680]   because we decided it would be a good idea
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.520]   to film like a trick basketball shot.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.080]   Why would you do that in a home that you don't own
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.360]   when you have a new job and it's your boss's boss's boss?
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.760]   That's just not a good idea.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.600]   But that's what we did.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.440]   I turned my brain off and we decided to do that.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.400]   And so then what do you know,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.520]   a piece of that brick pillar fell onto the ground and broke.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.360]   And when it did that,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.960]   it was like almost a shatter kind of thing.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.800]   It was pretty bad.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.200]   And so we started to clean it up,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.400]   and finally we did.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.880]   And instead of like communicating
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.400]   that something had gone wrong, you know, like you do,
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   instead of doing that,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   what we did was we just kind of put it back up there,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.840]   like it was gonna be fine.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.480]   And you mean you could just hardly tell,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.280]   it was just like a little bit of a black eye, you know,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.480]   I mean, it was just barely visible.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.760]   Okay, who does that?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.920]   Why would you do that?
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.640]   Extraordinarily not smart.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.000]   And so a few days later, hours later, I should say,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   I get a phone call that he has discovered this
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.640]   and that he would like to meet with me.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.680]   And we set a meeting for four days later.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.240]   It was the worst four days of my life at Watermark,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.120]   of my water life.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.000]   It was the worst four days of my Watermark life.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.080]   It was not good.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.480]   And I was so, we got off the phone,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.080]   and I was physically, I was sweating.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.320]   I was terrified.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.200]   I was so discouraged that I could not,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.040]   I was ashamed of the fact that I hadn't told him.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.280]   Not that I'd broken the brick, that I hadn't told him.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.080]   I mean, who, what nine-year-old doesn't know,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.760]   hey, if you break something, don't surprise people,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.080]   let's communicate, you know, that kind of thing?
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.000]   And so I began four ashamed, miserable days.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.160]   And I'm like seeing my future,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.320]   instead of thinking possibility,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.360]   I'm thinking survival.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm thinking I'm about to get fired.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.160]   Like my days are done.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   Like future conversation is,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.920]   Garrett, how'd you get fired at Watermark?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.280]   I broke the elder's house.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.840]   That's, I'm gonna be the guy who got fired from Watermark
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.080]   because I broke the elder's house.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.600]   That's gonna be the story here.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.080]   And so for four days, I had like a stomach ache.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.360]   I could barely eat and sleep.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.200]   No exaggeration.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.040]   You're like, Garrett, that sounds like a real shame problem.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.320]   Caught me, that's what I'm telling you.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.840]   It was a shame problem.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.200]   And instead, I went into a meeting with him.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.680]   And when I got there, he did not give me a swift firing,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.680]   clearly.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.120]   Instead, we had a conversation, not about failure,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   not about what had actually happened, see.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   But instead we had a conversation
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.200]   about how to respond after failure.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.920]   Because isn't it understood
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.200]   that failure is just kind of part of life?
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.800]   I mean, you either just got out of a failure,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.680]   you're in one now, or you got one around the corner.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.160]   I mean, that's kind of the way human life works.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.000]   I mean, if you're,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.640]   this doesn't change when you become a Christian,
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   by the way.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   I mean, this is like, it's just part of life.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.200]   And what's needed most of the time,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.720]   if you're type A, you're already leaning in.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.560]   If you're a perfectionist,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.160]   you're really dialed in already, right?
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.960]   Because what we need is we don't need failure avoidance.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.920]   That's called perfectionism.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.200]   You'll drive yourself crazy.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.120]   I've tried it.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.360]   What is needed typically, and for all of us at times,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.480]   is a biblical response to failure,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.360]   a biblical response to failure.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.800]   Not where you look out the windshield
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.880]   and try to avoid the next failure,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.160]   but where you look in the rear view mirror
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.000]   and see a failure
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.440]   and know how you're gonna respond on the inside.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440]   That's what's needed.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.160]   And so what I'm gonna do tonight
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.640]   is I'm gonna talk about failure response.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.800]   Not failure avoidance, but failure response.
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.880]   Sin response, mistake response, that kind of thing.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.840]   But I'm gonna narrow it down.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.480]   So before we go in any further,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.320]   I am gonna talk about failure tonight,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.160]   but I'm gonna talk about a particular kind.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.880]   One little particular kind of sin,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.040]   one little particular kind of failure
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.560]   that it just seems to be a little bit harder
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.600]   to rebound after.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.520]   One particular kind of sin
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.280]   that you're probably less likely to bounce back fast after.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.800]   One particular kind of shame
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   that wants to just stick with you,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.760]   that seems to hit you in a little bit of a deeper place.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.400]   There's one particular kind of sin
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.440]   that Bible hero after Bible hero,
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.680]   some of you are named after them, fell into.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.640]   And of this sin, which is no less forgivable
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.440]   than anything else,
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.400]   the scripture still says,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.160]   "All other sins are outside the body.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.720]   "But if you sin sexually,
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.000]   "you sin against your own body."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.880]   It's in a unique class all its own
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.960]   and its ability to create shame inside you.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.160]   That's the way sexual sin works.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.680]   No less forgivable than anything else,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.000]   by God or by other people.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.160]   But all the same, uniquely powerful to create
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.440]   long-lasting, personality-changing,
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.840]   future-demolishing shame.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.800]   Sexual sin can do that.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   Sexual failure can do that.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.720]   So that's what I'm gonna talk about this evening.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.200]   So if you're brand new, welcome to the porch.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.040]   That's where we're going.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.960]   And so that's a big claim, right?
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.160]   I mean, that sexual sin is uniquely powerful to create shame.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160]   Where do I get away with saying that?
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.480]   Well, first, 1 Corinthians 6, 18,
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.480]   which I just shared with you.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.200]   Secondly, experience matches.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.000]   And so I'm working in pastoral ministry.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.640]   What happens is you spend a lot of time
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   in conversations with peers,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.600]   getting to know them and getting to know their walks
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   with God and how they interact with the Bible
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.000]   and spiritual things and all of that.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.400]   And so when you spend significant time
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.280]   in conversation with people,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.440]   you start to notice some trends.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.480]   Here's one trend.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.280]   When someone says, "I've never told anyone this,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   "but I know what's gonna follow."
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.320]   Or when they look down and they're clearly ashamed
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.560]   and they say, "I've never really shared this with anyone
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.040]   "and I can't believe I'm even telling you,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.040]   "but they're not about to tell me
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.480]   "that they stole grapes from the Walmart
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.440]   "when they were five.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.640]   "They're about to tell me something
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.040]   "that they did sexually every time, and I'm no different."
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.000]   Every time someone says, "Hey, I gotta tell you something,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.360]   "man, I'm gonna," and it's clear
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.760]   that shame is ruling the day.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.160]   I know what's gonna follow every time.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.400]   And it's that they've done something sexually
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.240]   that they're ashamed of,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.120]   that's starting to mark their conscience.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.080]   Shame from sexual sin can even make,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.920]   are you ready for this?
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   This is a huge claim.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.520]   Sexual shame can even make a genuine believer in Christ
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.000]   so self-disappointed, so condemned,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.120]   so guilty conscience-ridden
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.640]   that they abandon their own relationship
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.680]   with God altogether.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.960]   So let me ask you a scary question
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.400]   before we get going and get into the scripture.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   Do you think it's possible
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.560]   for a genuine God-fearing, Jesus-following,
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.640]   Christ-exalting young adult in their 20s or 30s
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.320]   with high hopes for making their life all about God,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.440]   is it possible for that person to sin sexually
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.800]   and become so discouraged by it
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.680]   that they spend the rest of their days on earth
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.000]   as a nominal Christian because they are plagued by self-doubt?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.480]   Do you think that's possible?
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.520]   That a genuine Christ-following,
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.440]   how could that be, right?
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.360]   You wouldn't think so,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.280]   but do you think it's possible
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.800]   for a genuine Christ-following, Jesus-loving,
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.880]   God-exalting person to sin sexually
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.040]   and become so self-condemned
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.640]   that they die as a nominal Christian
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.760]   with a Lexus and a lake house
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.160]   because that was second best?
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   You bet that can happen.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.600]   And I don't think it has to happen.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   I don't think it has to happen.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.200]   I don't think the scripture wants it to happen.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.960]   I don't think God wants it to happen.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.880]   And I think Jesus died
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.800]   so that that doesn't have to happen to you.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.240]   And so if you got a guilty conscience, okay,
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.560]   I wanna tell you, I'm talking to all the failures tonight,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.160]   and I'm starting with me, and mine are many and ugly.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.080]   So if you got a guilty conscience tonight,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.400]   I'm not picking a fight with your sexual sin.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.800]   I'm not doing that tonight.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.720]   I'm not here to talk about your illicit sex
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.280]   or your recent porn browsing
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.360]   or the burning desire you have
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.120]   to take the clothes off the person you love.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.360]   I'm not here to talk about the clothes off
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.200]   the person you're dating.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.520]   I'm not here to talk about any of that.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.240]   What I am here to talk about is how to respond
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.480]   to the fact that you're ashamed of those things.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.600]   Because see what shame does
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.400]   is it takes that recent sexual encounter,
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.280]   and it takes that recent porn browsing,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.120]   and it takes that desire
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   that you wouldn't really wanna tell anybody about,
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.280]   and it takes that habit,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.440]   you wouldn't wanna call it an addiction
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.200]   because after all, you could quit any time you want.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.400]   But it takes that little habit that you have,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.000]   and shame steps in and says, you see that?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.080]   You'll never make a Christ follower out of yourself, ever.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.520]   You think you're holy?
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.840]   You're filthy.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.040]   That's what shame does.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.480]   I'm gonna pick a fight with that.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.000]   So here we go, Psalm 51.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.400]   Psalm 51 is a song, and it's a prayer.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.000]   And you wanna know who it's coming from, by the way.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.160]   Anybody remember David?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.720]   So if I said David and,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.160]   you might finish the sentence with David and?
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.640]   Goliath, oh, I heard both of 'em.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.200]   Okay, you might finish it with David and Goliath, right?
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.400]   And so that would be like the high moment.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.440]   That'd be like the peak moment.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.080]   That'd be like where David is the man,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.400]   and everybody is cheering.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.360]   But if I said David and, and you finished it again,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.320]   you might say David and?
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.760]   Bathsheba, yeah, that'd be the valley.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.800]   That'd be the low point.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.160]   And so the Psalm tonight that we're gonna read
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.880]   is the way David prays after that event
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.160]   called David and Bathsheba.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.680]   And so if you don't know what David and Bathsheba is,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.160]   I wanna make sure we're all together tonight.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.640]   David, it was, David is the king of Israel.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.000]   He's like the most celebrated national hero
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.880]   in all of history, for the nation of Israel anyway.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.160]   And he ascends to the highest of heights.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.320]   He did kill Goliath when he was just a teenager,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.560]   rendering him to be a massive hero
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.840]   in the eyes of the people.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.320]   And then when he was actually ruling king,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.480]   he slept with, and by slept with,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.120]   I mean forcibly came onto a woman named Bathsheba
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.760]   who he did see bathing.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.240]   It's not a play on words.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.360]   But a woman who he did see bathing,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.560]   who was named Bathsheba, forced himself upon her,
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.800]   called her to himself, had an affair with her,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   got her pregnant, tried to cover it up.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.600]   And then when it couldn't be covered up,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.720]   had her husband who was away at the battle lines
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.640]   fighting the battle that David should have been fighting,
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.720]   had him killed, okay?
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.400]   So we're talking about adultery and murder.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.640]   That's what David committed.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.040]   The golden boy, the man after God's own heart,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.280]   that's what he did.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.440]   And so let me just pause right there.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.720]   And see, if you're not really a Bible person,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.640]   and you're like, the Bible's boring,
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.600]   let me help you, the Bible's not boring.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.520]   If you read this, the Bible's not boring.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.880]   And so this is David at the pit
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.840]   and the bottom of his sexual sin, the worst.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.800]   You know that guilty conscience thing that keeps happening?
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   That's where he is, and that's what he prays out of.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.200]   And so what we're gonna do is we're gonna see
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.080]   that he prays what is consistent with God's truth.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.640]   Even in this moment,
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.440]   he prays what's consistent with God's truth.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.040]   And so what I want us to do as we go through Psalm 51
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.960]   is to pick out three statements.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.000]   They come in order that will allow us
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.120]   to form a better response to our own sexual sin.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.680]   So here we go, Psalm 51, one.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.560]   Have mercy on me, O God.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.280]   According to your unfailing love,
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.360]   according to your great compassion,
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.920]   blot out my transgressions.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.880]   Just means sin.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.520]   Wash away all my iniquity.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.200]   Same thing.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.400]   Cleanse me from my sin.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.200]   Nothing surprising here, right?
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.560]   Just begging forgiveness.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.560]   And then he says, for I know my transgressions.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.320]   I'll tell you why that's important in just a second.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.880]   For I know my transgressions,
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.080]   and my sin is always before me.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.920]   You hear him?
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.400]   He's got that low light reel going, you know?
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.920]   The moment that seems so enticing,
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.880]   the moment he imagined, the moment that he wanted,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.760]   and then after it became a reality,
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.160]   it was the grossest thing in his mind
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.360]   and he couldn't shake it.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.560]   My sin's always before me.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.840]   But he says just before that, in verse three,
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.320]   he says, I know my transgressions.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.800]   And when he says, I know my transgressions,
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.920]   he doesn't just mean that he's aware
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.200]   in a general sense of the fact that he's a sinner.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.120]   He means that he knows exactly what he's done.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.200]   And more than that,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.920]   he knows that God knows exactly what he's done.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   This is a prayer, right?
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.400]   And so he knows that God knows exactly what he's done.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.680]   Furthermore, the person who came to him,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.240]   the way that he became convinced
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.520]   in his spirit about what he had just done
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.560]   is that a human being actually came to him,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.080]   his name was Nathan, the prophet,
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.200]   came to him and convicted him of his sin,
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.760]   shared with him, hey, this isn't just known
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   by you and God, buddy, sorry.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.520]   The people know, we know.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.240]   And so David, when he says, I know my transgressions,
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.920]   it's more than just, God, I'm a sinner.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.000]   He's saying, God, I know what I've done,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.320]   you know what I've done,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.720]   and the people who are pertinent to this conversation,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.840]   they know exactly what's happened here.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.040]   And so what we need to do is not just say,
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   I know I'm a sinner, we need to say, my sins are known.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.720]   My sins are known.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.480]   And so my first point tonight is that
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.200]   we need to acknowledge our sin fully.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.760]   Phrase is the way you'll see it on the screen.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.080]   Acknowledge your sin fully.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.320]   You got a guilty conscience?
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.360]   You hurt by what you did or what,
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.200]   by what somebody did to you?
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.680]   Acknowledge the sin fully.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.120]   I think that's so powerful
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.160]   because David's not being vague.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.080]   And he's not in denial.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.880]   Isn't that kind of a first fight or flight response
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   whenever we're not happy with ourselves?
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.560]   David doesn't say, oh, this couldn't have been me.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.080]   I was never gonna be this person.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.000]   We're just gonna pretend like that's not part of my story.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.480]   He doesn't do that.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.680]   He's not in denial and he's not being vague.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.120]   Which is more than I can say, and I'll be brave,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.320]   that's more than I can say for most accountability
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.640]   amongst single Christians, honestly.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.960]   That he is completely open, completely known,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.440]   completely explicit and specific about what's going on.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.760]   And he's open to that.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.200]   Let me tell you why I say that.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.680]   Isn't it true that we kind of,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.840]   don't we hide behind our words when it's time to confess?
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.320]   Don't we like, we've created like this whole language
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.520]   around confession of sexual sin
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.760]   that doesn't even mean anything.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.080]   Let me tell you what I mean.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.920]   I fell.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.880]   You're like, you fell down?
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.720]   What do you mean?
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.040]   [congregation laughing]
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.880]   You fell down?
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.720]   Like, where were you walking, man?
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.640]   Like, I don't wanna walk there.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.160]   Oh, I slipped.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.280]   You slipped?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.080]   Like ice was on the ground?
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.920]   Like, what do you mean you slipped?
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.760]   I stumbled.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.480]   Nobody can walk around here, this is weird.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.720]   [congregation laughing]
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.200]   This is the clumsiest community group I have ever seen.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.240]   Somebody needs to help these people.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.080]   Okay.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.120]   All right, I'm just gonna say this,
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.960]   you're all thinking it.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.400]   Since when did I fell become code for I masturbated?
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.240]   That's not what that means.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.840]   If that's what you need to say,
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.440]   that's what you should say.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   Right?
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.480]   Why would we hide behind our words?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.520]   Like, why would we play games with each other?
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.800]   Why would we not acknowledge our sins fully?
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.640]   That's what we see in the scripture
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.720]   all over the place, right?
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.760]   Psalm 51's not enough.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.600]   How about 1 John 1?
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.960]   If we walk in the light, it's he's in the light.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.440]   He's faithful and just to forgive us.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.040]   We have fellowship with one another.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.160]   But if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.320]   The truth's not in us.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.920]   Acknowledge your sin fully, completely.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.960]   Imagine for a second you needed to go to the doctor, okay?
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.080]   You had something wrong with you,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.200]   something really clear.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.240]   You know exactly what it is.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.080]   It's bothering you.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.400]   I mean, you don't go to the doctor on a whim.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.240]   I mean, you gotta have something
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.640]   that you know is bothering you.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.680]   And so you go to the doctor
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.280]   and you go through the whole rigmarole
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.320]   that's involved to actually get to see the guy.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.040]   And you know, you go in, you make an appointment,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.520]   you give the insurance information
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.000]   and every other thing about you
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.440]   that someone could possibly need to know.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.960]   It's like, why am I filling out my dental records
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.000]   when I'm here at an, just, it's weird.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.600]   And so there's so much information
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.760]   that needs to be handed to the doctor.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   And finally, you go through it
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.600]   and you go through three nurses.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.840]   And finally, after 45 minutes, the doctor comes in
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.200]   and you know exactly what's wrong with you.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.640]   And finally, he comes in and he says,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.880]   "Hey, what's wrong?"
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.040]   And you say, "Well, I'm just not doing well."
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.320]   It's like, I gathered, you're in my office.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.080]   Can you be a little more specific?
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.520]   "Well, you know, I'm just, I'm hurting."
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.720]   Okay, how about, can you like, can you show me where?
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.760]   "Well, I don't really wanna glorify it
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.080]   "by talking about it."
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.600]   I mean, so, do you, I mean, do you want help?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   I mean, do you, like, I'm here to help you.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.000]   Do you really want help?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.680]   The answer is, man, if you're talking like that, you don't.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.720]   I promise you don't.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.480]   Here's what you do when you're hurting and you want help.
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.680]   You walk in and you say, "Hey, I've got some lower back pain.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.720]   "It's really aching me, and I've got some nerve pain
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.080]   "because of it that's going down my left leg,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.600]   "so I'm having reduced mobility."
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.400]   And you can put any machine on me you want,
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.760]   X-ray, MRI, I'd rather not pay, but I know I got to
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.360]   'cause I need to get the care that I need.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.520]   And so, I'll point, like, I'll show you the spot.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.840]   I mean, the doctor's going like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.000]   "don't show yet."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.320]   And so, you're like, "Hey, let me show you where it hurts."
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.680]   Okay?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.080]   And so, if you want help, if you want help,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.240]   then you're gonna have to point to where it hurts.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.560]   And so, if you've got a bruised conscience,
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.920]   and I know that's the last thing.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.160]   If you have a bruised conscience, I've walked through this.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.680]   If you have a bruised conscience from sexual sin,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.280]   from a sexual past, the last thing you want
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.480]   is to bring another person in and say, "Hey, look at that."
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   Of course you don't wanna do that.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.360]   It's not, not, not easy, but it's simple,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.400]   and it's necessary, right?
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.560]   Acknowledge your sin fully.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.120]   Let's go back to the text, verse four.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.440]   "Against you, you only have I sinned
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.800]   "and done what is evil in your sight."
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.120]   Which is a little confusing, right?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.960]   Against you only?
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.840]   It feels like you just had an affair with somebody
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.760]   and then killed her husband.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.840]   That feels like you sinned against more people than God.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.960]   And so, when he says, "You only,"
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.360]   he doesn't mean exclusively, right?
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.280]   He means especially.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.440]   This is superlative language, hyperbole, if you will,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.480]   not literal.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.240]   "Against you, you only, especially you, God,
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.160]   "have I sinned and done what's evil in your sight."
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.520]   So you're right in your verdict,
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.800]   and you're justified when you judge.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.760]   God, if you judge me, you're right.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.160]   I don't just feel guilty, I am guilty, God.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.000]   And then he starts to contrast himself with God.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.160]   Do you hear that?
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.600]   "Surely I was sinful at birth."
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.640]   "Sinful from the time my mother conceived me,
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.960]   "yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb."
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.640]   You taught me wisdom in that secret place.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.040]   Meaning, God, you've always been wise.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.880]   I've always been prone to folly, always.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   You made a wisdom available to me from day one.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.120]   I always chose ignorance.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.800]   He's being honest, right?
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.480]   And he's contrasting himself with God,
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.360]   and he realizes there's a huge gap.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.880]   And so he acknowledges it sinfully,
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.440]   and here comes a key transition.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.840]   He starts now to make requests.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.800]   Pay attention with me to what he actually asks for.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.200]   He's gonna make six requests,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.000]   and the sixth one's gonna be a summary
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.800]   of the previous five, verse seven.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.120]   "Cleanse me with hyssop,"
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.480]   which is a branch they use to clean things.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.840]   You can read about it in Leviticus if you want to,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.680]   Leviticus 14.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.360]   "Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.760]   "Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.680]   "Let me hear joy and gladness.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.960]   "Let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.000]   "Hide your face from my sins.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.240]   "Blot out all my iniquity.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.640]   "Create in me."
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.680]   Create in me a pure heart, God.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.040]   Renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.160]   "Do not cast me from your presence,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.920]   "or take your Holy Spirit from me.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.920]   "Restore to me."
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.760]   Here's your summary,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.440]   so if you wanna circle the second statement tonight,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.960]   underneath verse three is verse 12.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.080]   "Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.560]   "Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.200]   "and grant me a willing spirit to sustain me."
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   He says, "Restore to me the joy of your salvation."
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.560]   The word choice is important,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.160]   and the word order is important.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.200]   You know, let's think for a second
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.240]   about what he didn't pray for.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.800]   He never prayed in any of those six petitions,
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.280]   those six requests, those six asks.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.160]   He didn't pray ever for his behavior to be curbed.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.720]   Not one time.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.560]   He did not say,
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.760]   "God, will you please never help,
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.760]   "will you help me to never do that again, God, ever?"
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.320]   It's not a bad prayer, it's just not what he prayed.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.240]   "God, will you please help the direction of my life,
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.440]   "help me not to walk that direction,
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.760]   "help me not to walk that direction."
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.720]   He doesn't pray anything behavioral at all.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.480]   He prays about the internal person.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.720]   Do you see that?
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.160]   He says, "Give me a clean heart,
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.500]   "give me joy and gladness.
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.360]   "Restore to me the joy of your salvation."
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.480]   That really matters,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.640]   because if you spend your whole life with God
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.080]   trying to curb your own behavior
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.900]   and not ever dealing with the desire
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.480]   that's driving the behavior,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.660]   you're gonna drive yourself crazy.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.260]   And it doesn't work, by the way.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:10.940]   And so David doesn't go to God and say,
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.740]   "God, will you please help me to not,
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.220]   "next time I see a woman bathing, God,
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.540]   "will you please help me not have an affair with her
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.380]   "and kill her husband?"
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.860]   Like, got it.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.300]   That's not the kind of things that he's praying.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.320]   He's saying, "God, will you make David,
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.160]   "will you make the man on the outside
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.420]   "match the man on the inside?
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.500]   "Will you make the man on the inside
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.320]   "match the man you want him to be?
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.540]   "Will you create in me, God, a delight?
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.300]   "Will you create in me a delight in your salvation?"
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.340]   And so he doesn't pray for his own behavior to be curbed,
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.500]   he prays that internally he would delight in God
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.580]   because delight is gonna determine direction.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.900]   Belief is going to drive behavior.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.740]   And so he doesn't focus on the latter or the outside,
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.700]   he focuses on the inside.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.700]   "God, will you make me new on the inside?
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.420]   "Because I know the behavior will take care of itself
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.260]   "when you do that.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.980]   "And when you make me new on the inside,
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.700]   "when you give me a right spirit,
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.020]   "when you create in me a clean heart, oh God,
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.660]   "what's gonna happen is I'll look at sin,
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.660]   "I'll look at sin like at it,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.440]   "like it's the disgusting trap that it is.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.640]   "I'll see it for what it is, I'll recognize it.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.100]   "So create in me, God, a clean heart, a pure heart."
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.260]   So that's the first observation
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.820]   from asking for the joy of salvation
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.620]   is he's not asking for behavioral change,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.940]   he's asking for internal change
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.620]   that will then overflow inevitably into behavior.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.620]   And secondly, he doesn't say, look at verse 12,
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.300]   "It doesn't say, 'Restore to me salvation.'"
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   It doesn't say, "God, make me your son again.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.220]   "God, make me your follower again.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.620]   "God, let me back into your family, please, please, please."
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.460]   It doesn't say that.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.940]   He assumes that he still has salvation.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.020]   You see that?
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.940]   He assumes that his relationship with God
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.120]   has not disappeared.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.860]   He assumes that he is still beloved by God
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.140]   and that at some future date,
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.220]   God is gonna preserve him in such a way
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.500]   as to bring him through trial and through judgment
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.220]   and act favorably towards him,
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.380]   even at David's lowest, darkest moment,
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.460]   even after his worst moments
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.220]   that everybody would rather forget.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:17.460]   He is 100% confident that God is still the savior
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.020]   and preserver of his life and always will be.
[00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.160]   "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.100]   "all the days of my life,
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.320]   "and I'll dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.920]   The same guy wrote those words.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.140]   And so he didn't freak out after sin
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.420]   and think that he's not saved.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.300]   That's not what happened.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.140]   Instead, he's confident in the grace of God.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.500]   He's confident that he is trusting God
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.700]   and he knows that God will bring him through.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.340]   So he says, "Instead, restore to me
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.500]   "the joy of your salvation,
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.340]   "not restore to me salvation."
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.160]   What's that mean?
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.900]   It means that after you've sinned sexually,
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.900]   here's a prayer you can take right out of your journal
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.580]   and throw it away and put it in the trash can
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.560]   and never pray it again.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.760]   "God, will you let me be a Christian again?"
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.540]   You never have to pray that.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.180]   If you're a believer in Christ already,
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.540]   you've trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.060]   you know that there's a God in heaven
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.740]   who is really real, he really loves you,
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.980]   he really sent his son to die
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.340]   and pay for all of your sins,
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.780]   sexual and otherwise,
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:14.340]   and that by trusting in him, you can be secure forever.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.100]   Like if you're there and you believe that
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.420]   and then you sin sexually, guess what?
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.980]   You didn't undo.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.620]   You didn't undo what God's done.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.020]   Salvation is God's work and you can't undo it.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.940]   There's nothing you can do to make God love you anymore.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.740]   Nothing you can do to make him love you any less.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.040]   No behavior that you can take.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.980]   If you have trusted in Christ
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:31.980]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.460]   there's not a single thing you can do
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.040]   to take yourself out of his hand.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.060]   David knows that and he prays,
[00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.060]   therefore, out of a relationship with God,
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.900]   not for a relationship with God, out of one.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.020]   That's a huge distinction.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.700]   So the second point tonight,
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.460]   if you're looking for what to do after sexual sin
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.480]   is simply ask for the joy of salvation.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.300]   Ask for the joy of salvation.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.780]   Ask to be delighted.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.660]   Ask God if he'll help you be delighted
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.660]   by the fact that he has never given up on you.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.380]   Ask God to remind you of the fact that he's still for you.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:07.620]   Ask God to remind you of the fact
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.180]   that you're still his child and Christ still died for you
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.140]   and that, by the way, when Christ died,
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.620]   all of your sins were still future
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.020]   and so your future sins aren't gonna mess
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.500]   with anything that he's done for you.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.060]   And so why don't you ask him to remind you of those things
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.580]   and make you happy about it?
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.520]   There's a response.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.380]   And this is where David's nerve gets unbelievable.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.540]   I love this next verse.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.440]   It's my favorite verse in the Psalm.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.660]   I cannot believe the nerve
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.280]   that he comes with right out of this.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.260]   He's just sinned.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.540]   He acknowledges the sin fully.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.580]   He asks for the delight in God and the salvation of God.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.580]   And then in verse 13, he says these words.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.680]   Then I will teach.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.100]   Then I'll teach?
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.380]   Yeah, then I'll teach.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.060]   It's like, wait, don't you mean then you'll humbly beg
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.740]   for the husband of the wife that you stole?
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.300]   Doesn't it mean you'll beg for his boys
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.640]   not to come kill you?
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.300]   I mean, doesn't it mean you'll lay low for a while?
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.660]   No, no, no, that's not what I mean.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.280]   What I mean is then I'll teach, then I'll lead,
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.620]   then I'll talk, then I'll share,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.680]   then I'll continue to do what God wanted me to do all along.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.100]   Then I'll teach.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:21.940]   Let's finish this sentence.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.900]   Then I will teach transgressors your ways
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.340]   so that sinners will turn back to you.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.100]   What a huge idea.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.540]   Then I will teach transgressors your ways.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.340]   You know, transgressors, the ones like me.
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.500]   Then I will teach them your ways so that sinners,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.120]   this is gonna have an effect on other people.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.380]   Do you see that?
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.620]   David is convinced that his story,
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.940]   including the last, most recent, embarrassing chapter
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.220]   is gonna be used by God
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.180]   and that it's gonna come through David's mouth.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.100]   He believes that even the grossest of sins,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.960]   even the most recent, even the most embarrassing,
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.780]   even the dirtiest, everything that's happened to this point,
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.980]   David is convinced that he is still going
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:04.980]   to have his story used by God.
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.820]   He knows it.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.640]   That's why he says,
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.780]   "Then I'll teach transgressors your ways."
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.580]   And then he's confident of the effect of it.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.060]   Other people are gonna be strengthened by it.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.140]   Then other sinners will turn back to you.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:15.980]   That's shocking.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.260]   Imagine if a pastor was found out,
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.740]   that he was, think of a big name pastor, right?
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.000]   And it was found out that he was having
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.500]   an adulterous affair.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.540]   And then in his press release, he said,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.940]   "Yeah, and then in my sermon on Sunday,
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.380]   "I'm gonna talk about."
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.400]   It's like, hey, buddy,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.340]   I don't think you need to be planning your next sermon.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.640]   I think you need to be giving up platforms,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.040]   not trying to hang onto one.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.660]   But for David, he's so convinced of a relationship with God,
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.780]   so convinced of a relationship with God,
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.300]   that whether he's getting to speak to 80 or 8,000,
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.740]   he's gonna tell his story
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.820]   of the way God redeemed his life from the pit,
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.020]   even though there was sin to be acknowledged,
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.380]   God restored to him the joy of salvation,
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.660]   and now I'm gonna talk about that.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.980]   David just does not believe the lies we believe after sin.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.960]   That's what's happening here.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.780]   David does not, you ever heard a lie
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.620]   in your own mind after you've sinned?
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.860]   Let me show you some of them.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.920]   Here's some mourning after shame lies
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.180]   that come into our mind
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.900]   in a Psalm 51 truth to combat it.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.260]   Okay, how about this lie?
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.620]   Number one, religious ritual will get me back to God.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.580]   You ever felt that?
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.640]   Oh, I've sinned, you know, church three times,
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.380]   nine Hail Marys, I'll be all right.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.660]   That's nowhere in Psalm 51.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.580]   Instead, if I'm reading Psalm 51 right,
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.980]   it means God doesn't want sacrifices,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.260]   he wants a humble and lowly spirit,
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.500]   as we'll see in just a moment.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.740]   If you read down, that's what it says,
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.260]   he wants a humble and lowly spirit.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.380]   He doesn't want sacrifices,
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.820]   he doesn't want you to religiously ritual
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.060]   your way back to God.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.060]   How about this one?
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.880]   He's looking for perfection.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.300]   No, he's not, he's looking for devotion.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.740]   I'll go do church like nothing is wrong.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.700]   There's a good idea.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.380]   Don't go do church like nothing's wrong.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.100]   Admit everything is wrong and then ask for help.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.940]   Acknowledge, right?
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.100]   I need to make promises to God.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.020]   You ever felt that way?
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.460]   You wake up, you're like, oh man, okay,
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.700]   what in the world can I tell God
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.660]   to make sure that we're on the same page again?
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.900]   Like he can't hear what you're thinking.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.580]   Like you're gonna have a meeting with yourself
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.740]   and then you're gonna go back to God
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.740]   and y'all are gonna figure it out
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.980]   and you're really gonna give him the sales pitch
[00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.820]   on this one.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.640]   That's not gonna happen.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.680]   (laughing)
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.720]   I need a self-improved heart.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.160]   I need to just go away for a while,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.760]   I'll improve myself and then I'll come back to God.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.480]   No, God wants a broken heart.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.560]   That's what the Psalm says if you look down.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.480]   How about this one?
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.300]   God's done with me.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.480]   You ever heard that one?
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.880]   God's done with you.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.480]   He's done.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.320]   He's done with you.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.140]   This is not the last time.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.280]   The last time was the last time.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.400]   You get no more last times.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   You're done, right?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.240]   He's never gonna ease your guilty conscience.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.900]   He's never gonna ease the earthly consequences of your sin.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.100]   It's just your future's just out there waiting for you
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.760]   like a minefield and you're gonna have to walk through it
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.240]   and it's gonna blow up when you get there.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   God's done with you.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   You ever heard that?
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.360]   David's not convinced of that.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.840]   That's not what Psalm 51 says.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.720]   Instead, it says God's gonna use me.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.860]   Then I'll teach transgressors.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.700]   That's what that means.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.780]   Restore to me the joy of your salvation.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.360]   Then I'm gonna open my mouth from the rooftops
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.760]   and I'm gonna talk about what you've done for me, God.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.120]   He's not buying the lie.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.280]   I hate myself for what I did.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.120]   You ever felt that way?
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.480]   You ever looked at something you didn't wanna look at?
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.600]   Touched something you didn't need to touch?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.520]   And then afterward you feel like,
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.300]   I hate myself for what I did.
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.100]   I cannot believe what I just did.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.040]   I don't even wanna look at me.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.060]   No one else needs to look at me.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.540]   I don't even wanna look at me.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.380]   I hate myself.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.940]   God loves you despite what you just did.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.060]   There's a truth.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.820]   God loves you despite what you just did,
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.740]   whether recent or a decade ago.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.460]   I can't tell people about this.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.820]   Gotta go hush.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.100]   Gotta go quiet.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.300]   I could never tell anybody about this.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.140]   It's too embarrassing.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:39.960]   It's too dark.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.800]   It's too nasty.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.640]   It's too bad.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.460]   It's too, it's too, it's too.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.500]   David doesn't do that.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.340]   He doesn't think that.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.440]   He assumes that after,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.920]   and only after he's acknowledged sin for what it is,
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.060]   and only after God's upheld him with a willing spirit,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.560]   then he'll open his mouth.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.980]   He assumes that he's gonna tell.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.500]   He assumes that.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.340]   Amazing.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.180]   And so what do you do?
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.640]   There's one, two, three, right?
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.060]   It wasn't given to us in one, two, three form.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.580]   This is a poem, right?
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.660]   It's poetry.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.180]   But there's a very clear one, two, three
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.220]   about what to do in response to a plagued conscience
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.340]   because of sexual sin.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.820]   One, acknowledge your sin fully before yourself,
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.020]   before God, and before the appropriate other people.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.780]   Two, ask for the joy of salvation.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.500]   If you don't know what salvation is,
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.460]   if you haven't yet begun a relationship with Christ,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.560]   what that means is, as I explained just a moment ago,
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.980]   it means that believing that there is a God,
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.060]   that he's real, that he loves you,
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.200]   that he sent his son to die,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.300]   to take care of all of the sins in your place
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.540]   that you should have died for,
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.620]   instead dying the death you deserve,
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.900]   and that by faith in him, by faith in him,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.280]   by trust in him alone, you can receive forgiveness
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.500]   and guaranteed salvation,
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.540]   that you can ask for joy in response to.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.780]   Acknowledge your sin fully,
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.340]   then ask for the joy of salvation in your life.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.820]   And then thirdly, allow God to use your story.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.460]   Why wouldn't you allow God to use your story?
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.540]   I know what it's like to hate your story, by the way.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.380]   I used to hate mine.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.260]   And then I realized hating my own story
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.420]   is like looking down at my left hand
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.860]   and hating my own left hand,
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.140]   and thinking, man, I really wish God
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.420]   would've given me another one of those.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.500]   That doesn't work, what a waste of time, right?
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.900]   Instead, David says, in this order,
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.740]   I'm gonna acknowledge sin,
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.340]   I'm gonna ask for the joy of salvation,
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.260]   and then I'm gonna act boldly.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.900]   I'm gonna allow God to use my story.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.900]   Now, if you skip one of those steps,
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.060]   you're gonna wind up in trouble.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.900]   Why?
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.180]   Because if you skip to, oh, I'm just gonna talk,
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.020]   I'm gonna tell my story,
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.040]   and you do that before you acknowledge your sin fully,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.900]   what's gonna happen is, you're gonna be fake
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.140]   and you're gonna be flippant.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.520]   You're gonna be the person who commits serious sin,
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.660]   and then you wake up the next morning,
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.740]   and you go, oh, there's grace for that.
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.660]   Don't be that person, okay?
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.980]   If it's sin, call it sin.
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.140]   Look it in the face, right?
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.500]   And if you skip the second step,
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.020]   ask for the joy of salvation,
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.860]   what's gonna happen is,
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.940]   on the opposite end of the spectrum,
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.700]   if you skip the, God, will you restore
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.620]   a right spirit within me,
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.460]   what's gonna happen is,
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.380]   you're gonna be downtrodden and guilty,
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.940]   and you'll never get out
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.140]   if you don't ask God for the joy of salvation.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.620]   And so then, and only then,
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.320]   to whatever people that God's given you to speak to,
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.100]   tell 'em, tell 'em what God did for you.
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.560]   Tell 'em what God saved you from,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.640]   which, by the way, you can't do
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.440]   unless you talk about where you were.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:23.600]   Tell it, share it, be strengthened.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.440]   Do you know, it says,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.120]   "Then I'll teach transgressors your ways,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.200]   "and sinners will come back to you."
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.000]   Your story, whatever it is,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.400]   it does not matter what it is,
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.600]   and I know the temptation here
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   is to think that you're terminally unique.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.000]   It's like, I'm the only one of my kind in this room.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.840]   Let me help you.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.280]   You're not the only one of your kind in this room.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.200]   And God will use your story, just like the rest,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.080]   to encourage the people to your left and to your right.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.440]   And so, whoever God's given you an audience with,
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.720]   whoever God's given you an audience with, be ready.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.920]   If you've been strengthened
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.480]   by the provision that he's made for you
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.840]   in the cross, in Christ,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.160]   if you've been strengthened by that,
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.360]   and you're ready to acknowledge what he's done for you,
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   which, by the way, entails you acknowledging
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.480]   where you were apart from him,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.560]   if you're ready to do that,
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.960]   why don't you tell some people
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.920]   about what God's done for you
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.220]   so that he can get the praise for what he did?
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.660]   And sinners will come back to him.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.420]   The people around you will respond.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.980]   Let me close by sharing some ways that,
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.500]   one particular way, a key conversation in my life,
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.020]   where this actually happened to me.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.380]   About a year, nearly a year,
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.660]   into working here at Watermark,
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.340]   I was still a resident at the time.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.100]   I was traveling with JP, who,
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.700]   if it's your first night here tonight,
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:33.240]   he directs the porch, and I was traveling with him.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.540]   He was speaking at a Christian camp.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.580]   I was not speaking at the camp.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.820]   I was carrying the bags and trying to tell a joke or two.
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.420]   And so, while we were there,
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.060]   we were just hanging out, and I woke up one morning,
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:48.420]   and I had what Psalm 51, one and two
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.300]   describe in the guilty conscience of a person
[00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.840]   who has just sinned terribly.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.940]   So my own past was pornography, sex, drugs, and alcohol.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.640]   I was exposed to all that before I was 16 years old.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.100]   Went through a porn addiction when I was in college.
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.520]   Partied, all of it.
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.580]   Was creative about it.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.500]   And I woke up one morning while we were at this,
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.380]   we were at this Christian camp,
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.860]   and I woke up one morning, and I looked out the window,
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.300]   and I thought, this is, what am I doing here?
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.780]   Like, why do I belong here?
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.620]   I don't belong here.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.100]   This is a place where God's people
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.260]   come to do God's business.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.020]   I'm not God's man.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.520]   How did I sneak into this?
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.620]   And then JP, I wake up, and I see him over there,
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.820]   and I go, I'm thinking, this guy interviewed me
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.180]   and gave me a shot.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.860]   Like, he gave me a chance.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.420]   Like, he's gonna wonder, like,
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.500]   why I didn't share all this with him in detail,
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.700]   like, when he interviewed me.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.900]   Like, I gotta tell him, like, where I've been,
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.940]   and I know I'm the only one of my,
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.580]   like, I'm convinced at that point,
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:47.660]   I'm the only one of my kind.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.900]   I'm, like, scared for my job, I'm scared for everything.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.740]   Like, God wants me to, like, tell people how to be pure.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.820]   Like, I'm not pure.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.940]   Never have been, right?
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.940]   And so I am scared, legitimately scared.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.420]   I work on a church staff, and I got a terrible past.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.980]   And so I walked up to JP,
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.060]   and I'm sure he saw shame from a mile away.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.100]   I had my chin on my chest, and I was,
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.100]   it was very clear that I did not like being the guy
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.940]   with my story.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.700]   I did not like being the guy who had been where I'd been.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.780]   I said, JP, man, I wanna just share some stuff with you.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.100]   And so I downloaded with him everything
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.200]   that I just downloaded with you in detail.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.860]   And I got done, and I thought for sure
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.060]   that he was gonna look at me like I was from another planet.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.740]   How in the world could I be so messed up?
[00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.100]   How in the world could I have deceived him?
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.180]   How in the world, how in the world?
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.160]   There's no disappointments coming.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.420]   And instead, he said, hey, Garrett, listen,
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.660]   I wanna tell you something.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:46.920]   Don't ever be anybody except the guy with that story.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:51.760]   Don't ever try to be anybody except the guy with that story.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.100]   In fact, I want you to tell it,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:58.460]   and I'll tell you mine, I'll go first.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.260]   I walked away from that meeting,
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.060]   and I felt like I was 10 feet tall.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.180]   I knew that I would never pass on a chance
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.780]   to share my story in full.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.460]   I knew that I was not gonna let shame ruin my life.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.140]   I walked away for the first time,
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.620]   knowing that even though, fully for the first time,
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.780]   that even though there was sin to be acknowledged,
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.120]   and there was shame that had been had,
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.400]   and shame that had been walked through,
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.900]   that I could be confident for the first time
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.900]   in future grace and kindness toward me from God.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:29.460]   And all it took for God to get that message to me
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.140]   was for another person with a past and a story
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.160]   to step in and go first.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.900]   Then I will teach transgressors,
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.220]   and other sinners will come back to you.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.060]   You see how that works?
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.780]   You see how when one person gets strong,
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.700]   you see how when one person is a brokenhearted sinner
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.280]   who's been made glad by the grace of God,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.180]   when they step forward and allow God to use their story,
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.180]   you see what it does to a room of people?
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.380]   And so our vision here, okay,
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.140]   the reason we meet on Tuesday nights,
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.140]   the reason the church gathers,
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.060]   is not so that we can create a city full of people
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.740]   who don't have extramarital sex.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.140]   Dear God, I hope our vision's bigger than that.
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.740]   And if we eliminated extramarital sex,
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.260]   believe me, life would go better,
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.900]   and there'd be less spiritual death in the city.
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.140]   There's no question about it.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.180]   But that's not the key goal.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:25.940]   The goal would be, instead, that we're a group of people
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.780]   that when they're brokenhearted over their own sin,
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.720]   they're bold about it.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.900]   And when they're guilty, they're gutsy about it.
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.260]   And whenever they've got nowhere to turn,
[00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.860]   they turn to the grace of God and they plead.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.700]   I am guilty.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.920]   And they say, God, but you died for me,
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.820]   and I'm confident of your future action
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.700]   in favor of me, not against me.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.540]   And so guess what?
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.980]   Because you've made me so secure,
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.100]   no group of people seeing me as I am
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.360]   could ever make me insecure.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.200]   So guess what?
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.260]   What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna speak
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.940]   exactly what you've done for me.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.820]   I'm gonna be bold when I'm brokenhearted.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.540]   I'll be gutsy when I'm guilty.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.080]   I'll let you use my story.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.140]   I'm not gonna sit there with a secret
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.900]   in church ever again or in any other circle.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.340]   That's over.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.900]   Instead, I'm gonna talk about the way you gave me joy
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.660]   despite the sin that I needed still to acknowledge.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:12.920]   I want you to imagine with me for a second
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.500]   that whenever we are done here tonight,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.720]   that you walk out these doors,
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.900]   or you walk out of the Ridgely Theater
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.740]   if you're in Fort Worth,
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:20.700]   or you put down your iPhone
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.020]   if you're watching somewhere remotely,
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.540]   or you walk out if you're hanging out down there in Houston,
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.380]   and you walk out,
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.500]   and instead of being afraid of your own story
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.340]   and being plagued by sexual guilt
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.820]   that you didn't even know was there,
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.660]   what if instead of that,
[00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.280]   what if you acknowledged everything that you'd ever done
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.700]   before God and before some other trusted person?
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.400]   You begged God to give you the joy,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.380]   this first certainty that he's for you in Christ,
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.940]   and the willingness and the wherewithal to trust him,
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.140]   and then the joy that should come with that.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:49.980]   And then why don't you tell what he's done for you?
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:53.040]   When that happens, this will be a different place.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.320]   This will be a different world.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.160]   That's the truth.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.420]   So that's what we're aiming at.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.700]   And that's what's available to us.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.020]   And if you are willing,
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.900]   if you're willing to go on that journey,
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.380]   and it's a scary one, believe me,
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.300]   if you're willing to go on that journey,
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.500]   you won't just exhale in your relationship with God,
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.660]   you'll talk about it.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.700]   Let's pray that we'd be those people.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.440]   Thank you, God, that you've acted for us
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.980]   and not against us in Christ.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.680]   Thank you, God, that you didn't condemn us
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.020]   when we condemned ourselves.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.940]   Thank you, God, that though there's nothing about us
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.420]   that's lovable, not a single thing about us
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.700]   that's lovable at times, you've bridged the gap.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.140]   You came for us.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.940]   There's no secret, there's no information
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.580]   in any of these rooms that you don't know, not one bit.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.980]   Not the things we wanted, not the things we did.
[00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.620]   Not the fact that there's a section of us here tonight
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.560]   that never behaviorally did these things,
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.580]   and we sit there proud, thinking we're clean.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:55.620]   It's not true either.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.820]   God, will you humble us all before you,
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.020]   and then will you lift us up.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.720]   We don't wanna lift ourselves up.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.700]   We wanna allow you, God, to be the lifter of our head,
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.420]   to get our chin off of our chest,
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.260]   to be strengthened by your salvation and have joy in it.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.980]   And then allow you to use our story.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.980]   In Jesus' name.
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.980]   In Jesus' name.
