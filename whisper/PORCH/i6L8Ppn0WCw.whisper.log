[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:23.900]   - Hey Dallas, it's great to be with you.
[00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.220]   Fort Worth, much love to you from afar
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.760]   and everyone else that's listening in
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.980]   from around the country.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.240]   It's great to be with you tonight.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   I wanna start by asking you a question.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.360]   Has anyone ever heard of Cannacock?
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   Strong response.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.360]   I had never heard of it, I've gotta confess.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.240]   But then I did hear of it when I came around some folks
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.520]   who had been involved there
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.760]   and came to appreciate the place's influence.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.920]   Finally got a chance to go.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.740]   If you don't know what this is,
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.880]   I wanna bring everyone together.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.400]   It's a Christian camp in Branson, Missouri.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.800]   It's a beautiful piece of land and property.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.240]   And I got a chance to go there.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.540]   JP was invited to teach.
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.640]   I got invited to go and hold the bags and open the doors
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.200]   and maybe tell like a joke or two.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.720]   And so we end up there at Cannacock together
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.520]   and he is preaching at a young adults gathering.
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.240]   And so we're there to set the scene.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480]   It's a chapel on the side of a mountain.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.960]   It's absolutely beautiful.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.480]   And so the worship felt great.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.340]   The room, the community felt cozy.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920]   It was probably 70 or 80 guys or girls
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.100]   who all knew each other.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.200]   And afterward, so worship happens,
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.400]   JP teaches, worship song to close, pretty standard fare.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.020]   And then afterward, it kind of starts to break up.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.200]   People start to get into circles and talk.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.320]   And at the end of that, I find myself up near the front,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.960]   near the worship leader, JP and he were talking.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.200]   I found myself not really a key player in the discussion.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.480]   And so I kind of started to back up and look around
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.180]   and I saw the guy's guitar sitting right there on a stand.
[00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.800]   And now I love guitars.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.200]   I'm not good at guitar.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.160]   That's not where this is going.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.960]   There's a reason why I was invited to visit
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.420]   after the worship part was already over tonight.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.880]   But I know how to hold one.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.440]   Like I enjoy it, like it's fun.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.360]   And so I saw an opportunity sitting right there.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.200]   It was also beautiful.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.480]   I didn't really, I wasn't able to appreciate
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.840]   how beautiful at the time.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.920]   And so I, but I asked the question,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.880]   which feels pretty standard amongst guitar players.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.000]   Not that he knew I was one such person,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.440]   but I asked him, "Hey, can I play your guitar?"
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   And he said, "Yes."
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.560]   But it was one of those yeses
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.040]   that didn't really give you a confidence
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.160]   that it was a yes in here.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.080]   You know, it was kind of,
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.200]   there was like some strings attached.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.620]   It was like, "Yeah, sure."
[00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.560]   And even JP kind of, when I asked him,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   he kind of turned his head a little faster
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.920]   than he normally would.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.840]   I was like, "These guys need to loosen up.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.680]   "Give me this thing."
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080]   And so I picked it up,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   thinking I'm gonna demonstrate and just redeem myself.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.520]   And so I start to play it a little bit
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   and I'm really enjoying it.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.960]   I mean, it's beautiful, but,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.280]   and so I'm playing it and they continue to talk,
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.040]   but I still feel like they're watching me a little bit.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.720]   So it's making me more nervous than anything.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.440]   So I'm not really able to enjoy the thing.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   So I put it down and we walk outside.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   And as soon as we walk outside the chapel,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.840]   I look left and JP's right there.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.800]   And I looked at him
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.920]   and as if to say, "What was going on in there?"
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.440]   And before I got a chance to ask that question,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.440]   he said, "That guitar cost $20,000."
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   Well, you should get me two for Christmas then
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.040]   and see if they're that good of a deal.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   So $20,000 was the cost of this guitar.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.400]   And I had no idea about that.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.080]   And some more information starts to kind of come available
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   about the guitars.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.880]   He said, "Yeah, it's made of sunken redwood."
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.980]   And so what that means is it's wood
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.560]   that's been compressed by a creek.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.580]   They literally dig it out from under a creek
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.040]   because wood that's been compressed like that
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.080]   makes a beautiful sound.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.360]   I didn't know any of this.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.780]   And so the guitar is literally a masterpiece,
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.840]   like as in best guitar in the world kind of thing.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.980]   And so I realized in that moment,
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.960]   I hadn't been reckless with the guitar.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.920]   I didn't try to damage it or anything,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.040]   but I definitely underappreciated it
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.320]   because I approached it with such confidence.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.440]   I was overconfident.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.380]   I assumed more and I approached it with a familiarity
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.800]   that just wasn't really healthy
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.680]   and wasn't helpful for the value that the guitar had.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.100]   And so at the end of it,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.680]   I didn't really feel angry or embarrassed.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.320]   I did feel like I had missed out
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   because I had held more guitar than I will ever hold again.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.720]   I will see Jesus before I hold a guitar again.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.880]   That that has that.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.360]   Okay, so for perspective,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.480]   that's twice as much as my Honda Civic.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.520]   That would buy half of my college degree.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.100]   If I drop it, I have a new mortgage.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.940]   You with me?
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.760]   I mean, this is scary.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.000]   And so instead, normally,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.280]   if I had known that on the front end,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.520]   if I had realized what I was approaching was that valuable,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.240]   I wouldn't have treated it as if it was so familiar,
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.880]   so routine, so easy, so nonchalantly.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.520]   And so instead, at the end,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.480]   then I would have instead approached it, enjoyed it more.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.200]   And then I would have been able to appreciate it.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.320]   And then instead, I was left feeling like
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.700]   I couldn't even remember what that was like.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.960]   And I missed out.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.360]   I missed the experience of the guitar.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.440]   And here's why that's our starting point for tonight.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.320]   Because if you have any exposure whatsoever
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.800]   to the story of Jesus,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.040]   even if you're not really a church person or a Bible person,
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.100]   if you've heard of Jesus,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.840]   you've probably heard him associated
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.200]   with this thing called the cross.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.640]   And know that that's somehow central
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.280]   to the message of Jesus.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.120]   And it absolutely is.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.400]   It's the most valuable part of his story, of his life,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.480]   second maybe only to the resurrection.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.400]   And so I think that we're in danger
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   of missing out in the cross what I missed out on the guitar.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.880]   And that's this, that the cross is so familiar to us,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.360]   it's so routine to us, we see it everywhere,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.960]   that it is difficult for us to appreciate
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.840]   what is actually being communicated to us from it.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.760]   How valuable it is, how worth it, how worthy it is,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.040]   how precious that it actually is.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.420]   And I think that's due to familiarity.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.000]   Think about all the places you see the cross.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.680]   It's all over the place.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.420]   You see it on walls, you see it hanging around.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.540]   We beautify it, we encrust it with jewels,
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.720]   and we make it really decorative,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.360]   and we try to make it pretty,
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.480]   and we put it on our necks, and we put it on our wrists,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.320]   and we put it on our T-shirts.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.520]   It's like how did it get on the back pockets of your jeans?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.480]   What is the cross doing there?
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.200]   And so it has somehow become like ubiquitous.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.320]   I mean, it's everywhere,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.800]   and it continues to seem to lose its meaning a little bit.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.140]   Because that's what happens
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.720]   when something becomes increasingly familiar.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.800]   As we stop approaching it as if it's worthwhile and valuable.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.160]   And if there's any symbol in the history of the world,
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.020]   big statement, if there's any symbol
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.940]   in the history of the world
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.240]   that's lost its original connotation,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.340]   its original meaning, it's the cross.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.300]   The cross was an instrument of torture.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.020]   It was designed to produce the most excruciating death ever.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.620]   It would be akin to like the electric chair,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.460]   or the gallows, or the guillotine.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.900]   And so if you wanna get a little closer to the cross,
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.300]   imagine instead of coming into like a church,
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.180]   where I grew up there was a cross in the background,
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.020]   but there was like the podium,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.900]   and then there was the cross.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.100]   And so imagine walking into an environment like that,
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.200]   and instead of seeing a cross,
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.660]   you see an electric chair sitting there on stage.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.740]   Or imagine coming out of the children's wing
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.060]   of Vacation Bible School,
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.740]   or Vacation Bible School,
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.860]   and instead of seeing people
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.620]   with little crosses made out of yarn,
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.220]   and little decorative crosses around their necks,
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.860]   instead they've got hangman's nooses
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.700]   hanging around their neck.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:03.520]   And they come up and say,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.460]   "Hey, mommy, look what they taught me today.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.100]   "Now we're getting warm."
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.760]   That is the original connotation of the cross.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.900]   And so what I wanna do,
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.940]   and so it's so easy for us to be so confident
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.340]   on this subject, it's so easy.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.820]   And I know the skeptic wants to rise up,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.620]   and so, because I know how it is, man.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.380]   It's like, you went to work,
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.460]   I'm not sure if I'm going to the porch.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.700]   Okay, I'm going to the porch.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.040]   I park, it's so far away.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.380]   I came in, oh, it's so cloudy, it's still cloudy.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.620]   I come in, it's crowded again,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.500]   and I go through the worship,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.500]   and it's like, it's really loud.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.340]   And then the message comes on,
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.140]   "It's not even JP."
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.580]   And then we're talking about the cross,
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.980]   we're talking Jesus 101, okay?
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.980]   But I wanna tell you, I wanna call all those things,
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.580]   and so, come on, come with me.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.620]   And so, I'm gonna go ahead and call all those things
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.440]   barriers for you tonight.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.140]   I'm gonna call all those assumptions,
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.860]   and all that confidence, and all that skepticism,
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.780]   and all that, I already know this,
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.180]   I'm gonna lump all that together,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.060]   and I'm gonna write on that bag barriers,
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.220]   and I'm gonna invite you with me to put that outside,
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.520]   and instead come ready to see the cross in a new way.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.100]   So that's what we're gonna do tonight.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.460]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.420]   So I wanna show you three things specifically tonight.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.380]   First, that the cross anchors in history.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.820]   I'll tell you what that means.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.100]   First, that the cross anchors in history.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.540]   Secondly, that the cross defeats all sin.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.300]   I'll give you three specific ways that it does that,
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.420]   and that second point, and then lastly,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.660]   that the cross ends all fear, it ends all fear.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.460]   So that's where we'll finish tonight, that's the roadmap.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.700]   And so first, the cross anchors in history.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.820]   What does it mean that the cross anchors in history?
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.900]   Well, to understand what that means,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.220]   I wanna give you a definition tonight for the cross.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.220]   And when I'm saying the cross,
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.700]   I don't mean the symbol tonight.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.360]   When I say the cross, I don't even mean
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.160]   the actual instrument, the actual wooden thing.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.740]   What I mean is a scene, I mean an event.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.020]   And so when you hear me say the cross,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.340]   what I mean is an event, an actual historical event
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.900]   that really happened.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.700]   And that's important because somehow,
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.420]   in spiritual matters in our day and age,
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.700]   it seems really popular.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.700]   When it comes to spiritual matters
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.380]   and we really start to dive in,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.420]   when we see something of spiritual significance,
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.140]   for some reason we wanna picture it as ethereal
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.980]   or mystical or kinda cloudy and fuzzy and out there,
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.020]   but the cross is something that actually happened
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.580]   in real history.
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.060]   Like if you went far enough mileage-wise
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.500]   and were able to go back far enough time-wise,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.060]   you could show up.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.660]   It's just as real as the fact that you woke up this morning,
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.460]   that you went to the ATM yesterday,
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.660]   that the War of 1812 happened,
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.940]   nobody knows much about that,
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.460]   that doesn't really prompt a response,
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.020]   but that Columbus sailed the ocean blue,
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.340]   all of these things are real.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.900]   I'm giving you all these images
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.200]   and they all have one thing in common,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.140]   they're real events that really happened in history.
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.180]   In three dimensions, people with real feelings
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.940]   took part in these things.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.020]   And the cross does not operate in some separate sphere,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.420]   it's real, it's tangible.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.660]   If you had shown up, are you ready for this?
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.620]   If you had shown up and seen it,
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.740]   you could have captured it with an iPhone,
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.580]   you could have recorded it.
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.620]   So when you see something memorable,
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.220]   out comes the iPhone, you start to record.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.700]   And the reason I know that
[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.100]   is because the very best recording technology of the day
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.220]   was ink on paper, and that's exactly what they used
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.980]   to bring this history to us.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.780]   And so as we approach the cross,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.060]   I wanna tell you it's a historical thing,
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.140]   it's a real thing, and it's a brutal thing.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.340]   And so the Romans perfected the cross
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.340]   as an execution method.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.940]   And so it was called 1,000 deaths in one.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.540]   It wasn't something you talked about casually
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.380]   before Sunday lunch, it was more like something
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.780]   the mothers would cover their kids ears at.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.780]   And in fact, the cross did not become
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.700]   the symbol of Christianity,
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.860]   until everyone who had actually seen one had died.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.300]   Until there was no more living memory whatsoever
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.100]   of the cross, it did not become the symbol of Christianity
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.300]   because the connotation was too gruesome.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.700]   It's a real thing, it was anchored in history.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.740]   I wanna give you a verse for that before we move on.
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.100]   It's 1 Corinthians 15, three through four,
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.940]   it goes like this.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.420]   "For I delivered to you as of first importance
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.020]   "what I also received."
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.460]   Okay, pause, what does that sound like?
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.060]   This is history, he's taking it, I'm passing it on.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.260]   I'm taking what I first heard of first importance
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.140]   and I'm delivering it on to you.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.540]   I'm not modifying it, I'm not creating it,
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.940]   I'm not getting creative when I pass this history on to you,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.780]   I'm taking it and I'm giving it on to you.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.300]   That's the only way to pass on accurate history,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.700]   and that's exactly the spirit
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.020]   that is taken by the New Testament.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.780]   The New Testament does not treat the cross
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.820]   as if it's mystical, it treats it as if it's real.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.340]   And so I pass these things on to you as of first importance
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.660]   that Christ died, there's your cross,
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.500]   Christ died for our sins.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.340]   In accordance with the scriptures,
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.180]   that he was buried and rose on the third day
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.300]   in accordance with the scriptures.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.620]   The cross anchors in history.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.140]   My second point this evening
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.700]   is that the cross defeats all sin.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.060]   The cross defeats all sin.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.780]   And so I wanna give you three ways,
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.900]   they all start with P in this section,
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.060]   that the cross defeats all sin.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.340]   It has to do with the penalty of sin,
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.940]   the power of sin and the presence of sin.
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.340]   So we're gonna go through that together.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.980]   So the cross removes the penalty of sin.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.980]   And before I even tell you what that means,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.780]   it feels like that could be news,
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.220]   like that there's sin and that there's a penalty.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.060]   And so that can catch you by surprise.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.780]   And then, oh, there's this thing that's called sin,
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.620]   there's this, then I have a penalty to pay,
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.060]   and whoa, it's already paid.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.460]   That would be like, imagine for a second
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.660]   that you come home from work and you show up
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.620]   and your roommate's there, they're looking right at you.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.580]   And they say, "Hey, I paid your bill."
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.580]   Like, who are you, what have you done with my roommate?
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.540]   I have a great roommate, by the way,
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.500]   it would not be unusual.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.660]   But imagine that your roommate says to you,
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.580]   "I paid your bill."
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.260]   It's like, oh man, that's great, thank you.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.180]   What bill did you pay?
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.660]   Water?
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.500]   40 bucks?
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.700]   No?
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.540]   Did you pay the electricity?
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.260]   90 bucks?
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.780]   I know you didn't pay the rent.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:10.740]   I want you to imagine he looks back at you and says,
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.380]   "I paid your taxes."
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:13.340]   The ones you didn't know about?
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.780]   Yeah, the IRS called, 100,000, paid.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.940]   Just for you, free gift.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.180]   Penalty you didn't know you had,
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.940]   that you couldn't pay, paid.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.660]   Free gift, that's it.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.140]   You would respond a little bit differently
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.980]   than if they paid the water bill.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.340]   You would respond strongly because there is freedom now
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.420]   from a penalty that would have been imposed upon you.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.700]   And so Romans chapter three, verse 23,
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.180]   this is a familiar verse for some.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.420]   It says, "For all have sinned
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:46.780]   "and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.700]   All, and so I'm not a Greek scholar,
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.740]   I wanna give you that confession.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.980]   I'm not a Greek scholar.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.420]   I am confident that if we did a word study of the word all,
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.660]   it would come back A-L-L, all.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.820]   Like, all have sinned, every single one of us have sinned
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.380]   and fallen short of the glory of God,
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.980]   and are, but, but are justified by his grace
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.820]   as a free gift, penalty paid.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.300]   And so I wanna show you something in this next paragraph
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.540]   that's worth underlining, it's worth paying attention to.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.020]   Not just that the penalty is paid,
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.580]   but actually the method through which it was done.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.940]   And so this is the next verse.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.580]   It says, "This was to show God's righteousness."
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.580]   What's his righteousness?
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.740]   Just his rightness, his perfection, his rightness.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.460]   "This," this cross, "was to show God's rightness
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.100]   "because in his divine forbearance," his patience,
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.420]   "he had passed over former sins."
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.660]   Okay, so here's what that means.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.180]   "At the beginning of history,
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.620]   "when human beings started to sin,"
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.180]   because remember, all human beings have sinned
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.300]   and fallen short of the glory of God,
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.780]   beginning with the very first one.
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.500]   And so as soon as human beings started to sin,
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.020]   God didn't just start unleashing justice on them
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.100]   as soon as they did.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   Although that would have, that would not,
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.260]   he would not have ceased to be God and be good
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.420]   if he had done that.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.420]   He wasn't just unleashing the arrows of justice
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.140]   every time somebody would sin.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.460]   Instead, he waited, he passed over former sins.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.340]   And when it was time to let the arrow of justice fly,
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.900]   he pointed it at the one person
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.460]   who had never done anything wrong ever.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.300]   And so for all of humanity,
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.460]   for everyone who has ever lived and ever sinned,
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.580]   he passed over those sins until the time that Jesus came.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.780]   It says, "This was to show his righteousness
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.460]   "at the present time," that's at the time of the cross,
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.740]   "so that he might be,"
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.580]   and these next four words are huge,
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:41.580]   "just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:46.820]   The just and the justifier.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.980]   This arrangement happened so that God
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.460]   could be the just and the justifier.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.300]   What does that mean?
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.620]   At the cross, you might have heard this before,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.060]   at the cross, we see an intersection
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.860]   of two things really vividly.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.620]   We see God's love and we see God's justice.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.540]   We see God's love and we see God's justice.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.300]   Justice, let's talk about first.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.260]   Justice is something that means
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.820]   it's just simply to right the wrongs.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.140]   To make wrong things right, that's what justice is.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.620]   That's what judges do.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.900]   That's what good ones do.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.380]   And sometimes we wanna come down on God for his justice.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.860]   It makes us a little uncomfortable inside.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.740]   But I just wanna remind us
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.780]   that good judges make wrong things right.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.700]   In the state of Texas,
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700]   if judges don't make wrong things right,
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.260]   you fire them, okay, like they're done.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.580]   And so we all know that good judges make wrong things right.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.740]   This is exactly what God does.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.220]   You can see that at the cross.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.500]   Look at the man on it, he's crushed.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.620]   The one from whom this punishment came
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.520]   must have been very serious about the wrong that was done.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.340]   You can see the justice that's carried out there.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.460]   You can also see God's love at the cross
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.740]   because oh yeah, that's not any of us on it
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.060]   who deserved it, who should have been there.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:03.020]   And so what the phrase means, just and the justifier,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.380]   is that God didn't come down to earth
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.460]   just to be exactly right.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.300]   God praised God that he did not come all the way down here
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.140]   just to be exactly right.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.300]   He came down here and was exactly right
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.700]   and made all the wrong people right.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.780]   Set them right with him.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.540]   That's what it means to justify someone,
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.020]   to set them right, to give them right standing before God.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.980]   And so at the cross, you see Jesus
[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:33.340]   pinned by God's justice out of God's love for us
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.540]   so that God might be shown to be both just
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.500]   and the justifier.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.300]   There are, you think there's more at the cross
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.820]   than you thought there was?
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.860]   It's four words in your Bible.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.700]   It's amazing.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.420]   So the cross removes the penalty of sin.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.460]   The cross also removes the power of sin.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.140]   You ever felt like sin was gonna have its
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.500]   final way over you?
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.620]   You ever felt like sin just had its ultimate power over you,
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.220]   like the strongest force in your life was sin?
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.540]   And so before you know it, you look up
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.540]   and you start to think things like this.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.580]   Narcissism and self-centeredness will always
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.620]   have its way over me.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.260]   Porn will always be a part of my life.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.980]   It just will be.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.740]   Anger and losing self-control, it's just gonna mark me.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.340]   That's what it sounds like to feel like
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.300]   sin has its ultimate power over you.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.020]   And that's about as hopeless as it gets.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.580]   To think that your entire future is gonna be marked out
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.660]   by either a past history or a present tendency
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.300]   because of the power of sin is going to affect
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.180]   your entire future.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.460]   To feel marked in that way is about as hopeless
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.100]   as I can possibly imagine.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:47.220]   I've been there.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.460]   Thought all those things.
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.580]   And they are lies.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.380]   And I know that because of what Romans chapter six says.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.500]   This is verse six.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.860]   It says, "We know that our old self was crucified with him."
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.660]   Okay, our old self, that's the part, you know,
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.380]   that was not able not to sin.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.460]   Not able not to sin, but that old self
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.700]   that was captive to sin was crucified, there's the cross,
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.180]   pinned to the cross associated with Jesus.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.980]   So the part of you that was powerless,
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.740]   the part of you that was unable to keep from sinning
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.660]   was pinned onto the cross with Jesus.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.620]   Why?
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.620]   "In order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.660]   "so that we," that's you and I,
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.140]   Porch, Dallas, Fort Worth,
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.820]   "so that the body of sin that used to mark us
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.740]   "would be brought to nothing,
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.760]   "so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.760]   "For one who has died has been set free from sin."
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.200]   So the part of you that was enslaved to sin
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   is associated strongly with Jesus
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.120]   and completely with Jesus on the cross.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.200]   And so today, sin's power over you is gone.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.120]   If you're in Christ, if you trusted in Christ
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.200]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.080]   and trusted in his death and resurrection
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.340]   and his work on your behalf,
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.740]   that means sin does not have to mark you today or any day.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.120]   To put it as simply as possible,
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.760]   you don't have to do those things anymore.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.040]   That's the beauty of the cross.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.280]   And the separating power of shame is done.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.280]   The separating power, this is what sin does.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.680]   This is its greatest tool, it's to separate us from God.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.040]   It's what it does and it's its result.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.800]   And instead, Christ brings us back
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.280]   and through the power of his death on the cross,
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:40.680]   gives us an all-access pass back to God.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.600]   That's good news.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   A couple of years ago, I was in Atlanta
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.960]   for a gathering of Christians at a conference.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.040]   And so I'd never done that before.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.880]   I trusted Christ when I was about 20 years old.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.640]   And I'd never really gone to a big gathering
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.720]   of Jesus followers.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.360]   That was not really my scene.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.640]   And, but we showed up in Atlanta for this gathering.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.000]   I was a new believer in Christ and we get there
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.680]   and I would find out later
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.920]   that there were gonna be 20,000 people at this event.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.800]   It was gonna be at Phillips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.880]   where the Hawks play.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.360]   And so, that's the Atlanta, oh wait, is it Hawks?
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.240]   Yes, the Atlanta Hawks, sorry.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.680]   I'm not really a basketball person, forgive me.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.880]   So we show up and we think, we drove all through the night.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.960]   So we drove midnight, this is January 1st, 2010.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.240]   We drove from midnight to noon
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.840]   to get from Dallas to Atlanta.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.240]   And so we get there, the conference doesn't start
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.960]   until seven and we thought, well, we'll get there
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.680]   about an hour and a half, maybe two hours early
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.360]   to make sure we get a really good seat.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   Instead, we crash, wake up and then realize,
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.360]   okay, the event starts in a few minutes
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.160]   and we're a mile away from the site.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   And so we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.600]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.760]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.800]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.840]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.840]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.760]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.600]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.440]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.280]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.120]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.960]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.800]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.640]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.480]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.320]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.160]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.000]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:21.560]   and then we're gonna crash, wake up,

[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.120]   Whether we're in Dallas or in the Ridgely Theater,
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.480]   whether we've got headphones in our ears,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.760]   we're watching on a phone or a TV,
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.000]   we can rest right now,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.360]   because the word that Jesus spoke is alive today.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
