1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (Music)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Well, a special hello all the way from San Antonio.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 (Cheers)

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 You've heard of it, yeah.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 It's like the most forgotten city in the state of Texas.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 But, man, it's a huge honor to get to be here tonight.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And so whether you're here in this room or you're in Overflow,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 or maybe you're watching from one of the, gosh, 13 live sites,

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 it's a joy to get to be here.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And I just want to say this to the Porch team and specifically David.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Man, just so grateful getting to watch what God has been doing here at the Porch.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And I don't know if you know this, but me and my wife and I,

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 we lived in Washington State for about a decade.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And getting to watch what God is doing here among young adults is pretty supernatural.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And there's nothing like this that we've seen, I mean, in the entire U.S.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I hope you know that, that even the fact that you guys have Overflow,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 that this is a packed room, is absolutely incredible.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And I think a big piece of that, yes, is God moving in a really unique way,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 and you're a part of something really special.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 But it's also the leadership of the Porch that is, man, pushing forward

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 and really defining how young adult ministry is being done across our nation.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 You guys are setting that pace.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And so thank you guys so much.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's an honor to get to be here tonight.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And real quick, I will, I'll do a trick.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Just because I feel like you won't listen until I do.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But before I do, like David said, a year ago, my wife and I,

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 we planted a church in San Antonio.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And I think I have a picture of my wife and my family.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Yeah, there's my wife, Jane, and that's our almost two-year-old daughter, Tilly.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I think there's another picture of Tilly.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Her eyes.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Listen, there's not another human on planet Earth

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 that I love more than that little kid.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And her name's Matilda, but we call her Tilly.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So now that we got the introductions out of the way,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 this is going to get weird.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Are you guys cool with that?

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Is that okay?

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Some of you tonight, you're going to walk out of this place,

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 and you're not going to have heard anything that was said after this point.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And there will be many of you that walk out tonight a little upset and angry.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Some of you, you're going to love it.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Some of you, not so much.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 If you walk out of this place angry, sorry.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 You've been kind of warned.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But I'm going to need some volunteers that will be willing to help me out up here on stage.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And so we're going to grab a few.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Ma'am, you have your hand up.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Would you please join me up here?

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Would you guys give her a huge round of applause?

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Let's get somebody maybe over here, maybe a gentleman.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 We've got a young lady.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 We need a gentleman that's pretty--

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 I need someone that's pretty--

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 you're just excitable.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 You've got some energy.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 For real, you can do it, bro.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Wait, right here.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Yeah, come on up.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 You guys get this guy with the white shirt right here.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Sorry.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Fella, white shirt, cap.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Oh, man.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 This is now awkward.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I tried.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I'm sorry.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I feel like I let you--

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Hey, you come on.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Maybe two active.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Hopefully we can reign you in.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Come on up.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Yeah, both of you, come on up here.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Ma'am, we're going to have you come here.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Sir, you here.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I want to know each of you guys.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Tell me your name.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Cameron.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Cameron, OK.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Cameron, what do you do?

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I'm an ADT salesman.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I'm sorry?

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 ADT salesman.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 No, I heard you.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Just sorry.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I'm just kidding.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I'm just kidding.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I'm kidding.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I always tell that joke.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 OK, tell me your name.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Sadie.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Sadie.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 We've got Cameron, Sadie.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Sadie, what do you do?

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I'm a pre-K teacher.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Pre-K teacher.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Oh.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Thank you.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Bless your heart.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Man, I almost want to just stop and pray for you,

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 because I know this season has been crazy.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 So, well, here's what we're going to do.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 We're going to do a trick, and I'll be honest with you.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I've got a deck of cards.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 This is really important.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It's not a card trick, OK?

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 But what a deck of cards gives us tonight is it gives us 52 objects

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 that most people in this room are somewhat familiar with.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Correct?

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Like you've played with a deck of cards.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Perfect.

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 In a second, we're going to start with you, Cameron.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 We're going to have you select a card, OK?

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Now, so that we're all on the same page tonight,

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 this is really, really important.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 There are two parts to every playing card.

117
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Yeah, you can take that off.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Yeah, sorry.

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 There's the value of the card.

120
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 That would be, let's say, like the number or the letter,

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 if it's like a king or queen.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 That makes sense.

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It's value.

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And then there's the suit.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 You got it?

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 There are only four suits, so that we're clear.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 There are two red ones.

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 There are two black ones.

129
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The two red ones are the heart and the diamond.

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 The two black ones are the spade.

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 That's like the little shovel thing, and then the upside-down heart.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And then there's the clubs, OK?

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Or clovers, or puppy feet, depending on where you're from.

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 OK, you got it?

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You'd be so surprised.

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 There's just two.

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 There's the value, and there's the suit.

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 That's what you need to know, but people get lost.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 OK, now here's the deal.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 In just a second, like I said, I'm going to let you select a card.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Now, when people leave tonight, there's really only going to be one solution

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 that people are going to come up with.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So I'm going to go, Drew, either all of these cards--

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 you didn't have a whole lot of choices, maybe just two or three options.

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So, Cameron, I need you to be honest.

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I need you to look through there.

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 They can see this with a camera.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 All of these cards are, in fact, different.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Can you see that?

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Perfect.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You can see this as well.

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 OK?

154
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 They're pretty shuffled, too.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 They're not in any special order, nothing like that.

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Feel good?

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Feel good?

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Yes.

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 OK, super important.

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 We'll start with you.

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Cameron, I'm going to take my finger.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm just going to run through the cards like this.

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I'm going to say, stop.

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 OK?

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 You're going to take a look at the card and memorize it.

166
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 If you feel as though I stopped too soon or too late and I'm forcing a card on you,

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 or if you just don't like the card, tell me.

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 OK?

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Are we ready?

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 A lot of setup.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I know, I know.

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 You think you're nervous.

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Just wait.

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Here we go.

175
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You ready?

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Just say out loud, say stop.

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Stop.

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Right there?

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 How do you feel about-- nope, too far.

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 OK, we'll start over.

181
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Stop.

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 How about this one?

183
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Yep.

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 You feel good about this?

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I feel good about this.

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Can you memorize it?

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Thank you.

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 You won't forget it.

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I have a bad memory.

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Can you memorize it?

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Yep.

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 You got it?

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 OK, perfect.

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Now, Cameron, I want you to look there at the back wall.

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Yeah, that one.

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 You don't have to point at everything.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Yeah, yeah.

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It's my show.

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I'll tell the jokes, Cameron.

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I want you to look there.

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 You're going to imagine-- you're going to start to-- all of a sudden, you're going to see

202
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 your card become an appearance.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 I love that some of you turned around.

204
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I love that some of you turned around.

205
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I love that some of you turned around.

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It's just in his mind.

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 You're going to see the value there.

208
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 You'll see the suit.

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 In your mind, say it over and again, not out loud, just in your mind, so that you don't

210
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 forget it.

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Say it.

212
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Are you ready?

213
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Yes.

214
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Same thing.

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 If you would, just say stop.

216
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Stop.

217
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Right there, how do you feel about this?

218
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Good.

219
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You feel good?

220
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Yep.

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 You won't forget it?

222
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Nope.

223
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Perfect.

224
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Same thing.

225
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Look there at the back of the wall.

226
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Take it in your mind.

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 OK.

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Just over and over again.

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Over and over again.

230
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Perfect.

231
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 OK.

232
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Now, just to make this interesting, we're going to use a few of you in the crowd as

233
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 well.

234
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 So, I tell you what, ma'am, you have this beautiful yellow dress.

235
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Would you please stand up for me?

236
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Would you tell me your name?

237
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Paisley.

238
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Paisley.

239
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Beautiful name.

240
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Paisley, in just a second, I'm going to take these cards.

241
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I'm going to throw them to you.

242
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 OK?

243
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 If the rest of you catch these cards, here, this is how this is going to work.

244
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 We'll just take the cards, put them face down in the palm of your hand.

245
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Got it like this?

246
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 You'll be able to take your thumb.

247
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 You'll just peek open the cards.

248
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Look there.

249
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Memorize one.

250
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 It's fairly simple.

251
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 It'll save us a little time.

252
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You can leave the rubber band around them.

253
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Just, would you do me a huge favor?

254
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Would you, I could throw them, but I'm kind of nervous.

255
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 If you would, would you just take those cards, hand those to Paisley.

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 OK?

257
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Paisley, look right here at me.

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 OK?

259
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Look right here.

260
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Look right here at me.

261
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 OK?

262
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Listen to my voice, not theirs.

263
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 OK?

264
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Look right here.

265
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 OK.

266
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Perfect.

267
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Take your thumb.

268
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I want you to peek open the cards.

269
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Stay right here.

270
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,920
 Once the cards are open, look there at the card.

271
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
 Memorize it, both parts.

272
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
 You got it?

273
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
 OK.

274
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
 You can close it.

275
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
 Look right here at me.

276
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
 In your mind, see the value and the suit.

277
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
 The value and the suit.

278
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
 Very good.

279
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
 Sir, tell me your name.

280
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
 Jordan.

281
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,480
 Jordan, would you stand up real quick for me?

282
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,760
 Paisley, would you take underhand, would you toss those cards to Jordan?

283
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
 Nice.

284
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
 That was a great job.

285
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Very cool.

286
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 You can stay standing.

287
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Stay standing.

288
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Jordan, same thing.

289
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Face down.

290
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Look at the cards up with your thumb.

291
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 When you've got them open.

292
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Oh, no, don't do the top one.

293
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I mean, you can, but go somewhere in the middle.

294
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 It makes it more impressive.

295
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 OK?

296
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 You got one?

297
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Got it memorized already?

298
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Close it.

299
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Look right here at me.

300
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Value, suit.

301
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Value, suit.

302
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 OK.

303
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Let me have trouble with you.

304
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And then let's go-- ooh, sir, you look super cool.

305
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 You got this beard.

306
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I love it.

307
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Would you stand up?

308
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Tell me your name.

309
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Ryan.

310
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Is that right?

311
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 OK, perfect.

312
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Jordan, it's a long way, so will you get it to Ryan?

313
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Nice.

314
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Oh, that was--

315
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Almost perfect.

316
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Spin them around real quick.

317
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Oh, flip it.

318
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Oh, that'll make it easy.

319
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Oh, spin it.

320
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Oh, my gosh.

321
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Like a wheel.

322
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Yeah, there you go.

323
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 There you go.

324
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 There you go.

325
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Look right here at me.

326
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Look right here at me.

327
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Whenever you're ready, Ryan, open the cards.

328
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Look there at the card.

329
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Memorize it.

330
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Go ahead.

331
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Do that now.

332
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Got it?

333
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Value, suit.

334
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Value, suit.

335
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Toss the cards here.

336
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Nice.

337
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 OK.

338
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Jordan, you got it?

339
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 You got it?

340
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 OK.

341
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Value, suit.

342
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Toss the cards here.

343
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Nice.

344
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 OK, perfect.

345
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Go ahead.

346
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Stay standing.

347
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Stay standing.

348
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Jordan, stand up.

349
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 OK, perfect.

350
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 You're doing great.

351
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 OK, now look.

352
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Five cards.

353
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 We're going to try to do this very, very fast, OK?

354
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Here's what I need you to do.

355
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
 Try your best to help me out, OK?

356
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,720
 If you go blank, this is not going to work.

357
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,200
 It will all look a little awkward.

358
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,780
 But try to focus as much as you can on your card.

359
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
 This will help you.

360
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,680
 I want you to imagine going back to like the halls of a high school.

361
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
 You're walking through the hall.

362
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,320
 All of a sudden, you turn into a classroom.

363
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 It's an art room.

364
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,200
 I want you to see in the corner there's a canvas and there's an easel.

365
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
 I want you to walk towards it in your mind.

366
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,280
 And as you get close, you're going to see there's two markers.

367
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,080
 There's a red marker, a black marker.

368
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,760
 In your mind, would you grab the marker that you associate with your playing card?

369
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
 OK?

370
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,760
 Don't do anything to give it away.

371
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,760
 Perfect.

372
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
 Perfect.

373
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 Perfect.

374
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 OK.

375
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
 Cameron, you reach down.

376
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:35,080
 It will look like-- start with you.

377
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,360
 OK?

378
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 Don't give anything away.

379
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 It's either red or it's black.

380
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,560
 It's either red or it's black.

381
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
 It's either-- very good.

382
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
 OK.

383
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
 Your tails are in your eyes.

384
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
 Kind of, yeah, bump-- yeah.

385
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
 Black marker?

386
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
 Yes.

387
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
 Yes.

388
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
 It's 50/50, but it's still impressive.

389
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,560
 Cameron, right here.

390
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
 Red, black, red, black, red.

391
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
 Ooh.

392
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
 Oh, there it is.

393
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,560
 Red.

394
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,560
 Perfect.

395
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
 The rest, yes?

396
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
 Yeah, OK.

397
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
 Very good.

398
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 Right here.

399
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,480
 Jordan, I'm kind of most nervous about you.

400
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
 You reach down there.

401
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,200
 Is it a black marker?

402
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,000
 You can tell me.

403
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It's not a black marker.

404
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Am I telling you it's a black marker?

405
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Yeah, yeah, yes or no.

406
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Just saying.

407
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 It's a black marker.

408
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It was.

409
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 OK.

410
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Oh, my gosh.

411
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I knew we were going to have trouble with him.

412
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 No, you're doing great.

413
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Great, great.

414
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Here's what we're going to do.

415
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 We'll focus in.

416
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Cameron, think about yours.

417
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 OK?

418
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 You know it's either a heart or it's a diamond.

419
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,840
 It's either a heart or a diamond.

420
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
 Very good.

421
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
 OK?

422
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
 Very good.

423
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
 Very good.

424
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,280
 Focus in on the value of the card.

425
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,920
 OK?

426
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,960
 I think I got it.

427
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,240
 You guys got yours?

428
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
 Focus in on the suit.

429
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,680
 Now, with the easel, here's what I want you to do.

430
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,920
 You've got the red or the black marker.

431
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,240
 I want you to begin to draw your card in your mind.

432
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,440
 Draw the card in your mind.

433
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
 Start to draw it.

434
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,920
 I know yours is red.

435
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
 I know it's also a diamond.

436
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 OK?

437
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 Focus in on it.

438
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,960
 Cameron, I believe the card that you're thinking of is the 10 of diamonds.

439
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
 Is that correct?

440
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
 That is correct.

441
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
 Yes, you can have a seat.

442
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
 Well done.

443
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,600
 The cards came pretty fast.

444
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 This is what I saw.

445
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
 The 7 of spades, the 10 of clubs, and the king of diamonds.

446
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,720
 If I named your card, will you please have a seat?

447
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,560
 I don't know if you just saw that.

448
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,840
 I don't know if you just saw that I just got 4 out of 4.

449
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,560
 All that to say is if this doesn't work, obviously not my fault.

450
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
 OK?

451
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,880
 At this point, all we know is that your card is black.

452
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
 Focus in on it.

453
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 You're doing a great job.

454
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
 I know, it's OK.

455
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 Look ahead.

456
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,520
 Try your best not to give it away.

457
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
 I'll tell you this up front.

458
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,040
 The harder you try to not give it away, the easier you're going to make it.

459
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
 OK?

460
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
 Here we go.

461
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
 Focus in on it.

462
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
 We know it's black.

463
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
 It's a 7 of spades.

464
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 It's a club or a 7 of spades.

465
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 Very good.

466
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,960
 Oh, man.

467
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,160
 Focus in on the number.

468
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:28,840
 See, I'm going to be honest with you.

469
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,880
 I think I have an idea, but I'm not 100%.

470
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
 OK?

471
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 So here's the deal.

472
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
 If you get close, they're going to lose their mind for you.

473
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:47,440
 The card that you begin to paint in your mind, it looked as though you began to draw a number.

474
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,160
 The number that I think that you drew was some straight lines.

475
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
 It looked like maybe the 7 of clubs.

476
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
 7 of clubs, is that what it is?

477
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,160
 If you guessed right, give her a huge round of applause.

478
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
 Ta-da.

479
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
 Stop.

480
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,160
 You don't mean it.

481
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:23,080
 Well, how do you teach after that?

482
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,360
 I don't really have a great segue, so if you have a Bible, grab it.

483
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,320
 Meet me in Acts chapter 4.

484
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,200
 Actually, as you turn to Acts chapter 4, and feel free to look at the table of contents

485
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,120
 if you need to, but I want to say this.

486
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,760
 What's interesting about magic and illusions and the way that it works is this.

487
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,520
 Is that the secret to how that works was on full display on this stage right in front

488
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,800
 of you.

489
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,660
 Like every detail of how it worked was literally right in front of you.

490
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,920
 But you miss it because you're not trained to see it.

491
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,960
 Or because of what magicians would call misdirection.

492
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,080
 Your focus and your attention all goes here while the secret and the magic happens over

493
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
 here.

494
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,960
 And here's the reason I share that tonight is this.

495
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,520
 Because I believe with everything in me that not a single one of you are here by accident

496
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 or happenstance.

497
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:36,560
 Like whatever reason you walked into this place tonight, for whatever reason, you're

498
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,080
 not here by accident.

499
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,000
 That I believe that the God of the universe has pieced things together and put you in

500
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,040
 the seat that you're in because he wants to speak to you tonight.

501
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,520
 That he has something for you.

502
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,280
 And more than you being here on purpose and with intention, that I believe that the God

503
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,000
 of the universe is here tonight and my fear is this.

504
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,720
 Is that we would walk into a place like this and although his presence be on full display,

505
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,960
 that it be right in front of us.

506
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,280
 Just like the magic trick, we miss it.

507
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,160
 Just like the magic trick, our attention is diverted.

508
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,280
 We spend so much time and worried about what people think about us.

509
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,400
 Or maybe we're just here scoping and hoping and I hope I get a date out of this.

510
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,600
 Or whatever this is, like that you completely miss the God of the universe showing up and

511
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:38,040
 showing off and wanting to speak to you in a language that your heart can understand.

512
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,480
 And so tonight I want to pray for us and just ask God to speak to us in a really powerful

513
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
 and sweet way that maybe just maybe you understand.

514
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,280
 So Jesus, I believe that you're here.

515
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,760
 I believe that you're in this room and I believe that you have something in store for us all.

516
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,240
 Myself included, God.

517
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:12,680
 And I don't want to step into this space and you show up and then I miss it, God.

518
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,160
 So I pray for every person in this space.

519
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,560
 I pray for every person in the overflow, every person watching remotely, God.

520
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,360
 Right now, would you open the eyes of our heart to see you?

521
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,560
 Would you open up the ears of our heart to hear you in a unique way?

522
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,360
 And God, I pray that we'd walk out of this place forever changed.

523
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,880
 Not because some guy did a card trick, not because some guy taught well, but because

524
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,040
 you showed up and you spoke to your people.

525
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
 That's what we want.

526
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,920
 That's what we need.

527
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,360
 Not another talk.

528
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,400
 We need your presence.

529
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,480
 So speak to us tonight, Jesus, in a way that we can understand.

530
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 It's in your name we pray.

531
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
 Amen.

532
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,960
 Well, in Acts chapter four, my wife and I, we've just been walking through just a scripture

533
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,040
 app that's been chronologically just walking through the Bible and this was the passage

534
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
 that we read this morning.

535
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,520
 So I was like, this will be sweet.

536
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
 I'll just share this.

537
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,920
 But I believe that there's something in this that we're going to see tonight that ultimately

538
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,480
 is the secret to how you and I experience a life to the fullest.

539
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,960
 That Jesus shows up on the scene and in John 10, 10, he would say that I've come to give

540
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,600
 you life and life to the fullest.

541
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,800
 But if we're honest, man, very few of us actually experience that type of life.

542
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,800
 And so in Acts chapter four, we're going to start in verse one, but let me kind of set

543
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,200
 the stage so you know what's going on.

544
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,760
 Acts is just really the story of the early church.

545
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,560
 And you've got a couple of Jesus's followers who are hanging out and all of a sudden the

546
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,120
 Holy Spirit just descends on them.

547
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,800
 They begin to just share the gospel and people's lives begin to get changed.

548
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,520
 And Peter and John, two of these disciples, these followers of Jesus are on their way

549
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,200
 to the temple, on the way to a church service, a lot like the porch.

550
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,200
 And they come in contact with a beggar, a lame beggar, can't walk, who's been outside

551
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
 of the temple.

552
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
 The scripture is going to tell us that he's about 40 years old and he's been there for

553
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,920
 majority of his life.

554
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
 So he's pretty well known.

555
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,880
 And if you've got to think about it, if you're going to beg for money, doing it outside of

556
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,480
 a church is not a bad place to do it.

557
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,840
 And so Peter and John are walking towards the temple.

558
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,880
 They come up to this lame beggar.

559
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
 He asked for money.

560
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,940
 They kind of bypass him for a second and then they stop, they pause, they turn and they

561
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
 look at him.

562
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,720
 And they're thinking like this lame beggar is like, cha-ching, here we go, payday.

563
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,240
 And Peter and John, these two men look at him and go, "Hey, listen, silver and gold,

564
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,440
 we don't have it.

565
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,460
 But what we do have, we give freely in the name of Jesus, get up and walk."

566
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,420
 And all of a sudden the muscles in this man's leg begin to like strengthen and his legs

567
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,280
 begin to like straighten.

568
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,440
 And he stands up for the very first time and he begins to walk.

569
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,360
 And the Scripture tells us not only that, he's kind of skipping, he's almost dancing

570
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
 to the people in the synagogues are paying attention going, "What in the world?

571
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,560
 Like we know this guy, how did this happen?"

572
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,280
 And so they begin to point to Jesus and lives begin to be changed.

573
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,600
 It's causing this great commotion.

574
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,360
 And so then the religious leaders at the time grab Peter and John because they're causing

575
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,620
 all this commotion.

576
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,720
 They throw them in prison and they're like, "What do we do?

577
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
 It's pretty late.

578
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,360
 Maybe we should deal with it tomorrow."

579
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,520
 And that's where we find ourselves in this story.

580
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
 Got it?

581
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
 Perfect.

582
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,040
 So chapter four, verse one, this is what it says.

583
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,560
 It says, "The priest and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to

584
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,520
 Peter and John while they were speaking to the people."

585
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,120
 Just side note, Sadducees are the religious leaders of the day.

586
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,320
 Fun fact, they're the ones who put Jesus on trial and put him on this kind of this, this

587
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,920
 whole false witness.

588
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,060
 And they're ultimately the ones that execute him.

589
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,040
 And so the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection.

590
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,640
 And that you'll see that's kind of just a fun fact.

591
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,880
 Verse two says, "They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people

592
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,340
 and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.

593
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,440
 So they seized Peter and John because it was evening.

594
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,840
 They put them in jail until the next day.

595
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:25,500
 But many who heard the message believed and the number of men grew to about 5,000.

596
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,600
 The next day the rulers and elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.

597
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,920
 And I as the high priest was there.

598
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,280
 And so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and the other men of the high priest family.

599
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,280
 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them by what power or

600
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
 what name did you do this?

601
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,580
 And then Peter filled with the Holy Spirit said to them, 'Rulers and elders of the people,

602
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,980
 if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple or asked

603
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:03,200
 how he was healed, then know this, you and all the people of Israel, it is by the name

604
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,280
 of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified, but whom God raised from the dead that this

605
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,040
 man stands before you healed.

606
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,800
 He is the stone that you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.'"

607
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,540
 And verse 12, watch this, "Salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name

608
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,520
 under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."

609
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,080
 If you're taking notes tonight, man, point number one, the secret of life is this, that

610
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
 the message has to be clear.

611
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 Your message has to be clear.

612
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,580
 Now real quick, one of my favorite things, we moved to San Antonio about three years

613
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,760
 ago and was so grateful to move back to the south because you guys have, my wife and I's

614
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,980
 favorite restaurant in the world, a place called Chick-fil-A.

615
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,720
 And we love it, absolutely love it.

616
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,320
 So do they.

617
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,120
 But Chick-fil-A, listen, and most of us, we do, we love it.

618
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,040
 And there might be some different camps and maybe divided a little bit on maybe the sauce

619
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,740
 choice or maybe it's like, hey, it's sweet tea versus lemonade, or maybe it's like the

620
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,600
 Chick-fil-A sandwich versus the nuggets.

621
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,480
 But here's what's interesting.

622
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,000
 The vast majority of us love it really, really well.

623
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,560
 And somehow, someway, Chick-fil-A is hired like two renegade cows that are vandalizing

624
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,200
 billboards all across the southeast.

625
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,400
 And no matter what place you find yourself, whatever side you find yourself, all of us

626
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
 in this room know Chick-fil-A's slogan.

627
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,920
 It's three simple words.

628
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,400
 You know it, right?

629
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,560
 Eat more chicken.

630
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,040
 Why do you know that?

631
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,580
 Because Chick-fil-A's message is unbelievably clear.

632
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,120
 Unbelievably clear.

633
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:04,820
 And what is sad is this, that the world in which we live right now is dying for the answers

634
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,240
 that you and I claim to have.

635
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,440
 This about the hope that we claim to have, and sadly, the church right now finds itself

636
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
 stuttering.

637
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
 It finds itself confused.

638
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,720
 And so it's no matter that even in your own heart, when you think about the message that

639
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,680
 you've given your life to, that you claim to be, man, I've given my whole life to Jesus,

640
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,800
 surrendered everything to it.

641
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:39,520
 But why is it that the message is so unclear, even for our own hearts?

642
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,200
 We don't necessarily really even know what exactly it is that we're living for, some

643
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
 of us.

644
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,880
 Now listen, I didn't grow up in the church, so I didn't know like most of this stuff.

645
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,280
 I remember sitting down with a youth pastor when I was almost a senior in high school,

646
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,320
 and he goes, "Drew, can I just ask you a few questions?"

647
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 I'm like, "Yeah, shoot for it."

648
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,160
 And I was like, "Hey," he's like, "what do you know about the Bible?"

649
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,200
 I was like, "Ah, I'm pretty sure Jesus is like the main character."

650
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
 He's like, "Yeah, good."

651
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,920
 And he goes, "Drew, can I tell you this, or can I ask you this?

652
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,360
 If I could tell you the whole story in just three or four minutes, would you want to know?"

653
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,400
 And I was like, "Yeah, bro.

654
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,840
 Like you bought lunch, sure, I'm listening."

655
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,280
 And listen, I'll never forget what he said.

656
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 He said, "Drew, in the very beginning of this book was just God, in perfect relationship

657
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,000
 with himself, and there was nothing else.

658
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,080
 And God begins to speak the world into existence, creates all things with just His words.

659
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,960
 On the sixth day, God reaches into the dirt and He forms mankind.

660
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,200
 It would be the first thing that God ever touches.

661
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,280
 He breathes life into man."

662
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
 Why?

663
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,720
 So that we would have this opportunity to have this intimate, deep relationship with

664
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,320
 the God of the universe, that we could be fully known, fully loved, fully treasured

665
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
 by Him.

666
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,000
 And we make it three chapters into the book before we totally screw it all up.

667
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Then we go, "God, hey, thanks, but no thanks.

668
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,400
 Like I want to be king, I want to be captain, so would you just slide off the throne and

669
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
 let me take charge?"

670
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,880
 And in that moment, sin entered into the world and it fractured it.

671
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
 It broke it.

672
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,680
 In real talk, listen, I don't have to convince you of that.

673
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,200
 You don't watch the news for very long or flip through Twitter before you're like, "Yeah,

674
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,280
 it's pretty broken.

675
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 It's jacked up.

676
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,080
 Surely this isn't the way God intended it."

677
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,760
 Or better yet, listen, love my daughter, she's about to hit two.

678
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,160
 Listen, you don't have to hang out with a two-year-old very long before you're like,

679
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,080
 "Dang, that's like the most evil creature on planet earth right there."

680
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
 Amen?

681
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
 Yeah.

682
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,800
 But here's what's interesting, think about this.

683
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,320
 My wife and I, we don't sit down with Tilly and go, "Hey, listen, when you don't get your

684
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,280
 way, you need to bite people.

685
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,320
 Let me show you how to do that.

686
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,080
 When you get frustrated, throw a punch.

687
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,080
 Like scream."

688
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
 No, no, no.

689
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,560
 That's inside of her.

690
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
 She's born with it.

691
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,880
 That's her default setting that every single one of us, that's where we find ourselves,

692
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,960
 that the sin of our great, great grandparents have been passed down from father to son,

693
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,320
 mother to daughter, and it's in every one of us, like a cancer, a plague that's killing

694
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 us.

695
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,760
 In the entire Old Testament, although it's filled with a bunch of really crazy stories,

696
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,640
 it's all just one giant promise, and this is the promise that God sees you in your brokenness,

697
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,120
 and He loves you too much to leave you there.

698
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,920
 And one day, He's sending a hero to fix every bit of it.

699
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,600
 And so when you turn the pages from Malachi into Matthew, or Old Testament into the New

700
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,200
 Testament, you see that the hero actually shows up, but it's not what anyone expected.

701
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,280
 Because the hero was actually God Himself that was willing to leave His throne room,

702
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,200
 His kingdom, wrap Himself in human flesh, and move into our trailer park.

703
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,040
 That's who Jesus was.

704
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,480
 Like God in the flesh.

705
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 God incarnate.

706
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,680
 So we call Him Emmanuel at Christmas, because God is with us.

707
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
 He's here.

708
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
 He's present.

709
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:39,720
 He walks on earth for 33 perfect years, teaching us what it means to be fully human, fully

710
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,120
 alive.

711
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,040
 And then He willingly lays His life down on our cross.

712
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
 Don't miss that.

713
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
 That wasn't Jesus' cross.

714
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,120
 It was yours.

715
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,040
 That was our death penalty for our treason against the God of the universe.

716
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,680
 And He willingly lays His life down on that cross, crucified, placed into a tomb, and

717
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,040
 then three days later, He walks out of the grave, proving that He has the power over

718
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,880
 sin and death, and all who call upon the name, all who take their lives like Texas Hold 'Em

719
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,960
 style and push the chips in and say, "It's all yours.

720
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,880
 I'll step off the throne.

721
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
 You be the captain.

722
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,060
 You call the shots."

723
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,440
 In that moment, something miraculous happens.

724
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,360
 The Bible would tell us this, that we go from being enemies of God, slaves to our sin, and

725
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,120
 the moment we say yes to Him, that we get adopted into the family, no longer orphans,

726
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,880
 but now sons and daughters of the King of the universe.

727
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,680
 That's our message.

728
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
 That's our message.

729
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,840
 Porch, hear me.

730
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,680
 Do not leave this place thinking that the message of Christianity is that Jesus came

731
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,440
 to this earth to take bad people and make them good people.

732
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,200
 That's not Christianity.

733
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,280
 Christianity is that Jesus came to take dead people and bring them to life.

734
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,720
 That's what it means to follow after Jesus.

735
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,200
 And our message has to be clear.

736
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,960
 Listen, not just to the world around us, but to us, but to ourselves.

737
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,880
 You know why many of us live such defeated lives?

738
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,440
 Because that's not the story we believe.

739
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,520
 We think, "Man, Jesus, you just came here to help me not cuss as much.

740
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,440
 Didn't you die on the cross just so I would watch a few less rated R movies?"

741
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,960
 Like we joke, right?

742
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,240
 But that's what many of you believe by your actions.

743
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,480
 What if you really did begin to believe that the same power that rose Jesus Christ from

744
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,640
 the grave now, of course, is through your veins, and that you can live a life of victory?

745
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,200
 We're running out of time.

746
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,560
 Point number two is this.

747
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,320
 Not only does the message need to be clear, but also we'll see that these men were marked

748
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 by Christ.

749
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,720
 In verse 13, it says, "When they saw," so the Sadducees saw the courage of Peter and

750
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,840
 John and they realized that they were unschooled, uneducated, ordinary men.

751
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,240
 They were astonished and took note that these men had been with Jesus.

752
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,360
 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was

753
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,000
 nothing they could say.

754
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,440
 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and confer together.

755
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,160
 "What are we going to do with these men?" they ask.

756
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,360
 Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle and we can't deny

757
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
 it.

758
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,280
 But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these

759
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,320
 men to speak no longer to anyone in this name.

760
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
 So point number two is this.

761
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,960
 They were marked by Christ.

762
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,640
 They were marked by Christ.

763
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,920
 These religious leaders look and go, "Hey, listen, those two guys, here's what's obvious.

764
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,880
 Listen, they're not very educated, they're not real smart, they're unschooled, but here's

765
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,040
 what's really clear.

766
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,760
 Those guys been with Jesus.

767
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,680
 How do they know that?

768
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
 Think about this.

769
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,440
 When Jesus was put on the cross, the disciples, they all peaced out.

770
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,640
 Like none of them were around.

771
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,360
 How was it obvious that those two guys had been with Jesus?"

772
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,080
 Well, let me paint it this way.

773
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,800
 Right after I graduated college, I jumped in a car with a musician named Josh and we

774
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,200
 spent a year and a half touring around America, just making loops around the US.

775
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,800
 Eventually, we would move to Washington.

776
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 We ended up planning a church together and would serve together for a decade.

777
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,320
 So we go to college together, we spend all this time together.

778
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,940
 Now here's the deal.

779
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,240
 If I were to invite Josh out on the stage, which he's not here, he's in Washington still,

780
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,180
 but if I were to invite him out and we would get a chance to hang out or maybe go grab

781
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,880
 coffee afterwards.

782
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,600
 Couple things that you would notice pretty quick.

783
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,000
 You're like, "Dang, Drew, you and Josh are super similar.

784
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,040
 Like you talk a lot alike.

785
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,200
 You have the same inflection, like same mannerisms.

786
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,880
 You tell a lot of the same stories and jokes, most of which he stole from me."

787
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,320
 And so, but here's the deal.

788
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,760
 Why does that happen?

789
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,480
 Why is that true?

790
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,480
 It's not because we set aside and go, "Hey, let's practice our moves here.

791
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,760
 Like how do you do your hand when you talk?

792
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,600
 Like is that how it works for you?"

793
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,400
 No, no, no.

794
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:28,120
 The reason that we're so similar is because we spent every single waking moment for a

795
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:34,640
 year and a half living together side by side in a car.

796
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,080
 Why was it so obvious that these men had been with Jesus?

797
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:45,840
 Is because for every single waking moment of their life for three solid years, they

798
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,440
 were side by side with Jesus.

799
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,040
 It was obvious those guys have been with Jesus.

800
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,480
 They talk just like Him.

801
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,760
 They've got the same mannerisms, the same stories they tell.

802
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
 It's just like Jesus.

803
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
 It's obvious that they've been with Him.

804
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,960
 So then maybe the million dollar question for you and I is this, is it obvious that

805
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,600
 we've been with Jesus?

806
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,400
 Are we marked by Christ?

807
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,440
 When your coworker looks at you, when your friends hang out with you, is it obvious that

808
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,760
 you've been hanging out with Jesus?

809
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,160
 To go, "Hey, listen, the real talk, I don't know if I believe in all of this stuff.

810
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,080
 I don't know how I feel about Jesus, but here's what I do know.

811
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,560
 If He was on earth, I'm willing to bet He'd talk a lot like you do.

812
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,160
 I'm willing to bet He'd live like you do.

813
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,200
 I'm willing to bet He would love like you do, that He would listen like you do, that

814
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,440
 He would care like you do.

815
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,560
 That it's obvious that you've been with Jesus.

816
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,440
 And here's the deal, church, please don't miss this.

817
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,040
 It's not about performance.

818
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,600
 It's all about proximity.

819
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:05,160
 That over time as you walk with Jesus, as you build intimacy, and you begin to look

820
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,120
 more and more like Him, the pieces of you that look like you begin to fade away and

821
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,480
 He begins to step into the spotlight.

822
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,880
 Church, is it obvious that you've been with Him?

823
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,520
 It breaks my heart to think that the vast majority are going to leave this place tonight

824
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,200
 and what you're going to hear is you need to leave this place and start performing.

825
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,760
 Start doing more theater, acting more like Jesus.

826
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,680
 That's where we get the idea of hypocrisy, that it's just theater.

827
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:44,800
 But as you walk with Jesus, as you know Him intimately, He begins to change you.

828
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,720
 Listen, and this is going to, some of you aren't going to believe this and I'm okay

829
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,120
 with it.

830
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:01,360
 The love of Jesus is more real than the chair you're seated in right now.

831
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:09,520
 Jesus is not a philosophy or a theory or something that you subscribe to.

832
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,720
 It's actually something and someone you can experience.

833
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,020
 And it breaks my heart to think that the vast majority of us are going to continue playing

834
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,760
 a game and missing out on that love that He offers.

835
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,460
 The third thing is, not only is the message clear and marked by Christ, but they were

836
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,120
 motivated by the cross.

837
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,280
 They were motivated by the cross.

838
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,200
 In verse 18 it says, "Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or

839
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,360
 teach at all in the name of Jesus.

840
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,360
 But Peter and John," I love this, "replied, 'Judge for yourselves whether it is right

841
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,960
 in God's sight to obey you rather than God, for we can't help speaking about what we've

842
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
 seen and heard.'

843
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,360
 And after further threats they let them go.

844
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,640
 They could not decide how to punish them because all the people were praising God for what

845
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,560
 had happened, for the man who was miraculously healed was over 40 years old."

846
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,440
 So listen, the religious leaders pull Peter and John aside and they go, "Hey guys, come

847
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
 here real quick.

848
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
 We're going to chat with you."

849
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
 They go, "Here's the deal.

850
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,920
 We're going to let you go to kind of keep things from getting a little crazy, but here's

851
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,360
 what we need you to do.

852
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
 This whole Jesus stuff, we need to keep it on the DL.

853
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,720
 A little hush-hush if you don't mind.

854
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:27,040
 And if we don't mention this again, we'll be cool."

855
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,480
 And Peter and John's response in that moment is, "Hey listen, that's ultimately between

856
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,600
 you and God.

857
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,920
 He gets to decide that.

858
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,560
 But here's what we know for certain.

859
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,160
 We can't help but speak about the things that we've seen and heard.

860
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,000
 Like our minds have been blown.

861
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,940
 Like our lives have been touched in a drastic way and we can't help but talk about the things

862
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,040
 that we've seen and we've heard."

863
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:57,880
 Church, it is the thesis of my life that I believe that if you're in this room and you,

864
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,040
 you really love Jesus, not just an idea of it, like you really love Him, you're a follower

865
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,600
 of Him, then the only reason that you're still here on planet Earth is because God has left

866
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,440
 you with an assignment and a mission to carry into the world.

867
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,080
 Just real talk, let's think about this.

868
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,520
 Like if you love Jesus, like that moment that you push all the chips in, why not in that

869
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,680
 moment do you not get zapped up into heaven to be with Him?

870
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,440
 Like why not?

871
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,800
 Like think about this.

872
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,400
 That would be a much better deal than what we've got going on down here.

873
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:45,240
 Like as amazing as the porch is, and it's incredible, as amazing as the DFW area is,

874
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:56,000
 and to be in the throne room with King Jesus, to be fully known, to be fully loved, to be

875
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,920
 truly seen for who you are and completely accepted, no hurt, no pain, no cancer, no

876
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,600
 fear, no anxiety, no worry, no stress, like are you kidding me?

877
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,800
 That's a much better deal than what we've got going on down here.

878
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,600
 So why leave us here?

879
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,360
 Because He's not done.

880
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:28,400
 Because He rescued your heart and He sent you into the world motivated by everything

881
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,280
 that you've seen Him do in your life.

882
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,600
 Now, love, I've heard it said this way, the gospel just hit you on its way to someone

883
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
 else.

884
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:42,800
 But check this out, what if God so loves the people in your office space that He rescued

885
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,200
 and redeemed your heart and then He left you there so that you could share the gospel with

886
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
 Him?

887
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,640
 Because I love them so much that I'm not gonna pull you out.

888
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,480
 I'm gonna leave you there so that you can pass on that love, so that you can share that

889
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,240
 with them.

890
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
 Think about this.

891
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,960
 And once again, it's not about performance, it's not about duty.

892
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,800
 Like these men, like they were threatened with their lives and they go, "Hey, we can't

893
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,040
 help but speak about it."

894
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
 Think about Isaiah.

895
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
 Some of you may remember this story.

896
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,920
 In Isaiah chapter six, there's this moment where this very broken man comes face to face

897
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,080
 with the God of the universe.

898
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,640
 He sees Him, high lifted on His throne, and he goes, "Oh man, like I'm screwed up, like

899
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,480
 I'm messed up, I've got a lot of issues, like don't kill me."

900
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,340
 And God heals him, forgives him.

901
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:36,320
 And then God asks this question, "Who, who we send?

902
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,600
 Who's gonna go into the world and tell them about my goodness?

903
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
 Who's gonna tell them about my love?

904
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,360
 I have a rescue plan just for them."

905
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:53,760
 And if you ever go back to that passage, I want you to know what it doesn't say.

906
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,040
 Isaiah doesn't have a moment where he goes, he looks around and he's like, "Ah, I guess

907
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,400
 it's just me.

908
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,680
 I guess I'm the only Christian in the office.

909
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,720
 I guess I'm the only one in the social club that loves Jesus, so I guess, I guess me.

910
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
 I'll do it."

911
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
 No.

912
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,080
 There's, there's an exclamation point by the end of his statement where it's like he steps

913
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,160
 up to the plate and he goes, "No, no, no, no, God, here I am.

914
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
 Here I am.

915
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
 You send me.

916
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,640
 God, you could send anybody.

917
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,960
 Anybody could go, but I'm asking you, send me.

918
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,040
 God, I've seen your beauty.

919
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,840
 I've seen you to be a treasure that you promised to be.

920
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
 Like send me.

921
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
 I'll go.

922
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,040
 I'll tell the world.

923
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,480
 I'm motivated by what you've done for me, that you've rescued me.

924
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
 You've redeemed me.

925
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
 I was once an enemy.

926
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,800
 I was once a slave, but now I'm alive.

927
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
 I'm adopted.

928
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
 I'm your son.

929
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
 I'm your daughter.

930
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 Send me, please.

931
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,980
 You don't have to.

932
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:59,320
 You could send anybody, but God, you left me here and I want to tell them, I want to

933
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:06,120
 tell them, God, send me.

934
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:17,760
 A couple years ago, I was at an event much like this, and at the time I was just doing

935
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,560
 magic and I'm sitting in the back and watching people worship and I'm watching this gentleman

936
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,160
 just lose his mind.

937
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,720
 I mean, hands up, I mean, he's just going for it.

938
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
 Like no one else in the room.

939
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,080
 Like it was obvious.

940
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,120
 And so there was something stirring in me and this probably wasn't smart, but I just

941
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,160
 kind of walk over and I was like, hey, listen, I just kind of tap him on the shoulder.

942
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:50,160
 I'm like, hey, bro, I hate to bother you, but I need to know, what's the secret?

943
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,200
 And what's the secret?

944
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:04,480
 What is it that allows you to worship Jesus with such reckless abandonment?

945
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,320
 Like nobody else in the whole room.

946
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:20,160
 And all of a sudden, he responds this way, what do you mean I'm the only one in the room

947
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,240
 worshiping this way?

948
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,320
 It was in that moment that one of the moving lights swings across the audience and I notice

949
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,760
 that there's this massive glaze over his eyes.

950
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,400
 I go, man, I'm so sorry to ask, but are you blind?

951
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,440
 He's like, yeah.

952
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:49,120
 And it was in that moment that God dropped a message in my heart.

953
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:55,920
 This was a young man that maybe he couldn't see with his eyes, but his heart was fully

954
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,440
 open.

955
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,880
 For him, the message was so clear that God had rescued and redeemed a broken person just

956
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,880
 like him and adopted him into the family.

957
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,600
 For him, it was so obvious that he was marked by Christ, that he loved Jesus, not just in

958
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,160
 a moment, not just to sing a song, but the rest of his week, the rest of his month, the

959
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,320
 rest of his year was spent walking with Jesus.

960
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:24,000
 And it was obvious that he was motivated by what God had done in his life.

961
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,640
 Church, this is my prayer for each and every one of you.

962
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:41,600
 And maybe so, would you know that this is the life that Jesus invites you into?

963
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:46,120
 And would you know that he is absolutely worth it?

964
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,320
 He really is a treasure.

965
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,560
 He really is.

966
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,320
 He really is everything that he claims to be.

967
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:07,300
 Please don't spend all of your time playing church, playing Christianity, and missing

968
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,240
 the life that Jesus invites you into.

969
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:20,000
 Jesus, we love you.

970
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,920
 And Jesus, I have no idea the stories of the people in this room, but I know that you do.

971
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,240
 I know that you are good.

972
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,440
 I know that you love them.

973
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,160
 I know that you have a plan for them.

974
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,440
 I know that you're inviting them into something deeper.

975
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,520
 And so God, I pray that they wouldn't miss out on that.

976
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,080
 God, I pray that I wouldn't miss out on that.

977
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,560
 That I wouldn't get so busy playing the role of a Christian, playing the role of a pastor,

978
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,680
 that I miss out on the intimacy that you invite me into.

979
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,280
 So Jesus, for every person in this room, I pray tonight that they would walk out of this

980
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,040
 place with the message, with your message unbelievably clear in their heart.

981
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,200
 No matter where they land, no matter where they are spiritually, would the message be

982
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,160
 clear to them.

983
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,240
 God in the days to come, I pray that you would mark them with your presence, overwhelm them

984
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
 with your presence.

985
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:24,280
 And God, I pray that you would motivate them such at a deep level of what you've done for

986
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,280
 them.

987
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,440
 And then you would send them into the world to be agents of hope and reconciliation and

988
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,320
 change in this world.

989
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,280
 We love you, Jesus.

990
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
 We trust you.
