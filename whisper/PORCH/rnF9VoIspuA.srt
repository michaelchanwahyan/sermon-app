1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,560
 All right, what's up everybody in the room?

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,120
 Everybody tuning in wherever you're coming in from.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,920
 Porch Live locations, Porch Boise, Porch Indy,

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,320
 Porch Scottsdale, Tulsa, North Houston,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,120
 Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wherever you are listening,

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,200
 Des Moines, wherever you are tuning in from,

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
 we are continuing this series on Ephesians

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,840
 and looking at this book written by the Apostle Paul

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,440
 that lays out the Christian life and the new you.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,420
 When I was in college at Texas A&M,

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,200
 which is apparently where everyone else

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,040
 was in college in here,

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,560
 I had a chance to do track and field there.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,560
 And while I was there, I just was introduced to this team

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,760
 that I would be a part of, and I like threw the javelin,

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,120
 which is the least impressive of any sport that exists.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,800
 It's like you're throwing a spear and nobody does it,

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,880
 so there's no competition,

20
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,120
 so let's just get that out of the way.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,160
 But point being, you would have your entire world

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,920
 was around this team.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,700
 So where you would eat would be with all the other teammates

24
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,080
 that you would have and where you would sleep

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
 and the dorms that they would put you in

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,080
 would be with all the other track teammates

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
 that were a part of your team.

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,600
 And it was a really interesting group

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,400
 because if you have seen a track and field team,

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,680
 you know that because of the different events

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
 that are involved,

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,800
 that you have a really diverse group of people.

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,880
 Like you have a guy who is like 100 pounds soaking wet

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,480
 who runs the mile and he can just run with incredible speed

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,660
 and then he would be sitting at the dinner table

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,400
 when we'd all be eating next to a 300 pound shot put thrower

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,060
 that looked like he'd eaten three of those guys.

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,300
 And then you would have this guy,

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,180
 I mean, there was a guy,

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,220
 most athletic person I've ever met in my life.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
 His name was Tyler.

42
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,540
 He was a shot put thrower.

43
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,180
 The guys, this will mean something to you.

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,700
 Girls, you probably won't care.

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,420
 He ran a four, five and a 40.

46
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,460
 He was six foot seven, 280 pounds.

47
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,700
 He was recruited by the US bobsled team

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,260
 because he was so heavy and so fast.

49
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,380
 It was just unbelievable.

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,560
 And then you had next to him was this five eight,

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
 a guy named Fabrice.

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,640
 How cool is that name?

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,580
 Fabrice.

54
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,580
 And he was a long jumper that was like 110 pounds,

55
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,380
 but he could just fly and ended up going to the Olympics

56
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,880
 for doing long jump.

57
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,780
 And you just had this group of people,

58
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,760
 each with very different gifts

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,520
 and everybody stayed in their lane.

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,760
 In other words, the 300 pound shot put thrower

61
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
 was not like, you know what?

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,720
 I think I'm gonna go for the mile today.

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,680
 Let's give that a shot.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
 He knew I'm here to throw a big metal rock

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
 as far as possible.

66
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,080
 And then the guy who was running the mile

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,360
 knew that his role was not to try to jump over something

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,320
 or throw something.

69
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,840
 It was to run the mile.

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,920
 And the only way that our team would be successful

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,740
 is by working together and by each playing our part

72
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,480
 based on the gifting and ability

73
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,120
 that we brought to the table.

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,680
 Now, what does that have to do with the book of Ephesians?

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
 Well, tonight we're gonna look at a passage

76
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,000
 in Ephesians chapter four,

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,320
 where the apostle Paul is gonna say,

78
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,640
 if you want to experience and maximize

79
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,440
 all that God wants to do through your life,

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,980
 it's gonna involve you working

81
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,640
 and being a part of something with others,

82
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,040
 just like a team requires teammates working together.

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,020
 And it's gonna involve you contributing

84
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,500
 and playing your specific part.

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,960
 Just like a team in track has to work together

86
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,680
 in order to be successful and each play their role

87
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,680
 and each work together, so it is with the body of Christ.

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,120
 And what Paul's gonna lay out in these three ideas,

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,840
 we're gonna look at Ephesians chapter four,

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,640
 is really the recipe for how people grow in their faith.

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,200
 In other words, if you have been growing

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,120
 and experiencing spiritual growth in your life,

93
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,320
 it's directly a result

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
 of what Paul's gonna talk about here.

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,500
 And the flip side is also true.

96
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,840
 If you have been, maybe you trusted Christ at an early age

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,440
 and you've been around, but let's be honest,

98
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,080
 you've grown in years, but you haven't grown in your faith.

99
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,100
 And it's because of not applying

100
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,800
 and doing what Paul is gonna write

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,140
 to the church in Ephesus.

102
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,140
 This simple truth is one that has the potential

103
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,720
 to change the course and trajectory of your life.

104
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,360
 It has the potential and will, not just have the potential,

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,180
 it will shape the future you're gonna have,

106
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,520
 because it involves you being connected together

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,320
 and just like a track athlete working with a team,

108
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,640
 the body of Christ is to be in relationship with one another

109
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,080
 and in particular ways in order

110
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,840
 to be everything that God wants for you

111
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,520
 and everything that God wants to do through your life.

112
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,280
 And so we're gonna look in Ephesians chapter four,

113
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,560
 verse one through 16.

114
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,880
 I'm gonna start, I'm gonna read through it.

115
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
 If you've just joined us,

116
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,620
 we've been walking through the church

117
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,360
 of this letter to the church in Ephesus.

118
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,280
 Ephesus was a port city in modern day Turkey.

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,100
 You could go there today, it's beautiful,

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
 it has the climate of LA, it was a very wealthy city.

121
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,900
 It had incredible blue water right in front of it.

122
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,100
 It was a place where people wanted to live,

123
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,100
 incredibly influential city, and Paul loved this city.

124
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,500
 And so he spent as much time in that city

125
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,700
 as almost any other church that he worked with.

126
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,220
 And he's sitting in a prison cell around 60 AD,

127
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,460
 and he writes this letter to the church in Ephesus.

128
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,840
 And the first three chapters is just Paul going off

129
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,800
 about all that you have in Christ.

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
 In other words, he doesn't get to any,

131
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,780
 and here's what you do for the first three chapters.

132
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,240
 He's just going, "Before the foundation of the world,

133
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,360
 "God had the gospel and you in mind.

134
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,940
 "And in Christ, when you trusted Jesus

135
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,880
 "as the Lord and Savior of your life,"

136
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
 what does that mean?

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,380
 When you trusted Jesus, you on the cross,

138
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,360
 you paid for all of my sin, past, present, future.

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,640
 And you came back alive, showing that payment was enough.

140
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,880
 That's what it means to be a Christian.

141
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,120
 When that happened, and he just goes off

142
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,000
 for three beautiful, amazing chapters

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
 about all that God has done.

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,280
 And then in chapter four, he takes a turn

145
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
 and begins to go, "So in light of that,

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,400
 "here is now how you live out the Christian life."

147
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,680
 And he brings up the idea of walking.

148
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
 So the first three chapters are all about

149
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
 the wealth you have in Christ.

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,360
 The next two are about the walk we now live out in Christ.

151
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
 And we're gonna look at that tonight.

152
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,440
 And I'm gonna start in verse one of chapter four.

153
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,880
 "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord,

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,420
 "therefore in light of all that God has done for you,

155
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,740
 "in light of you being sealed for all of eternity,

156
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,740
 "you are a new creation, urge you to walk in a manner

157
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,040
 "worthy of the calling to which you have been called."

158
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,580
 He sets up a big statement, says,

159
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,780
 "In light of all that God has done for you."

160
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,900
 "I am urging you to walk in a manner worthy

161
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,720
 "of the calling you've received."

162
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
 The new life that you have.

163
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,380
 The Greek word worthy that he uses is a Greek word

164
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,800
 that would be used oftentimes for a weight on a scale.

165
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 He's saying, "You should live in a way that proportionally

166
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,740
 "is equal to the amazing things,

167
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,100
 "the new life that you have been given in Christ.

168
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,780
 "And I'm urging you to live in light of,

169
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,800
 "or consistent with the amazing life

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
 "that you have in Christ."

171
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,840
 In other words, if your Christian life looks like this,

172
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
 God has done all these amazing things,

173
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,640
 but it has no impact on your life,

174
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,200
 he's saying, "You're not living in proportion

175
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,040
 "to what God has done."

176
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,920
 He's saying, "People should look at your life,"

177
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,260
 in other words, and they see that, man, they're different.

178
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,000
 And if they find out, it's 'cause they're a Christian,

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,080
 they would go, "Oh, well that makes sense."

180
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,840
 That in other words, if people look at your life

181
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,300
 and they go, "Wait, they're a Christian?

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,480
 "They don't look any different than anybody else."

183
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,160
 And Paul's saying, "Hey, you and I,

184
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,820
 "and this new life in Christ,

185
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,820
 "are to live in proportion and consistent with the new you."

186
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,880
 And then he lists out what that looks like.

187
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,200
 And where he goes is interesting,

188
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,960
 because you would think, what's he gonna say?

189
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,620
 Hey, live with the new you.

190
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,000
 Memorize the whole New Testament.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,240
 Spend hours each day in prayer.

192
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,440
 Pick up everything and move to a foreign country

193
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,220
 and be a missionary.

194
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,320
 None of those are bad things, but it's not where he goes.

195
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,600
 He then turns to you all together,

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,100
 and he says this in verse two.

197
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,600
 Here's how to live consistent and worthy

198
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
 with the calling you have in Christ.

199
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,960
 Live with humility and gentleness,

200
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,960
 with patience, bearing with one another in love,

201
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,600
 eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit

202
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,120
 in the bond of peace.

203
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,520
 That Paul sets up this big statement,

204
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,040
 "And I, in light of three chapters

205
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,780
 "and all that God has done and the amazing work

206
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,160
 "on the cross that has been accomplished,

207
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,960
 "I am urging you to live in light of all of that."

208
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,200
 And then he brings up by getting along.

209
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,080
 I mean, it's this big statement followed by,

210
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,240
 "I want you to bear with one another."

211
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
 And it literally is a translation

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,400
 for to get along with one another,

213
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,120
 to put up with each other.

214
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,440
 And why would that be so important?

215
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,280
 Because Paul knew that his day was much like our day,

216
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,280
 that often Christians and humanity in general

217
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,320
 is not known for getting along and for being united

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,480
 and for being for one another, and we can disagree,

219
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,560
 but I still love you.

220
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,320
 That we live in a world that, man, if you cross me,

221
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
 then we're done, or this is over,

222
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
 or you hurt me, and I'm out.

223
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,640
 And he's saying, "I want you to be diligent

224
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,280
 "to fight for unity of the Spirit."

225
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,720
 And then he brings up all the different ways

226
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,680
 that you and I are to be one, just as God is one.

227
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
 He says, "There's one body and one Spirit,

228
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,840
 "is in the Holy Spirit.

229
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,740
 "You were called to one hope that belongs to your call.

230
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,140
 "There's one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

231
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,700
 "one God and Father of all, who's over all

232
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,600
 "and through all and in all."

233
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,120
 He's saying, "I am urging you to fight for unity."

234
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,800
 The first idea Paul brings up is if you wanna follow Jesus,

235
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
 if you wanna be all that God wants you to be,

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
 it involves you and other believers in your life together,

237
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
 and specifically fighting for unity together.

238
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,600
 And when somebody hurts you, you don't run from it,

239
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,220
 you bear with them and you seek to forgive them,

240
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,600
 and you seek to fight to move towards one another,

241
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 just like God and Christ, despite our sin against Him,

242
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
 move towards us.

243
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,860
 And now as Christians, Paul says,

244
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,080
 "Hey, you and I are to move towards one another."

245
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,080
 And he uses the word be diligent, as in work hard at it.

246
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
 It should be a constant thing

247
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,900
 that you and your relationships, and me and my relationships,

248
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,760
 how do you know if you're experiencing the will of God?

249
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,600
 You ready?

250
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,820
 Here's one of the ways.

251
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,980
 How do you know if you're living in line

252
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,200
 with the Spirit of God?

253
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
 If you're a Christian, you have the Spirit of God.

254
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,240
 How do you know if you're living in line with it?

255
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,640
 The Spirit of God is always moving towards unity.

256
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,080
 If you are moving away from unity and towards division,

257
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,240
 you're living in light of a spirit,

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,840
 but it's not the Spirit of God.

259
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,560
 He says that, "As believers, I am calling you now

260
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,160
 "to fight for unity and to be diligent,"

261
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,580
 as in it's gonna take work.

262
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,520
 You know what the reality,

263
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,920
 we talk about community groups here all the time,

264
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,720
 how you gotta get connected

265
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,180
 and you gotta have other believers in your life.

266
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,440
 If you haven't taken that step,

267
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
 let me remove a mystery for you.

268
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,400
 The day that you take that step,

269
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,640
 you're gonna step more towards what God's designed

270
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,020
 for relationships and transformation,

271
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,280
 but you're also gonna take a step, you ready?

272
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,220
 For headaches and frustrations

273
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,800
 and things that rub you the wrong way

274
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,880
 or don't always go perfectly how you would.

275
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
 You know why?

276
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,600
 Because you're moving in the direction of other people.

277
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
 And you know what people have in common?

278
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,900
 They're all messed up, just like you.

279
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,000
 And so the reason, I don't know,

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,400
 a community group at Watermark,

281
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,440
 and I've been one eight years, amazing,

282
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,720
 and there's times where you're just gonna have conflict

283
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
 and Paul's saying, "Hey, you have got to fight."

284
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 There's no varsity level you reach as a Christian

285
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,600
 where, hey, you no longer have to fight to be unified.

286
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 It just comes easy.

287
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 That doesn't happen.

288
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,720
 And Paul says, "For the rest of your life,

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,720
 "you're gonna have to fight to be united."

290
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,560
 Fight for unity.

291
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,200
 It's like this, every summer,

292
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,880
 the same thing happens in my front lawn.

293
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,660
 Weeds will grow up and I'll have to go out there

294
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,160
 and I'll have to pick them out.

295
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,600
 And then the next summer will come.

296
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,060
 And you know what happens again?

297
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,040
 Weeds will come up in my lawn.

298
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,800
 You know what didn't happen in between those two occasions

299
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
 where I removed them and the next summer came

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,760
 and they were back again?

301
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,180
 I didn't go out in my front yard

302
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,800
 and get a bunch of weed seed and be like,

303
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,260
 "Here, put some over here and put some over here."

304
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,120
 They just popped up because it's a byproduct

305
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,600
 of having a lawn.

306
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,560
 It comes with the territory.

307
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,820
 And a byproduct of working with people

308
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,160
 is that there's gonna be conflicts and offenses and hurts.

309
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,040
 And as believers, we're not naive,

310
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,280
 pretending that doesn't happen.

311
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,600
 We fight for unity because we know it will happen.

312
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,140
 It comes with the territory.

313
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,880
 And candidly, let me just bring you into my world.

314
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,040
 This is something that, like,

315
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,920
 when I say it never goes away,

316
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,200
 I mean it never goes away for myself very much included.

317
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,760
 I mean, I had to move different meetings today

318
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,960
 because of hurts that I had caused with somebody on my team

319
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,840
 that was not intentional but was still a miss

320
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
 completely for me.

321
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,040
 Had to move into conversations

322
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,480
 where I negatively interpreted something

323
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,120
 and had to say, "Man, hey, here's the things

324
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,160
 "that I am thinking about that situation."

325
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,140
 It doesn't go away.

326
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,620
 And I can either choose to sit on that,

327
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,040
 pretend it, stuff it, act like everything's fine,

328
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,240
 or I can piece fake,

329
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,240
 or I can piece make by running towards that situation.

330
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,120
 And that looks like me asking for forgiveness

331
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,000
 for ways that I've offended, not just today, anytime.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 And vice versa, and fighting for unity, not uniformity.

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,200
 You can disagree, like we can debate as Christians,

334
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,120
 but we are not to be divided.

335
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,120
 I mean, this is a message that especially right now

336
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,460
 with elections, just the craziness of the world

337
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,100
 that we as Christians are called,

338
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,660
 as much as anything else, anybody else,

339
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,500
 we don't cancel people.

340
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,420
 We fight for people 'cause we fight for unity.

341
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,140
 And how do you know if you're living in God's will

342
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,460
 if you are living in relationship with other people

343
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,440
 where you are fighting for unity,

344
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,000
 not to be right, not to win, but to be united?

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,540
 And Paul says, if you wanna experience

346
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,060
 what God's design and purpose and call for your life,

347
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,580
 it's gonna involve you living in that way together.

348
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,180
 Later in the same chapter, he says this,

349
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,060
 "In your anger, do not let the sun go down

350
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,860
 "while you are still angry."

351
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,680
 The rest of the verse says,

352
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,740
 "Do not give the devil a foothold inside of your life."

353
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,500
 That you and I are to fight to keep short accounts.

354
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,180
 The point of the verse is not, hey, if you're angry

355
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,700
 and you go to bed, you're insane, he's saying,

356
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,700
 no, you should move quickly when somebody's hurt you

357
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,580
 towards that person,

358
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,940
 especially if they're a brother and sister in Christ.

359
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,220
 We did an entire message on this

360
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,280
 in anti-suppressants a couple months ago,

361
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,300
 so I'm not gonna go at length here,

362
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,700
 but the scriptures give us a real clear path

363
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,820
 to fight for unity.

364
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,820
 The Matthew 18 passage that Jesus teaches on forgiving

365
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,980
 gives the clearest instruction, which says,

366
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,780
 hey, if your brother sins against you,

367
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,420
 you go to him in private.

368
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,700
 So they sin, they hurt you, they do something,

369
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,420
 you go to them in private.

370
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,260
 If they don't listen,

371
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,240
 then you go to them with someone else.

372
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,580
 If they still don't listen,

373
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,820
 then you widen the circle only as is necessary,

374
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,380
 not for the purpose of shaming them or paying them back,

375
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,380
 but moving them back into relationship,

376
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,140
 to being reconciled with other believers.

377
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,780
 That we only talk to people who are a part of the problem

378
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,940
 or a part of the solution.

379
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,740
 In other words, man, if somebody in your life

380
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,020
 has frustrated you, you are not fighting for unity

381
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,420
 if you just put them on blast on social media.

382
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,260
 If somebody in your life has offended you,

383
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,620
 maybe this is a more common way,

384
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,980
 you're not fighting for unity

385
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,380
 if when you go to your community group,

386
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,020
 your small group or your church group,

387
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,620
 and underneath the banner of prayer requests,

388
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,820
 you talk gossip, which is incredibly common

389
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,340
 of going, hey guys, yeah, hard week.

390
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,780
 I think we should all pray for Stephanie.

391
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,700
 I mean, clearly there's something wrong with her.

392
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,140
 She's back with that guy and we could really use prayer.

393
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,140
 Or Kyle, I mean, we should pray for him.

394
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,380
 His heart, did you see the car?

395
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,000
 I think he's leasing that car.

396
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,260
 Clearly materialistic.

397
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
 We need to just cover him in prayer.

398
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,100
 It's gossip.

399
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,540
 And it's not fighting for unity.

400
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:04,700
 And the scripture commands that it's not an option.

401
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,940
 If there is someone in your life right now

402
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,700
 that has hurt you, that is a believer, listen to me.

403
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,620
 You are commanded to move towards that person,

404
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,860
 to fight for unity with them.

405
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,580
 If they've hurt you, maybe if you just feel like,

406
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,540
 man, they're just off and you guys just got beef,

407
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,940
 like, can't believe some of y'all come down front,

408
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,780
 and I can like sense the tension between you

409
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,380
 and it's like, there's something wrong with y'all.

410
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,500
 Like, have y'all ever talked about this?

411
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,140
 And you're like, yeah, well,

412
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,380
 can we talk in private for a second?

413
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,360
 And then they bring it up and there's all these hurts

414
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,960
 that they may even be willing to share just with me,

415
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,520
 but they haven't shared with that person

416
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,620
 and that's not consistent with the faith that you have.

417
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,860
 So Paul says, hey, if you wanna live out your calling,

418
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,620
 it involves living with other people in relationship

419
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,020
 and moving towards that person.

420
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,300
 Jesus is, one of the last prayers he prayed was,

421
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,180
 "Father, I pray for the unity among your people.

422
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,080
 "I pray that they would be united

423
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,060
 "and there is an enemy who hates this."

424
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,900
 He wants to do everything he can right now

425
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,780
 to tell you why you are justified in your hurt

426
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,940
 and it's their fault.

427
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,620
 They need to be the one who's moving towards you,

428
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
 not you towards them.

429
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,400
 You've already done enough, they've hurt you.

430
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,880
 He wants you to stay there.

431
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
 You know that, right?

432
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,000
 So when you hear that voice going off,

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
 or you hear it's not that big of a deal,

434
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,360
 or man, I'm just gonna turn to the other side

435
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,000
 and you dismiss the ability to step towards unity,

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,920
 you are not listening to the spirit of God.

437
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,780
 And there's an enemy, he wants his offense.

438
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,880
 Satan's offense is division.

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,660
 He wants to destroy your community groups,

440
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,960
 your relationships, your family relationships.

441
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
 He wants to do everything he can to box you into that hurt

442
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,740
 and box you into how it's all their problems,

443
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,400
 rather than saying, "I am going to treat them

444
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,640
 "not how they treated me,

445
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
 "but how God and Christ treated me,"

446
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,740
 and move towards them.

447
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,740
 Second thing Paul goes into also involves

448
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,080
 working together with other people.

449
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 He says, "To each one of us, grace has been given

450
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,320
 "as Christ apportioned or distributed it."

451
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,120
 This is why it says, and he quotes a Psalm,

452
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,040
 when Jesus ascended on high,

453
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,240
 he set captives free, or took many captives,

454
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,200
 and he gave gifts to people, that God in Christ,

455
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,500
 when you became a believer, he gave spiritual gifts.

456
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,040
 So Christ gave himself, and he lists out various gifts.

457
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,420
 He gave apostles, those are the ones

458
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,440
 who wrote the New Testament.

459
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,560
 Then he gave people who spoke prophetically

460
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,200
 or brought forth truth, evangelists,

461
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,720
 the gift of evangelism, pastors and teachers

462
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,640
 to equip his people for the works of service,

463
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,840
 that God gave out spiritual gifts

464
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
 so that the body of Christ, verse 12,

465
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,320
 "may be built up."

466
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,160
 Second thing that Paul says,

467
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,240
 if you wanna live out your calling,

468
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,560
 it's gonna involve using the spiritual gifts

469
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,600
 God has given you.

470
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,480
 So it involves fighting for unity

471
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,920
 and fulfilling your gifting,

472
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,640
 that you are gonna live and serve

473
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,040
 with the spiritual gifts that God has given you,

474
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,240
 'cause here's the truth.

475
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,020
 The Bible says in 1 Corinthians chapter 12,

476
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,920
 Romans chapter 12, 1 Peter chapter four,

477
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,500
 Ephesians chapter four, it says,

478
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,320
 "God, when you became a believer,

479
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
 "spiritual gifts were given to you."

480
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,440
 And it lists out, they're all throughout the scriptures.

481
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,680
 You can go to watermark.org, type in spiritual gift tests,

482
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,000
 and you can take a test that will tell you

483
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,680
 some of the spiritual gifts that you have.

484
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,680
 In addition to taking one of those tests,

485
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,420
 you've gotta use that gift.

486
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,780
 And when you do, you begin to see,

487
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,760
 man, it's like you come alive when you do that.

488
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
 Maybe you have the gift of evangelism

489
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,760
 and just sharing your faith,

490
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,840
 it just like, you come alive

491
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,720
 and it just comes easier than other people.

492
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,360
 Maybe you have the gift of teaching,

493
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,440
 and for you, you serve and you lead a small group

494
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,960
 of high school, junior high students,

495
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,680
 and it's like something just on the inside,

496
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
 it just comes alive,

497
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,960
 where you have the gift of leadership.

498
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
 That's another one of the gifts

499
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,960
 in Romans 12, as mentioned.

500
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,240
 And people around you, and they just affirm,

501
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,880
 they're like, you've always been a leader.

502
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,920
 You've always have been a leader.

503
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,480
 Or the gift of administration,

504
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,320
 like details and administering and putting on things.

505
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,240
 It just comes naturally to you

506
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,960
 in ways that is foreign to so many of us.

507
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,840
 I don't know what it is for you,

508
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,340
 but I know that when you became a believer,

509
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,580
 God entrusted you with spiritual gifts

510
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,040
 that he gave to build his church.

511
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,180
 Do you know your gifts?

512
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,840
 Are you using your gifts?

513
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,200
 At Christmas time, we'll have different family

514
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,280
 that lives out of state,

515
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,120
 and they'll mail presents for my kids.

516
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,780
 And I'll get a big box that will arrive,

517
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,920
 and inside of the box will be different presents

518
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,880
 that are to be opened up Christmas morning for my kids.

519
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
 So my six-year-old, he'll get like a Nerf gun,

520
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,280
 or my daughter, some like pony princess,

521
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,240
 and our eight-month-old, he's just happy to be here.

522
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,120
 But they'll get these different gifts,

523
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,880
 and they're given with the intention,

524
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 not of me keeping them,

525
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,880
 but of giving them to my kids.

526
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,600
 And just like it would be messed up,

527
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,540
 and weird, and you would think I'm a bad father

528
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,520
 if the gifts that I got given,

529
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,100
 I didn't actually pass on to them,

530
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,900
 I just kept them, you know, I really like Nerf guns,

531
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,980
 and I've always wanted a pony,

532
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,380
 and so I'm keeping all these for me.

533
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,940
 You go, man, that's really messed up.

534
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,900
 God is saying, I gave you spiritual gifts

535
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,240
 for the purpose of building up the church,

536
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,700
 not building out your resume,

537
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,060
 not building your business,

538
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,940
 not building some future preferred destination

539
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,300
 of what life will look like someday,

540
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,500
 none of which are bad things,

541
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,020
 but if they come at the exclusion

542
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,700
 of you using the spiritual gifts

543
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,160
 that God said I gave those gifts,

544
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,280
 not for you, but to be passed through you.

545
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,120
 And if you wanna experience your calling,

546
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,440
 it involves fulfilling your gifting.

547
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,600
 God made you unique.

548
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,780
 You have a unique story, a unique wiring,

549
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,920
 and unique skill sets that I don't have.

550
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,220
 And he's saying, hey, are you gonna use those

551
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,700
 to be gifts that I'm giving not to you,

552
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,880
 but through you, 'cause that's what spiritual gifts are for,

553
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 for the building up of the church.

554
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,860
 There are so many leaders, candidly,

555
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,780
 we are spoiled at the porch with the amazing men and women

556
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,660
 that Josiah and Kendall lead every single week,

557
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,780
 the 200 men and women who put on the porch,

558
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,700
 the porch leaders, that I see this firsthand

559
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,220
 in the way that they live.

560
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,580
 And the stories, I could go on for hours

561
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
 of just men and women,

562
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,620
 and you know what they've got a vision for?

563
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,460
 And it doesn't have to be here.

564
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,700
 It can be in any different arena,

565
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,020
 in lots of ministries in the city,

566
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,660
 in lots of places, in lots of opportunities here every week,

567
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,200
 but it's just men and women who've caught a vision for,

568
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,000
 I believe the Bible is true.

569
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Jesus is real.

570
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,920
 He's coming back.

571
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,060
 Eternity is long.

572
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,120
 Hell is real.

573
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,000
 And I wanna use my gifts and the way God has made me

574
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,360
 for the short window called life that I have.

575
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,600
 And they, week after week,

576
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
 and they see those gifts just come alive.

577
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
 I think of my friend Ryan.

578
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,800
 We do this three-day in-town mission trip

579
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,040
 called Unashamed.

580
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,160
 And it's birthed out of basically a passion

581
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,480
 and a gift of evangelism.

582
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,100
 And he said, "Man, I wanna see young adults

583
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,340
 "learn how to share their faith."

584
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,780
 And so we started doing these three-day

585
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,940
 in-town mission trips where we train them

586
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,280
 on how to go share their faith.

587
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,620
 And then we'd partner with local ministries

588
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,100
 inside of Dallas where there is desperate need

589
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,840
 for people to come and just paint houses

590
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,980
 and mow lawns of widows and care for people

591
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,780
 in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.

592
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,680
 And to be a light in a city that is full of darkness,

593
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,440
 just like every city that's tuning in right now

594
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,420
 is full of darkness.

595
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,820
 And God has you where he does for you to use your gifts

596
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,740
 and to serve him.

597
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,940
 And frankly, I hope every one of you

598
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,740
 emails southdallas@watermark.org.

599
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,800
 If you're listening online, you missed that announcement,

600
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,860
 but there's an opportunity October 30th

601
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,300
 from one to 7 p.m. for you to use your gifts

602
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,820
 and just serve and to care for some of the least of these.

603
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,820
 Or you can watch the Cowboys probably lose.

604
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,220
 (congregation laughing)

605
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,060
 And I hope they win.

606
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,540
 I got Dak on my fantasy football team,

607
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,660
 which is not a great thing right now.

608
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,420
 But point is, what are you gonna do?

609
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,700
 It's a one time a year thing.

610
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,980
 If we don't have that thing filled,

611
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,500
 Marvin, I'm embarrassed if we don't have that thing filled.

612
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,260
 Out of 3,000 people, we can't fill out 200?

613
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,660
 And whether it's that weekend or in general,

614
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,460
 are you using your gifts?

615
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,140
 'Cause the truth is, part of the spiritual life is,

616
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,580
 man, if you only breathe in and you never breathe out,

617
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,940
 something happens.

618
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,820
 You die.

619
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,580
 And if you only take in and you come here

620
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,940
 and you consume every single week,

621
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,460
 well, you never contribute.

622
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,160
 Your spiritual life is not growing, it's dying.

623
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,700
 There's an old Oklahoma football coach

624
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,660
 who coached the Sooners,

625
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,060
 and he was describing what football is.

626
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,940
 And he said, "Football is a game played

627
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,940
 "by 22 men on the field, desperately in need of rest,

628
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,920
 "being watched by 50,000 people in the stands,

629
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,160
 "desperately in need of exercise."

630
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
 (audience laughing)

631
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
 And there's so few doing so much,

632
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,920
 while so many just watch.

633
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,880
 And what a tragic thing,

634
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,960
 that in the church, that's often the case.

635
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,320
 There are so few doing so much, while so many just watch.

636
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,580
 And the reason it's tragic is not for the so many,

637
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,760
 because the so few need them,

638
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,480
 it's because the so many who are not using their gifts

639
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,900
 and they show up and they consume,

640
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,000
 they are missing out

641
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,580
 on seeing God use their life,

642
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,140
 on investing in something that actually matters.

643
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,860
 Maybe for you, you consider serving,

644
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,220
 and you join those 200 volunteers,

645
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,260
 and we will train you on how to share the gospel,

646
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,380
 how to engage inside of our city.

647
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,640
 And you sign up and go to the Porch app,

648
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,260
 like our app on the App Store, online, on your phone,

649
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,820
 use the application, you can go sign up

650
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,380
 and be a part of that, and go through 10 weeks

651
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,340
 led by some amazing men and women.

652
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,220
 I don't know where it is, I do know that God has said,

653
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,260
 "You have got to use the gifts He has entrusted to you

654
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,020
 "if you wanna grow, if you wanna mature.

655
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,720
 "And if not, you're not growing.

656
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,040
 "You're not thriving.

657
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,040
 "Your spiritual life is stagnant or dying."

658
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,040
 Finally, he says, "When we do this,

659
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,320
 "and we fight for unity together,

660
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,540
 "and then we seek to use the God-given gifts

661
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,540
 "that He's given you, something begins to happen.

662
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,140
 "Until we all reach unity in the faith

663
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,260
 "and knowledge in the Son of God, and become mature,

664
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,520
 "attaining the whole measure or the fullness of Christ.

665
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,020
 "So then, we will no longer be infants."

666
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,500
 Hey, when we're fighting for unity relationally together,

667
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,340
 when we're serving and existing connected to a body,

668
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,060
 when we're serving with our gifts,

669
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,540
 then we are no longer infants.

670
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,940
 We grow up, we mature.

671
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,540
 We're no longer infants tossed to and fro by the waves,

672
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,140
 blown here and there with every wind of teaching.

673
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,580
 Instead, speaking the truth in love,

674
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,660
 we will grow up to become, in every respect, mature.

675
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,760
 A mature body of Christ.

676
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,180
 Of Him that is the head, that is Christ.

677
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,420
 That Paul says, "Hey, when you begin to do this,

678
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,020
 "maturity begins to happen, and you begin to grow,

679
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,760
 "and your spiritual life begins to grow.

680
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,420
 "When you're connected with other people."

681
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,220
 The third idea, I have to walk you through it, man.

682
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,300
 We fight for unity, we fulfill your gifting.

683
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,360
 If you wanna live out your calling,

684
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,060
 it also involves you forging real community.

685
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,420
 You cannot grow and you will not grow.

686
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,900
 You will not have maturity without community.

687
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,860
 What's community?

688
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,900
 It's our word to describe authentic relationships.

689
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,400
 So you call it whatever you want to,

690
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,060
 but a small group, if you're a Christian,

691
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,020
 of men, if you're a man, of women,

692
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,500
 if you're a woman who know you,

693
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 they know where you're struggling,

694
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,860
 they come alongside and they pray for you,

695
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,700
 they support you when you go through hard times,

696
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,380
 they're financially caring for you,

697
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,020
 maybe you're in a rough position, and they come alongside,

698
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,340
 and they are God's provision and protection in your life.

699
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,300
 And if you wanna live out and experience your calling,

700
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,180
 it involves forging your community,

701
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,300
 or forging godly community.

702
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,500
 Why do I say forging?

703
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 'Cause there's a myth that, man,

704
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,020
 if I just could find the right group,

705
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,100
 then everything would be easy,

706
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,660
 and the hills are alive with the sound of music,

707
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,880
 and that's not true.

708
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,960
 Every group is gonna take work in fighting for unity

709
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,200
 and forming relationships.

710
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,000
 This is why we hammer the importance

711
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,560
 of being a member of a church,

712
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,040
 because if you wanna grow, and this is the reason,

713
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,520
 man, some of you guys, you trusted Christ

714
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,020
 at like a church camp 14 years ago,

715
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,120
 seven years ago, three years ago.

716
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,160
 You came to faith and grew up in a Christian home,

717
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,440
 and you've grown 10 years older,

718
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,640
 but your faith has not grown at all.

719
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,400
 And the reason is because you have not gotten connected

720
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,720
 to the body, and the verses we just read said

721
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 it's in connection to the body that you and I grow, mature.

722
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,900
 This is the reason why your faith has not grown,

723
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,360
 because you have not got connected

724
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,540
 and been a part of the body of Christ.

725
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,640
 My son, his name's Bear, he's eight months old,

726
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,380
 and this past week was a big week for him.

727
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,940
 Here he is, hanging out at the house,

728
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,940
 learned to crawl, and that's one of the pictures of it.

729
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,000
 And it was a big moment.

730
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,740
 When you're eight month old, begins to crawl,

731
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,120
 it's honestly kind of got pluses and minuses,

732
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,960
 because prior to that, you could just set him down,

733
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
 and you could go somewhere,

734
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,600
 and you knew exactly where he was gonna be,

735
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,280
 and now he's mobile.

736
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,440
 And so he is able to move and walk around

737
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,320
 and swallow things like his sister's little car there,

738
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,120
 and it just creates a new challenge.

739
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,480
 But when you're eight months old, that's awesome.

740
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,880
 You're learning to crawl.

741
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,180
 How weird and creepy would it be if he was eight years old,

742
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,580
 and all he did was crawl?

743
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,020
 I mean, it's a silly illustration, but think about it.

744
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,320
 You show up, you see an eight month old crawling,

745
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,020
 and you're like, oh, all of you just did it.

746
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,920
 You were like, aw.

747
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,280
 You see an eight year old crawling,

748
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,480
 there's something wrong.

749
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,800
 Because you're going, what?

750
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,200
 You haven't learned to walk?

751
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,280
 And yet spiritually, that's the case for a lot of people.

752
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,780
 Like you've been a spiritual infant,

753
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,200
 and I'm not mad at you.

754
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,940
 I have nothing invested in seeing anything,

755
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,680
 but you experience more of God's love,

756
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,340
 goodness, protection, freedom.

757
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,880
 But you've been a spiritual infant for 10 years.

758
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,280
 You're still a spiritual toddler in diapers.

759
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,920
 And you haven't grown, and the reason why

760
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,320
 is because you're not connected to other believers.

761
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,000
 You've been church hopping for the last three years,

762
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,800
 and you still think like, oh, we just moved to Dallas.

763
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,520
 You've been church hopping and church dating

764
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,720
 in different cities around the country

765
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
 underneath the banner of, man, I'm still checking it out,

766
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,360
 and I go here on Sundays, and I go here on Tuesdays.

767
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,080
 And as long as you do that,

768
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,960
 let me tell you what Paul says you're delaying.

769
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,040
 As long as you decide, man, someday I'm not ready,

770
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,760
 I'm going to, I'm still looking.

771
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,320
 As long as you're still looking, you are still delaying

772
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,080
 you maturing in your faith.

773
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,880
 'Cause Paul says it is by being connected

774
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,720
 to other believers, serving and using your gifts,

775
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,640
 that your faith grows and that you personally grow.

776
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,680
 This is why the language of, man, I love Jesus,

777
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,120
 I don't like the church, is so foolish.

778
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,040
 Because one, Jesus would say,

779
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,520
 the church is the bride of Christ.

780
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,120
 I love the church, Jesus would say so much, I died for her.

781
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,640
 And you think about even that idea of,

782
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,040
 what fiance would be okay with you

783
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,120
 insulting his bride like that?

784
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,320
 I mean, that's exactly what you're saying,

785
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,680
 if you're like, hey, I like Jesus,

786
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,520
 I just don't like the church,

787
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,800
 that's like going up to a guy and be like,

788
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
 look, bro, I like you, it's your girl,

789
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,840
 got a big problem with her.

790
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,280
 It'd be like, what, who's okay with that?

791
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,320
 Who's like, yeah, me too, man, best, bro, let's go.

792
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,720
 You'd be like, man, that is dysfunctional.

793
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,000
 Jesus says, I love my bride so much, I died for her.

794
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,280
 And there is clear or confident church hurt

795
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,440
 that is represented in this room.

796
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,920
 But that's not an excuse for you to say,

797
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,760
 because of that hurt, and I bet it was real,

798
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,720
 and I'm sorry that it happened,

799
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,040
 for you to say, I'm gonna continue to not mature

800
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,680
 and I'm not gonna grow in my faith.

801
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,360
 I'll stay a spiritual toddler when he's saying,

802
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,760
 this is the means by which you grow.

803
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,320
 And let me just press a little bit further.

804
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,040
 If you are dating someone

805
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,040
 and they're not connected to a church, that's concerning.

806
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,960
 And there may be a whole story, I'm sure,

807
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,120
 but here's another way of saying it.

808
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,360
 If you're dating somebody

809
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,040
 and they still are dating churches,

810
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,880
 and they've been dating,

811
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,080
 and they've been dating for like 18 months,

812
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,560
 they're still, if they are dating churches

813
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,160
 for that long of amount of time,

814
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,300
 they probably shouldn't be dating you.

815
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,200
 Because they're not connected.

816
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,320
 They've already shown, man, I really don't make commitments.

817
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,100
 And the Bible commands I am to be under the authority

818
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,720
 of elders, connected to a church that comes along,

819
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,160
 not to control me, to care for me,

820
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,080
 to be a place where I can pour out and use my gifts

821
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,520
 and make an impact in the places where God has us.

822
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,640
 And they're saying, no.

823
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,600
 And you're basically saying,

824
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,760
 I will continue to date someone who is telling God,

825
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,840
 I'm putting growing personally

826
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,600
 and maturing in my faith on hold.

827
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,160
 That's at least concerning.

828
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,140
 And it's definitely confusing.

829
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:49,860
 And so are you connected to a church, plugged in?

830
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,080
 It doesn't have to be this one.

831
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,920
 Say all the time,

832
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,140
 we're not interested in stealing Christians.

833
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,720
 We want you to experience what God has for you

834
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,980
 and go deeper into a church,

835
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,240
 to be connected with other people.

836
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,200
 And when that's not happening,

837
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,080
 you are missing out on growing in Christ.

838
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,720
 So in conclusion, as believers,

839
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,160
 to live out a calling, it involves fighting for unity,

840
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,560
 it involves fulfilling our gifting.

841
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,800
 God gave you gifts to use and not sit on the sidelines

842
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,400
 and then forge community to fight for.

843
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
 I'm gonna invite the band up

844
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,760
 and I'm gonna introduce you guys to some people

845
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,700
 that I did something similar at Awaken,

846
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,820
 but I want you guys to introduce,

847
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,380
 especially those of you who are online,

848
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,380
 some of the most gifted, fun, godly people

849
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,560
 that I get to work with every single week

850
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,780
 and Hayden and the band that are coming out here.

851
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,260
 So let me introduce some of these guys

852
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,620
 and they'll help illustrate something.

853
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,060
 This is Hayden Browning.

854
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,120
 You guys know Hayden?

855
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,680
 Every week, leads us in worship, put it up, Hayden.

856
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:43,420
 Jesse over here on the drums, Estaban playing bass,

857
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,820
 Wellington at guitar, Jacob guitar,

858
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,780
 my boy Adam Prince over here.

859
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,420
 Every week, you know what they do?

860
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,320
 Yeah, you can get excited.

861
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,340
 Every week, if you're in Ports Live,

862
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,780
 you probably haven't met these guys.

863
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,500
 They lead us every single week in worship.

864
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,820
 And you know what each of them have in common?

865
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,220
 They each have a different instrument

866
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,700
 and they each bring something different to the table.

867
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,240
 And when they bring those gifts

868
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,140
 and they bring what their sound makes,

869
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,780
 they make beautiful songs.

870
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,860
 And together, they're gonna show us

871
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,700
 what that even looks like.

872
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,220
 So they come together, they're playing, what is this?

873
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,180
 Build My Life?

874
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,820
 You're going build, oh, we got Build My Life.

875
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,020
 Here we go, Build My Life.

876
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,260
 They come together, you got drums beating over here,

877
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,060
 keys coming in, you got guitars,

878
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,420
 they're each playing their different instruments,

879
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,620
 they're all playing in key together, all in concert.

880
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,260
 And when all of them play together,

881
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,780
 the potential that they have individually

882
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,820
 is overshadowed by the way that they all come together.

883
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,580
 And the one of them, if just Estaban was playing,

884
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,880
 everybody stop at Estaban.

885
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,820
 Stop playing.

886
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,860
 It's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.

887
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,380
 But whenever you bring all of them together,

888
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,460
 it makes beautiful noise, beautiful songs.

889
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,500
 Y'all can play again.

890
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
 But when all of them use their gifts and they say,

891
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,820
 hey, I wasn't made to be a guitar,

892
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,660
 I was made to be a drummer,

893
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,360
 and I wasn't made to play the keys,

894
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,620
 I was made to be a guitarist.

895
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,980
 When they use their gifts and say,

896
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,300
 hey, I'm gonna be a part of this,

897
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,160
 they reach a greater potential together.

898
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,740
 What else happens is when all of a sudden,

899
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,220
 you know, a couple of them stop playing,

900
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,940
 just you three stop playing and y'all three keep playing.

901
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:12,500
 Without collectively all working together

902
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,100
 and all playing the song,

903
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,660
 the potential that could have been is diminished.

904
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,300
 And when you take your life and you say,

905
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,020
 man, I'm just gonna go and I'm gonna work on,

906
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,100
 you know, building my Etsy page

907
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,180
 and my corporate America job and working for the weekend,

908
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,060
 you diminish the potential of what God wants to do

909
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,100
 in your life and wants to do through the church

910
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,340
 in your lifetime.

911
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,060
 And the chance to be a part of that is only connected

912
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,780
 or is directly connected to you getting in the game

913
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,880
 and playing with them.

914
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,220
 But when all of them begin to play together

915
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,720
 and they play in the right key

916
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
 and they play the right chord,

917
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,220
 it brings and all of a sudden something

918
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,820
 that was just so ordinary, isolated,

919
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,800
 is beautiful, purposeful,

920
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,220
 and impactful.

921
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,420
 And I hope you hear tonight,

922
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,740
 God wants to use your life

923
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:09,740
 and you have eternal impact opportunities

924
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,660
 around you all the time.

925
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,380
 And this short amount of life that you have

926
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,280
 and it feels long and when you're 25, you feel invincible.

927
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,560
 And the truth of the scripture says,

928
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,100
 man, life, it's like a vapor.

929
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,020
 It's like when you're cold and you breathe out

930
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,940
 in the air outside and there's the air there

931
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,780
 and then it's gone.

932
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,580
 That's what the Bible says, your life is,

933
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,960
 how are you using it?

934
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,340
 Are you using the gifts that God has given you?

935
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,980
 Fighting for relationship and community with other people

936
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,400
 and building community that's leading to maturity.

937
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,760
 'Cause if that's what you're doing, keep going.

938
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,100
 And you are walking worthy of the calling

939
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,460
 that God has laid on your life.

940
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,300
 Let me pray.

941
00:38:53,300 --> 00:39:00,140
 Father, I pray that you would move us to be on mission.

942
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:07,180
 You'd move us to live more surrendered to you.

943
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,060
 You'd use our life to make eternal impacts.

944
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,820
 Would you help us to fight for unity and for oneness

945
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,460
 and against hurts and offenses

946
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,300
 and just all the different things that happen

947
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,840
 to all of us all the time.

948
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,980
 And would your spirit just move us to serve you

949
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,820
 by serving others and building your church

950
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,200
 and being connected to your people and experiencing growth.

951
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,660
 We worship you now in song, amen.

952
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:49,660
