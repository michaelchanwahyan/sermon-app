 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:28,640
 Porsche, how we doing?

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,280
 We doing good?

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,080
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,200
 Come on, come on, come on.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,640
 Hey, it's Thanksgiving week.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,280
 I don't know if you're out of work yet,

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,480
 but work is going to be coming to an end, which

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,480
 is nice for those of you that are gainfully employed.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,520
 Hey, listen, my name's Kylin.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,840
 I was here a little while ago.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,360
 TA did a little bit of an intro for me.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
 But listen, I love Dallas, Texas, so much so

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,920
 that I married someone from here.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,000
 I had to have a piece of this city with me every day

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,980
 of my life for the rest of my life.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,280
 She's sitting right over here.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,440
 Everybody say, hi, Brooke.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,360
 Hi, Brooke.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,640
 She really is the best thing in my life.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,400
 Get to know her whenever you get a chance.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
 Hey, I'm excited for tonight.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,520
 It's crazy.

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,440
 I wasn't planning to say this, but just the way

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,400
 the evening has crafted together is so very clearly

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,640
 from the Lord.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,140
 You'll have to take my word for it,

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,760
 because there's a lot that's gone into preparing this talk

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,720
 and visiting with this team and getting ready for this night

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,800
 that God just affirmed for me individually.

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,440
 And what I saw over the course of our worship set

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,400
 was this team lead in places that I hadn't previously

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,000
 informed them we would be going.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,120
 And so here's what I want you to know from the very beginning

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,620
 of the night.

36
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,520
 I want you to know this.

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,760
 The Lord is here tonight.

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,440
 And so I don't know if you intended

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,160
 to be here this evening or if someone kind of drug you

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,400
 into it unknowingly or if you're here looking

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,440
 for that certain someone.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,960
 I don't know what you may be here for.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
 But I know that God has brought you here

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,800
 for a very specific reason.

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,880
 And it's that he wants to meet with you,

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,060
 that the presence of the living God

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,120
 is here at the porch tonight.

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,760
 So with that said, I want to lead off with a question.

49
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,520
 And I want you to ponder this to yourself.

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,040
 And then I'll share a story and show you where we're going.

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,720
 Is your experience of God as wonderful

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 as you've heard him to be?

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,000
 That's rhetorical.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,400
 Is your experience of God as wonderful

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,240
 as you've heard him to be?

56
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,280
 A couple of years ago, my wife Brooke and I,

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,560
 we made a trip to Italy.

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
 And while we were in Italy, we went to Rome.

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,360
 And there's a bunch of different things you can do in Rome,

60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,280
 so many different things that you can fill up

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,160
 your itinerary with.

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,440
 But there was one non-negotiable we had to do,

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,880
 one thing that I asserted myself and made sure

64
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,120
 we checked out, which was the Roman Colosseum.

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,960
 Anybody seen the Roman Colosseum in here before?

66
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
 Show of hands.

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,140
 Yes, I don't know if you know this,

68
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,320
 but the Roman Colosseum, it was recently listed

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,040
 on the New Seven Wonders of the World.

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,720
 It was voted on by millions of people all across the globe,

71
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,940
 and it came in second place.

72
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,640
 And so I knew, man, we're going to be there,

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
 and I've got to see this thing for myself.

74
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,280
 I have heard the stories, I have read the books,

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,960
 I've seen Russell Crowe fight his way out of it

76
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,440
 and into his freedom through the movie "Gladiator."

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,160
 We've got to go check it out.

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,080
 But I didn't just want to visit the Colosseum.

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,480
 I wanted to experience the Colosseum.

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,480
 I wanted to maximize my enjoyment of it.

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,440
 And so I knew I'm not just going to pick up a ticket

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,040
 and kind of meander my way through its hallways.

83
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,240
 No, what I want is I want a certified tour guide,

84
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,200
 someone that is so obsessed with this place

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,760
 that they have committed their life to learning about it.

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,480
 And so we did that.

87
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,440
 We found a young man from Italy named Vincenzo.

88
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,640
 He was not from Rome, but he had moved to Rome

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,920
 so that way he could specialize in its archeology.

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,520
 He wanted to give his life to this place,

91
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,120
 which is exactly what I was looking for.

92
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,480
 So the day comes and I am jazzed up.

93
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,320
 I am ready.

94
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,020
 And so we show up and nothing goes the way

95
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,160
 that we expected it to.

96
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,320
 Like it was supposed to be beautiful outside.

97
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,120
 It was forecasted to be a great day.

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,820
 And then we swing open the cab door and it is pouring rain.

99
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,880
 We make our way over to our tour group.

100
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,440
 And I thought we were going to be amongst a small group

101
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,740
 of specifically invested learners,

102
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,020
 but we were like a herd of cattle, shoulder to shoulder,

103
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,480
 clamoring amongst this giant amphitheater.

104
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
 And not only were we just listed

105
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
 amongst a bunch of different people,

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,960
 but we were put in such a large group

107
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,280
 that I couldn't ask the questions that I prepared.

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,840
 Like I came wanting to learn about this place.

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,200
 So I couldn't get the sort of insight from Vincenzo

110
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,760
 that I was paying good money for him to share with me.

111
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,000
 And then lastly, Vincenzo,

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,240
 this historian that was supposed to blow my mind,

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
 just spent a couple of hours talking

114
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,320
 about the various different kinds of marble

115
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,660
 that you'll find throughout the Colosseum.

116
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,720
 You see, I had such great expectations

117
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,120
 of what would happen at the Colosseum,

118
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,980
 but my experience was underwhelming.

119
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,920
 It's this wonder of the world,

120
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,060
 but it just left me wondering

121
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,960
 where the nearest gelato shop was.

122
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,100
 I share this with you for this reason.

123
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,720
 Did my individual experience of the Colosseum

124
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,080
 invalidate that the Colosseum doesn't deserve

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,920
 to be listed amongst the new seven wonders of the world?

126
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,960
 No, of course not.

127
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,660
 No, it is amazing.

128
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,880
 But despite the fact that I showed up

129
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
 and I gave my best effort

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,600
 towards enjoying it for all that it was,

131
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,840
 I found it to be underwhelming.

132
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,320
 It wasn't wonderful to me, but that didn't mean

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,440
 it wasn't in fact as wonderful as the world,

134
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,880
 literally the globe had deemed it to be identified as.

135
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,400
 In the same way, so many of us,

136
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,480
 we have failed to experience the one true wonder

137
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
 of the world, which is God,

138
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,120
 in a way that lives up to our expectations.

139
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,320
 We even do everything we know we're supposed to.

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,640
 We show up to church and we read our Bible

141
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,800
 and we lift our hands during worship

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,040
 and we show up to community group

143
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,440
 and we engage in Bible study and we confess our sins

144
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,000
 and we do our best.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,040
 Like we show up and we give our utmost.

146
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,240
 And yet we find that no matter how hard we try,

147
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,320
 it just still feels underwhelming.

148
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,580
 Why is it so hard?

149
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,840
 I have sat with so many young adults, just like you,

150
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,040
 that are wondering, "Kylin, I've done everything.

151
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,920
 I've tried to run all the right plays,

152
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,920
 and yet it's just underwhelming for me.

153
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,160
 God's not as wonderful as everybody claims him to be."

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,760
 So what's your experience of him?

155
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,280
 Is your experience of God as wonderful

156
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,200
 as you've heard him to be?

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
 If your answer to that question is, "Honestly, no,"

158
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,680
 then tonight's for you.

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,280
 I want to answer why God is truly wonderful

160
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,520
 and how you can experience him for who he is.

161
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,680
 And the way that we'll do that,

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,800
 as we get into a passage that the Apostle Paul speaks from,

163
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,040
 is we're gonna see it's through

164
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,440
 what I would claim to be the most essential,

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,900
 like the most fundamental aspect of the Christian life,

166
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,340
 which is prayer.

167
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,800
 Prayer, you know, that thing that you,

168
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,840
 like you cursorily say that you're gonna do for people

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
 when you're not really sure how to help them out.

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,920
 Man, that sounds super hard.

171
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,120
 I'll be praying for you.

172
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,860
 But then you may not in fact actually do so.

173
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,760
 Or it's the thing that you do

174
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,960
 whenever you show up with a group of friends

175
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
 and you sit around a dinner table and,

176
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
 "Hold on guys, before we eat,

177
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,000
 we need to do the right thing.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,480
 We need to pray to God and bless the food,

179
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,980
 even though we don't know what in fact we're doing.

180
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,800
 How am I blessing this food?

181
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,360
 I don't know how to impart such powers

182
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,840
 to the bread on the table, right?"

183
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
 Or it's the thing, it's the last ditch Hail Mary pass.

184
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,800
 We heave whenever we've walked out of that interview

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,560
 and we're not sure how they feel about us,

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,400
 or we sent that text message and we see the dots

187
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,720
 and we're not sure what are they gonna say,

188
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,960
 if they're gonna say anything,

189
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,920
 or it's the thing we feel whenever we know,

190
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,040
 like, "Man, Thanksgiving's coming up

191
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,080
 and I've got to see those people in my family."

192
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,960
 We pray, right?

193
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,000
 You see, prayer is a frequented

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,960
 and familiar part of the human experience.

195
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,520
 Data from Pew Research Center shows

196
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,320
 that almost half of US adults,

197
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,160
 half of US adults, as broadly as we can describe it,

198
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,160
 half, almost half of US adults say they pray daily,

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,520
 despite the fact that we live in a post-Christian America.

200
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,240
 Gallup Research reveals that more Americans

201
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,560
 will pray in a given week than will exercise,

202
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,060
 drive a car, have sex, or go to work.

203
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,760
 Everybody prays.

204
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 Everybody, across religions, across the globe,

205
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,400
 no matter your socioeconomic status,

206
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,880
 every single person prays.

207
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 It doesn't matter where you come from.

208
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
 It doesn't matter really what you believe.

209
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,440
 Across religions, even the most staunch atheist

210
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,060
 has lifted a half-hearted prayer

211
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,080
 in a moment of deep need and hurt.

212
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,200
 You see, under the hood of humanity

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,040
 is this instinctive inclination to pray

214
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,080
 whenever times get tough.

215
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,860
 This is true for everyone.

216
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,400
 So here is the question for you tonight.

217
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,580
 Why don't we enjoy it?

218
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,340
 Like, if it's built into me, why don't I enjoy this?

219
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,640
 Why isn't it more life-giving?

220
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,560
 Well, I think a lot can be said about this,

221
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
 but we've only got a little bit of time together,

222
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,840
 so I'm gonna boil it down to one idea,

223
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,720
 and then we're gonna work through that idea together.

224
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
 But I would say this is why we don't enjoy it.

225
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 We do not enjoy prayer because we don't think it works.

226
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,280
 We're not convinced it works.

227
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,580
 We're convinced it's boring and it's obligatory

228
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,880
 and it's customary and it's even confusing,

229
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,160
 but we're not sure it's actually effective.

230
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,180
 It stands in contrast to other varying aspects

231
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,940
 of the Christian experience that are immediately gratifying.

232
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,160
 Like, if you sit down in the morning and you read your Bible,

233
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,440
 you may not enjoy the experience, I pray you do,

234
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,080
 but you may in fact learn something.

235
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,600
 Like, there's an opportunity for you to walk away

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,780
 and be like, man, that's an idea that I didn't have.

237
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,360
 There's an opportunity for gratification in that moment.

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
 When you fast, you walk away hungry.

239
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,400
 Your body lets you know, this is working.

240
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,680
 Whenever you show up to church

241
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,620
 and you confess your sins to one another,

242
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,960
 there's a sense of relief that happens

243
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,520
 as you divulge the worst parts of yourself

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,200
 and you find amongst the body of Christ

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,920
 people that look at you and say,

246
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,240
 we love you and we're still for you.

247
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,520
 Yet prayer is different than all of these

248
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,260
 because prayer is not immediately gratifying.

249
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,880
 It doesn't offer you immediate results.

250
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,880
 You lift up prayers and you hope to God he hears,

251
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,000
 and I guess I'll wait and see.

252
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
 This is our experience with prayer,

253
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,460
 which is why so many of us have lost the desire for it.

254
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,640
 Which brings me to my second question.

255
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,280
 Why should we even desire it if this is the case?

256
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,280
 Why is this something worth pursuing?

257
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,520
 Because I think it's through prayer

258
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,600
 that you actually experience God

259
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,740
 to be as wonderful as you've heard him to be.

260
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,800
 That's what the Apostle Paul is gonna tell us

261
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,280
 in the book of Philippians.

262
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
 If you have a Bible,

263
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,940
 you can turn with me to Philippians chapter four.

264
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,520
 If you don't, don't worry about it.

265
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,800
 Scripture is gonna be on the screen.

266
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
 We'll read through it together.

267
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,220
 But here's what I need to say

268
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,240
 as you're turning to this passage.

269
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,160
 This is going to be, if you've grown up in the church,

270
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,880
 a very familiar text.

271
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,920
 It's gonna be one that you've turned to

272
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,960
 in moments of great anxiety,

273
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,160
 in times when stress has felt heavy.

274
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,920
 And while this passage says so much

275
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,720
 for the sake of your anxiety relief,

276
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,400
 I think this passage is actually speaking so much more

277
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,440
 that I'm looking forward to us getting into.

278
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,420
 So here's what it says.

279
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,320
 It says this in Philippians chapter four,

280
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,880
 and we're gonna pick it up in 5B,

281
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,800
 which is going to be the second half of verse five.

282
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
 So when it pops up, you'll see it highlighted there,

283
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,760
 but this is what it says.

284
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,560
 The Lord is at hand.

285
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,920
 Do not be anxious about anything,

286
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,600
 but in everything, by prayer and supplication,

287
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,880
 with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

288
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,840
 So let me just ask, how does that verse leave you feeling?

289
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,680
 Does that feel sensible?

290
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,320
 Does it feel frustrating?

291
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
 I know for myself, as a young man,

292
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,280
 when I would read this verse in specific,

293
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,160
 it felt frustratingly ridiculous.

294
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,640
 Thanks, Paul.

295
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,560
 Man, I'm dealing with a lot right now,

296
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,880
 and I was hoping to maybe get some practical insights

297
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,320
 and steps I could take in order to get out of this situation,

298
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
 but you're right.

299
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,800
 I'll just pray about it, and we'll see how that goes.

300
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,280
 If that is your reaction to this verse,

301
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,280
 then just know that's not an uncommon response

302
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,800
 to this verse, and yet there's an explanation

303
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,080
 for why you may in fact be misreading this.

304
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,000
 You see, so often when we come to this passage,

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,760
 we start in verse six, which is a command from Paul.

306
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
 Do not be anxious.

307
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,320
 Hey, I know things are hard.

308
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,640
 Suck it up.

309
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,720
 You're gonna be okay.

310
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,600
 Just pray about it.

311
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,560
 Just talk to the Lord.

312
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,680
 You're gonna make it out all right.

313
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,120
 Like that's the way we read it,

314
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,840
 and yet here's what you need to know.

315
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,000
 Verse six is an imperative statement.

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
 It is a command, but it's preceded

317
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,760
 by an indicative statement, a statement of fact.

318
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,200
 Paul wants you to know, hey, there is something

319
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,140
 that is true, and as a result of that truth,

320
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,280
 you then do these things.

321
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,600
 So what is he saying?

322
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,560
 He's saying, hey, the Lord is at hand.

323
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,400
 Some versions say the Lord is near.

324
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,220
 So don't be anxious.

325
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,360
 God's here.

326
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,440
 Don't worry about it.

327
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,620
 He's close by.

328
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
 Talk to him about it.

329
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,600
 Go visit with him.

330
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
 Like this is an amazing truth for us to know

331
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,680
 that prayer is the passage to God's presence.

332
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,520
 Like that's what Paul's trying to communicate to you.

333
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,480
 If you wanna come into the presence of God,

334
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,440
 this is the way you do it.

335
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
 You talk to him.

336
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,100
 You pray to him.

337
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,640
 That's how you get close.

338
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,080
 Like God, he is always available.

339
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,520
 His door is open.

340
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,160
 He's got time on the calendar.

341
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,560
 You're never bothering him.

342
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,240
 He's not too busy for you.

343
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,200
 Like when you come to him and you pray,

344
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,880
 you literally are crossing heaven's threshold,

345
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,800
 and you get to engage with the living God.

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,560
 You get to meet in his presence.

347
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,320
 Prayer is the passage to that place.

348
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,160
 That's why Paul is echoing the words of David

349
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
 from Psalm 145.

350
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,520
 Psalm 145, 18 says, "The Lord is near to all."

351
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,000
 To who?

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,880
 To everybody.

353
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,760
 Like non-discriminatorily.

354
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,080
 Like God is available to everyone who calls on him.

355
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,480
 To anyone that prays to him.

356
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,560
 To all who call on him in truth.

357
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
 God is near to you.

358
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,800
 When we call out to God,

359
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,440
 God comes near to us.

360
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,080
 And when God comes near,

361
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,000
 everything comes into perspective.

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,640
 It's like if you were to stand

363
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,280
 at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

364
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,360
 or you stand at the height of a skyscraper,

365
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,840
 or you're adrift in the open ocean,

366
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,400
 and you pray to God that never happens to you,

367
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,000
 everything comes into perspective in that moment, right?

368
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,080
 You realize how small you are.

369
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
 When God is near,

370
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,280
 you realize how dominating,

371
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,640
 and everlasting, and transcendent he is.

372
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,640
 And you also realize how infinitely small

373
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,200
 and urgently expiring you are.

374
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,800
 This is what happens when we come close to the Lord,

375
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,880
 when we get near to his presence.

376
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,680
 The nearer we come to him,

377
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,760
 the clearer he becomes to us.

378
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,400
 So then why do we feel so far from him at times?

379
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
 Like I'm not too naive to believe,

380
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,320
 like some of you have walked in here tonight,

381
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,640
 and you're like, man, God feels a million miles away.

382
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,700
 He couldn't feel further off.

383
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,720
 You're talking about him being near?

384
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,200
 That is not at all the case for my reality.

385
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,800
 What are you even talking about?

386
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,520
 I've been there.

387
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,800
 Let me tell you what I wish I could tell myself

388
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,120
 in past moments like that.

389
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,080
 God hasn't moved.

390
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:22,060
 God has only and always moved in one direction,

391
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,400
 and it's towards us.

392
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,120
 God wants to be near to us.

393
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,740
 That's what the Bible is trying to tell us.

394
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,200
 That's what the culmination of the person of Jesus

395
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,540
 is making clear.

396
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,480
 God wanted to be so close to us

397
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,060
 that he would send his only son to remove any obstacle,

398
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,080
 to remove any imposition.

399
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,980
 God would do anything to get close to you.

400
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,500
 So why does he feel so far off?

401
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,320
 Because we have impeded our prayers

402
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,620
 and obstructed our passage to his presence.

403
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,240
 We've blockaded our nearness to him

404
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,920
 because we've become preoccupied with things

405
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,980
 that are not of him.

406
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,960
 Because we become anxious.

407
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,560
 Like that's where Paul goes next.

408
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,600
 Like as he keeps going, he says,

409
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,640
 "Hey, the Lord is at hand, so do not be anxious.

410
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,420
 "Don't become so absorbed by that future possibility

411
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:25,560
 "that you forget or you neglect God's present proximity,

412
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,240
 "that he's here, he's nearby."

413
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 In the Greek, the word that Paul uses here for anxious

414
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,040
 is a really interesting word.

415
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,680
 It's a word that means to divide or to tear apart.

416
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,080
 It's literally the idea of two opposing forces

417
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,240
 pulling something apart.

418
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,040
 Something that was whole is now being divided into two,

419
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,200
 which is a really good word picture

420
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,280
 because that's kind of what anxiety does to us, right?

421
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,640
 It leaves us torn up.

422
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,400
 It's like, oh my gosh, I'm like split in half.

423
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,720
 I don't feel whole at all.

424
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,400
 I feel like I've given part of myself to this thing

425
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,560
 and part of myself to this thing

426
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,160
 and maybe another part of myself to that thing.

427
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,520
 Like this is what anxiety does to us.

428
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,760
 A.J. Cronin, he says,

429
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 "Our anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow.

430
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,920
 "It only empties today of its strength."

431
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,800
 Your anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow.

432
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,680
 It only empties today of its strength.

433
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,120
 When you're anxious,

434
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,360
 it does nothing to help you in the future

435
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,120
 and it does everything to hurt you in the present.

436
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
 This is what anxiety does.

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,080
 Anxiety is like our rocking chair.

438
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,080
 Like it takes an initial investment of effort

439
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
 and as you worry, it may feel nice,

440
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,280
 but it is terribly unproductive

441
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,360
 and it takes you nowhere that you're wishing to go.

442
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,400
 This is what anxiety does to us.

443
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,840
 And so what does Paul say?

444
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,560
 Like, what are we supposed to do with that?

445
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,120
 And he goes on.

446
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,240
 "Don't be anxious about anything,

447
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,920
 "but in everything by prayer and supplication,

448
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,400
 "talking to God with thanksgiving,

449
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,800
 "let your requests be made known to him."

450
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,240
 Paul is echoing now the words of Jesus.

451
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,000
 In Matthew 6, 31, 33, it says,

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,760
 "Therefore, do not be anxious saying,

453
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,480
 "what shall we eat or what shall we drink

454
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,600
 "or what shall we wear,

455
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
 "but seek first the kingdom of God.

456
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,560
 "Seek the things of God

457
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,200
 "and everything else will be added unto you."

458
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,840
 Everything you need,

459
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,680
 whatever's claiming for your attention,

460
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,160
 it's taken care of whenever you're one of God's own kids.

461
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,640
 Whenever you trust him and you seek his things,

462
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,360
 what you learn is that I worry about nothing,

463
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,560
 but I pray about everything.

464
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,760
 This is the way that we as the children of God

465
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
 are meant to engage the world,

466
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,080
 engage our adversity, engage our anxiety.

467
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,920
 Like what we're supposed to do

468
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,040
 is we're supposed to worry about none of it,

469
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,920
 but pray about all of it,

470
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,000
 because we have a God, a father in heaven

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
 that looks after us, that takes care of us,

472
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
 that knows what we need and meets our needs

473
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,000
 in ways that we know not to meet for ourselves.

474
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,060
 So this is all really good in theory,

475
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,520
 but the truth of the matter is we're pretty bad at this.

476
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,560
 I'm pretty bad at it.

477
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,960
 I'll throw myself into the lot.

478
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,600
 Like we know that we should go to God,

479
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,560
 give things to him and trust the fact

480
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,920
 that he's gonna take care of us.

481
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,160
 And yet instead what we do,

482
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,840
 instead of giving ourselves to him,

483
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,400
 we often give ourselves to other things.

484
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,720
 We lend ourselves to anxieties over our performance

485
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,480
 or our singleness or our addiction or our reputation

486
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,640
 or something that happened in our past,

487
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,000
 some trauma that we've incurred.

488
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,440
 And what happens whenever we feel anxiety

489
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,880
 about these things, about my performance at work,

490
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,360
 like my desire to do a good job,

491
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,760
 like I could give this to God,

492
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 but instead what so often we do is we just suppress it.

493
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,880
 We push it down.

494
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,440
 We bury it down deep.

495
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,920
 We try not to let anybody know

496
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,880
 that things are not actually okay.

497
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,720
 Hey, how's work going?

498
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,520
 Work is great.

499
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,640
 It is so good.

500
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,920
 I love my cubicle, my team.

501
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,640
 They're critical sometimes, but you know what?

502
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,960
 Like I think that they're just trying

503
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,320
 to help me be the best version of me I can be.

504
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,760
 And so we just push it aside.

505
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,320
 We suppress it as much as possible

506
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,640
 in the hopes that in doing so, it will go away.

507
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,920
 When you do that, when you suppress your anxiety,

508
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,880
 it doesn't go away.

509
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,480
 It just changes shape.

510
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,600
 Now it becomes something different to manage.

511
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,640
 Or maybe it's not suppression.

512
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,600
 Maybe that's not how you deal with your anxiety.

513
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
 Maybe instead it's something like obsession.

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,360
 With my dating life, with my singleness,

515
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,800
 with the fact that I don't wanna be alone forever,

516
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,040
 with the fact that my relationship

517
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,280
 isn't in fact where I want it to be.

518
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,120
 And so you know what I'll do?

519
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,720
 Like I'm gonna help it along.

520
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,800
 Like I'm anxious about this.

521
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,760
 And so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take,

522
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,800
 I'm gonna take some of myself

523
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,920
 and I'm actually now going to focus on my appearance.

524
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,080
 I'm gonna give myself over to the gym

525
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,480
 or to that Pilates class or to CrossFit

526
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,320
 or whatever it may be

527
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,680
 that's gonna make me more desirable physically.

528
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
 But I'm not just gonna do that.

529
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,040
 I'm also going to give another piece of myself

530
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,480
 a way to being socially acceptable.

531
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,040
 So now I'm gonna reject some of these friends

532
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,000
 and engage with more of these friends

533
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,480
 because this is what it looks like

534
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,920
 for me to be more desirable to my boyfriend, my girlfriend,

535
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,720
 or that guy or girl that I like

536
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
 that hasn't yet asked me out

537
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
 and yet I'm going to continue to do it.

538
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
 And then maybe it's not just that.

539
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,240
 Maybe I'm gonna change my behavior.

540
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,400
 I'm gonna make now some compromises in life.

541
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,040
 I'm gonna bend my physical boundaries.

542
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,320
 I'm gonna be willing to go places

543
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,160
 I know I shouldn't do things

544
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,880
 I know I shouldn't spend time,

545
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,200
 more time than necessary

546
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,360
 in things that I wish I could take back.

547
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
 Like we give ourselves away

548
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 and what happens is we don't,

549
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,480
 we don't get rid of our anxiety.

550
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,880
 What we do is we just multiply it.

551
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,920
 Now instead of one thing,

552
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,680
 you have multiple things you have to worry about.

553
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,840
 Just as anxiety is described in the Greek,

554
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,840
 it's torn you, not just in two, not just in three,

555
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,800
 but maybe into four or five, six, multiple pieces.

556
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,360
 This is what we do.

557
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,040
 We suppress, we obsess over our anxiety

558
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,880
 in the hopes that this is how I'm gonna fix it.

559
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
 This is how it's gonna get resolved.

560
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,600
 You know what Paul's telling us to do?

561
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,720
 Do not suppress, do not obsess, just confess it.

562
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,360
 Just confess it.

563
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,600
 Just come to God.

564
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,880
 Like just come talk to him.

565
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,560
 His door's open, he's available, he's close by,

566
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,520
 just pray to him.

567
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,000
 Just engage with the God of the universe.

568
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,480
 Like I love that he says here,

569
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 "Let your requests be made known."

570
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,760
 Like that verb is a passive verb,

571
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,200
 which just means it's not something you're actively doing.

572
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,920
 You're not actively requesting of God,

573
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,600
 you're instinctively requesting of God,

574
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,360
 which is what we all do whenever times get hard.

575
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
 We wanna talk to people about it.

576
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,360
 Work is tough, I wanna engage with someone about that idea.

577
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,320
 I wanna process it, I need a sounding board.

578
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
 I need someone to help me process through my venting, right?

579
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
 Or in a relationship, like I need my girls

580
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
 and my guys to help me out, to process through these things.

581
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,640
 We want to talk about them.

582
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,920
 That is instinctual.

583
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,960
 You're meant to let it out.

584
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,280
 But here's what Paul's saying.

585
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 You don't just let it out, you lift it up.

586
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,920
 You lift it up to God.

587
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,000
 You do, you absolutely go and talk to someone about it.

588
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,800
 You talk to him, that's who you talk to.

589
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,240
 He wants to hear from you

590
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,760
 because he is the only one who can truly help you.

591
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,440
 Charles Spurgeon says, "The best style of prayer

592
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,040
 is that which cannot be called anything else but a cry."

593
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,800
 The best style of prayer,

594
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
 it can't be called anything but a cry.

595
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,960
 It is instinctual to pray.

596
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,840
 Like we said at the beginning,

597
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,800
 it's hardwired into our human nature.

598
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,280
 And what's fascinating is I was thinking

599
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,920
 about this idea, if you think about prayer,

600
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,000
 the concept of it may have been taught to you

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
 by someone else, maybe someone like me,

602
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,080
 teaching you about this concept of prayer.

603
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,520
 But the practice of prayer was likely not taught

604
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,040
 to you by anybody.

605
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,120
 Like more than likely, times got tough, things got hard.

606
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,960
 And what you did is you just reflexively started talking

607
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,800
 to God about it.

608
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,680
 You kicked God, help, please.

609
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,360
 Like what's happening in my work?

610
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,040
 What's happening with my family?

611
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,560
 God, I didn't even say that,

612
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,240
 but look at what's happening to my reputation.

613
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,600
 Lord, please, would you help me in this area?

614
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,120
 It's hardwired into you.

615
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,320
 God has put it into you

616
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,240
 because he wants you to engage with him.

617
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,600
 Do you see the love of God in that?

618
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,000
 That he said, "Hey, I designed you for me.

619
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,960
 I didn't design you for all these other things.

620
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,560
 You're not supposed to get sidetracked

621
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,240
 and swept off your feet with a myriad of other anxieties,

622
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,200
 concerns, or worries in life.

623
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,760
 No, you're supposed to be fixed upon me."

624
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,720
 All these things that are demanding your attention.

625
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,640
 I'm the only one deserving it.

626
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,280
 I'm the only one that deserves your attention.

627
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,320
 I'm the only one that can help you in it.

628
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,720
 And I want to, that's the heart of God.

629
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,440
 Like I know for myself, just to get really practical,

630
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
 like Kylan, how do you even do this?

631
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,320
 When I wake up in the morning,

632
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,280
 I sit down and the first thing I do

633
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,680
 is I take an inventory of how I feel.

634
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,220
 Where are my emotions at?

635
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,560
 That's what I wanna know.

636
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,160
 Like, did I get up off the wrong side of the bed?

637
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,480
 Am I nervous about what's coming today?

638
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,680
 Am I in a fight?

639
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,320
 Is there conflict in my home between my wife and I?

640
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,560
 Like, how do I feel right now?

641
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,000
 And what I do as I assess my emotions

642
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,880
 is I reverse engineer back from them.

643
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,000
 And I try to figure out why I feel that way.

644
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,740
 And so often what I find is they're rooted in anxiety.

645
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,760
 I'm nervous, I'm anxious, I'm stressed about something

646
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,720
 that is coming for me later in the day.

647
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,260
 And so what I do in those moments is two things.

648
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,520
 I admit them to God and I submit them to God.

649
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
 I admit them and I submit them.

650
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,840
 God, I admit this is where I'm at, Lord.

651
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,960
 I wish this weren't the case, but God, this is the truth.

652
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,680
 And then God, I submit it to you.

653
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,020
 I wish I didn't, God.

654
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,380
 And yet, Lord, I know, even at my worst, Christ died for me.

655
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,780
 And so I'm loved and accepted

656
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,480
 and you're capable of changing me.

657
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,680
 This is the way that I approach it.

658
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,000
 What I don't do is I don't spiritualize my complaining.

659
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,160
 Like, I don't come to the Lord and say,

660
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,720
 "God, I wish you would help me at work

661
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,460
 "because my boss hates me and my coworkers are so critical.

662
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,440
 "And God, I never thought I'd still be stuck in this job

663
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,880
 "and I'm never gonna amount to anything.

664
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
 "Oh my gosh, I'm never gonna make a difference."

665
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,800
 Like, I don't just start complaining to God.

666
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,640
 That's not what I do.

667
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,480
 That's indulging my anxiety.

668
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,880
 That's permitting it.

669
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,920
 And we don't permit it.

670
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,520
 We admit it, we submit it, and then we move on.

671
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,880
 And we trust it with him.

672
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,340
 We come to the Lord and we say,

673
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,520
 "God, here's what has my heart."

674
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,240
 We spread it on the table.

675
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,000
 We trust him with it.

676
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,160
 And then we go forward and believe

677
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,360
 that he will work it for our good

678
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,520
 because that's what he's done all along.

679
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,400
 And as we do these things,

680
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
 what we find is what happens in verse seven,

681
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,160
 "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

682
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,120
 "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

683
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,520
 It's interesting.

684
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,000
 This expression, peace of God,

685
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,400
 only appears one time in the entire New Testament,

686
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,920
 which is right here, which feels weird, right?

687
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,600
 Peace in God.

688
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
 They kind of go together.

689
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,480
 Wouldn't you expect that to see,

690
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,120
 you would expect to see that somewhere else.

691
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,480
 It's a match made in heaven.

692
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,760
 And yet what you need to know

693
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,500
 is that Paul is saying something very specific

694
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,600
 about God's peace in this moment.

695
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,560
 You see, what Paul is saying about God's peace

696
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,040
 is he's saying this isn't a transactional peace.

697
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,680
 Like this isn't just a quid pro quo relationship

698
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,480
 where God, I give you my anxiety

699
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,040
 and you give me your peace.

700
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,440
 That's not how this works.

701
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,480
 It's not a transactional peace.

702
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,920
 And it's not even a constitutional peace

703
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,360
 that I have peace with God

704
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,080
 through my justification in Jesus Christ,

705
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
 though that's true.

706
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,640
 But that's not what he's talking about right here.

707
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,760
 What he's talking about

708
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,680
 is he's talking about an existential peace,

709
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,360
 an existential peace.

710
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 So what does that mean?

711
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,040
 I'll illustrate it to you like this.

712
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,200
 When my wife and I went on a honeymoon,

713
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,060
 we went to an all-inclusive resort.

714
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,240
 This is an aside, not a part of the lesson,

715
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,960
 but I recommend an all-inclusive, man.

716
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,880
 Like you just spent the last several months

717
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,160
 planning the biggest party of your life.

718
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,580
 It's nice to go make some indulgent decisions

719
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,880
 with no cost to you whatsoever,

720
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,280
 an impulsive decision, right?

721
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,200
 Not indulgent, impulsive.

722
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,640
 Go make an impulsive decision.

723
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,860
 Go to an all-inclusive resort.

724
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,240
 And yet what we did when we were there

725
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,800
 is we spent money on one thing.

726
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,920
 And the one thing we spent money on

727
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,160
 is we went to the resort spa.

728
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,320
 I had never been to a spa before.

729
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,400
 And I don't know that I've been since.

730
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,440
 But that experience was unlike anything

731
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,240
 I had ever had before.

732
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,860
 It was otherworldly.

733
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,860
 Like we walked into the spa and everything changed.

734
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:48,320
 Like the music in the air wasn't like

735
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
 whatever party music was playing outside.

736
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,800
 Instead it was this, it was the sound of raindrops

737
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,120
 and birds chirping, which doesn't sound that enticing.

738
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,040
 And yet it was incredible.

739
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,720
 And like the look of the room,

740
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,600
 the room was like just enveloped in this soft white glow.

741
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,920
 And the smell in the air was fresh.

742
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,440
 It's like citrus, mint.

743
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,560
 And then the lady at the front desk,

744
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,040
 she even spoke in an otherworldly way.

745
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,240
 "Hello, welcome to the spa.

746
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
 It is our joy to serve you today.

747
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,280
 Would you like one of our complimentary robes?

748
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,120
 Sure."

749
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,440
 Two men appear in a robe that's in warm blankets.

750
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,280
 You know?

751
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,320
 It was like, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced.

752
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,960
 That's what happens when you come to the presence of God.

753
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,880
 That's what this is saying,

754
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,480
 that when you give your anxiety over to him,

755
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,720
 you step into his, you step into his peace.

756
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,640
 Like you come into his presence,

757
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,840
 an environment that befits him.

758
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,840
 God, by his very nature, is not morally errored in any way.

759
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,400
 Like from God comes no disorder,

760
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,440
 no disruption, no deterioration.

761
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,140
 He is peace-giving, perfect, whole,

762
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,240
 which is in fact what this word means.

763
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,040
 Like the word here for peace,

764
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,160
 it doesn't just mean tranquility or calm,

765
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,120
 it means wholeness.

766
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,400
 That when you come to God and you find

767
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,160
 that he is as unified and complete

768
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,960
 and not disordered, but ordered and perfect

769
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,680
 as you have been told,

770
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,680
 he takes all of these broken and separated

771
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,360
 and torn asunder pieces of you,

772
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,360
 and he begins to make them whole together again.

773
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,820
 He unites the parts of yourself.

774
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,380
 That you've given away.

775
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,900
 He takes that obsession you have with your performance,

776
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,760
 that suppression you've applied to your addiction,

777
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,180
 that focus you have on your reputation,

778
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,620
 and he blends them back together.

779
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,820
 And he makes you as he himself is,

780
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,660
 whole, not divided,

781
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:21,180
 but united.

782
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,100
 This is what this verse means.

783
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,100
 The result of prayer is that it doesn't change God.

784
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,980
 Prayer changes you.

785
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,060
 That's why we pray.

786
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,920
 That's why we come to the Lord.

787
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,220
 Like what we find is that God is available

788
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,660
 and capable for us.

789
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,700
 He's available.

790
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,660
 He loves you.

791
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,740
 He's been waiting for you to come,

792
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,980
 and he's capable, he's strong enough for you.

793
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,860
 He can fix whatever it is you need help with.

794
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,940
 This is his heart.

795
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,120
 Does that mean that as you pray,

796
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,300
 you're gonna get everything you want from him?

797
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,060
 That he's gonna answer your prayers the minute you ask?

798
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,620
 Maybe, maybe, maybe not, right?

799
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,780
 Like he may answer that prayer.

800
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,060
 He may not answer that prayer.

801
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,260
 He won't answer all of them.

802
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,340
 But what you can take confidence in

803
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,500
 is in Matthew chapter six,

804
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,220
 Jesus looks at his disciples and he says,

805
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,980
 "Your father in heaven knows what you need

806
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,220
 "before you ask it."

807
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,100
 Why am I even praying then?

808
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,700
 If he already knows,

809
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,900
 like why do I need to talk to him about it?

810
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,140
 For this reason,

811
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:38,300
 prayer isn't about convincing God of your needs.

812
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,100
 Prayer is about convincing you of your need for him.

813
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,380
 That's why you come to him.

814
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,620
 That's why you pray to him.

815
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,140
 Because you and I need to be reminded

816
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,940
 that it's him we need and nothing else.

817
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,580
 This is what we need to know.

818
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,220
 And this is why he has called us to himself

819
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,060
 to meet with him in a place that promises

820
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,280
 to guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus, Lord.

821
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
 So last story.

822
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,180
 Horatio Spafford was a successful lawyer and businessman

823
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,460
 that lived in Chicago in the 1800s.

824
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
 He was part of a family of six.

825
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,500
 He has a father to a wife named Anna

826
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,200
 and they had four beautiful girls.

827
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,140
 150 years ago today,

828
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,020
 on November 21st of 1873,

829
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,180
 he sent his family across the Atlantic to England

830
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,680
 to go on vacation for the holiday.

831
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,700
 But 150 years ago today, November 21st,

832
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,820
 the French vessel which his family,

833
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,940
 his wife and four daughters were aboard,

834
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,980
 it collided into another seafaring vessel.

835
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,340
 And in the middle of the Atlantic, their ship sank.

836
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:02,700
 The only person to survive the collision was his wife.

837
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:09,620
 She wired him and she said these six words,

838
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,260
 she said, "Saved alone, what shall I do?"

839
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,860
 To which, as the record books recall,

840
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,980
 he quickly booked passage to meet her where she was

841
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,860
 and process through their grief and make their way forward.

842
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,180
 As he's set sail to find her,

843
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,800
 to be reunited, some four days from landfall,

844
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,560
 the captain of his ship, aware of the crisis

845
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,900
 that has befallen Horatio's family,

846
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,220
 calls Horatio to his captain's quarters

847
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,340
 because he knows that the place upon which their vessel

848
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,220
 is now traversing is approximately the place

849
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,920
 where his family's vessel sank.

850
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,360
 And he wanted to tell him himself.

851
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,460
 So he tells Horatio the news,

852
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,220
 that this is where it happened.

853
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,220
 This is where your family was taken from you.

854
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,000
 (gentle music)

855
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,580
 What's amazing is what happens next.

856
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,580
 Alerted of the news, Horatio,

857
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,960
 he steps outside the captain's quarters

858
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,980
 and he finds some space there on the boat.

859
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,500
 And in response to tragedy, worry, concern, adversity,

860
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:38,100
 anxiety, he penned these famous words.

861
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,020
 When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,

862
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,780
 when sorrows like sea billows roll,

863
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,340
 whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,

864
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,860
 it is well with my soul.

865
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:02,420
 In the depth of Horatio's horror,

866
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,260
 the hardship of his circumstance, the depths of his grief,

867
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,980
 and in the midst of your own,

868
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,980
 there is a superior, transcendent, yet eminent peace

869
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:24,740
 which you can find from a God that is equally superior,

870
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:29,140
 transcendent, and eminent to you.

871
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:35,700
 Horatio knew there is one place which peace is freely given

872
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,500
 and it's in the God that freely gave his only Son for me.

873
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:48,580
 Friends, I don't know what you walked in here tonight

874
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,300
 dealing with, but I do know this,

875
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,460
 there is peace for you in the person of Jesus.

876
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,460
 There's peace nowhere else in this world.

877
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,580
 You won't find it elsewhere.

878
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:06,540
 You need only come to him to receive it.

879
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,820
 The presence of God, the fullness of his wonder,

880
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,980
 which many of you have been longing to experience,

881
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,180
 it's available to you tonight

882
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,180
 because the presence of God became the person of God

883
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,460
 in the form of his Son.

884
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,580
 You see, when we knew not to pray and seek God's presence,

885
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,380
 the very presence of God,

886
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,860
 the image of his glory, as Hebrews would say,

887
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,260
 sought us out in the person of the Son.

888
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,100
 When we knew not to lift our worries to him,

889
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,100
 Jesus nevertheless brought God's peace down to us.

890
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,700
 And when we knew not of our need for change,

891
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,780
 evil at heart darkened the understanding of our minds.

892
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,860
 God never lost sight of the fact

893
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,540
 that something needed to change in us,

894
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,540
 that we might be reunited to him.

895
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,020
 He gave it all that you might come close to him.

896
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,180
 The question for you tonight, Porch,

897
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,580
 is how much of him do you want?

898
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,100
 How much of him do you want?

899
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
 Let me pray for us.

900
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,680
 (gentle music)

901
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:44,300
 The Lord is near.

902
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,140
 In the quietness of where you sit with your eyes closed,

903
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,660
 can you just take a moment

904
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,260
 and just say, "Lord, I need you."

905
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,840
 (gentle music)

906
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,340
 And can you register with that reality?

907
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,620
 That God, he's not distant, he's not dormant,

908
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,220
 he's not some idea or concept to study.

909
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,500
 He's living, he's breathing, and he's here tonight.

910
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,820
 He's near to you now.

911
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,100
 Come awake to it.

912
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,120
 (gentle music)

913
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,960
 He's willing to be near to us, God.

914
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,320
 When we were unworthy, undeserving God,

915
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,080
 chasing after all manner of evil instead of you,

916
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,640
 you never lost sight of what we needed.

917
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,660
 You swept in God, the hero of heaven,

918
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,420
 racing through the halls of history

919
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,920
 to be reunited to a people that knew not to want you.

920
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,000
 And you came in the most unsuspecting of ways to Jesus,

921
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,840
 coming in a form that we would not look to admire or respect,

922
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,920
 but looking like ourselves,

923
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,200
 a king deserving of worship, become a servant

924
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,480
 to even the worst sinners of men.

925
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,280
 It's been in your heart, God, to be near to us.

926
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,280
 You, God, have pursued us, and you have finished it.

927
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,640
 You've made passage possible again when there was no way.

928
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,520
 You, God, made a way by the death of your only son,

929
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,480
 bearing in him all the consequence of our sin, God,

930
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,680
 that every one of us might be justified before you,

931
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,200
 cleansed of our wrong, washed clean of our iniquity,

932
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,400
 but God, not only did our sin bury him

933
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,660
 and did he absorb the punishment due us,

934
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,440
 but he rose forth from the grave,

935
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,560
 bursting God from death, declaring to the world,

936
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,240
 I am who I say I am.

937
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,880
 I am the son of God.

938
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:13,480
 I am a son from on high come to seek sinners down low

939
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,720
 that those down low might believe in me

940
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,800
 and come back high where I have returned.

941
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:29,440
 Brother, sister, do you want to experience the wonder of God?

942
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,520
 That wonder is found in one man and one alone,

943
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,020
 and it is Jesus's name.

944
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,760
 Come to him tonight.

945
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,880
 Place your faith in him.

946
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,880
 For those of you that have already done it,

947
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,520
 now is a moment for you to do whatever it means

948
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,060
 to engage with he that is near.

949
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,540
 Maybe you need to sing.

950
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:53,120
 Maybe you need to raise your hands and lift your voices

951
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,520
 and declare to God how wonderful he is.

952
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,140
 But maybe you need to pray.

953
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,860
 Maybe you need to sit close by he that has come close by.

954
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,780
 And you just need to know.

955
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:13,840
 He doesn't need anything from you.

956
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,960
 He wants everything for you.

957
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,480
 And everything finds its fulfillment in him.

958
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,040
 We love you, God.

959
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,680
 We sing to you now.

960
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,320
 We're grateful.

961
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,480
 It's in Jesus's name we pray.

962
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,400
 Amen.
