1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,340
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,920
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,380
 - All right, Porch, welcome.

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,620
 How y'all doing, Dallas?

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,700
 How you doing, Fort Worth?

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,460
 It's awesome to be here.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,220
 Thank you for letting me be with you all tonight.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,120
 I am thrilled to kick off a series we're gonna be doing

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,220
 for the next 10 to 11 weeks,

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,180
 depending on how much we cover each week.

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,140
 It's called Summer on the Mount.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,340
 It's gonna come right out of Matthew 5, 6, and 7.

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,520
 It's the very first words that we have God speaking

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,460
 after 400 years of silence.

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,640
 Now, I want you to think for just a moment

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,500
 as we set this entire thing up.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,700
 I want you to think about what God would say to you

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,980
 if he showed up after nobody had given you any training,

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,980
 any correction, any reproof, for 400 years.

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,980
 Let's just say this.

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,840
 How about nobody had ever once rebuked you,

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,220
 or you had never experienced any consequence

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,780
 to anything that you had done from the time

26
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,060
 you were 16 to 20?

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,900
 20 to 24?

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,260
 24 to 28?

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,760
 I mean, you'd heard enough, not for 400 years,

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,720
 but for four years, you just ran riot in your heart.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,140
 You thought there was no God.

32
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,620
 You thought there was no sense of accountability,

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,820
 and God all of a sudden showed up

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,460
 in probably your most rebellious, wretched,

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,880
 self-absorbed, self-indulgent, wicked state.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,640
 I want you to think just for a moment

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,800
 about the moment in your life that you are most ashamed of.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,760
 I want you to think about the time that you go,

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,840
 man, if there is a God, I hope somehow

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,120
 he's sneezing right now and misses this moment.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
 Just pick one of the 30 or so

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,500
 that you might have to refer to.

43
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,460
 We've all got 'em, right?

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,840
 Stuff that when we get all naked and authentic

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,040
 and tell some folks about stuff that we are

46
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
 bringing to the Lord, we're like,

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
 I ain't never telling anybody about this one.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,620
 And I want you to imagine the light's coming on.

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,160
 I want you to imagine the door opening up,

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,440
 and God himself is going, hey there.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,380
 And there you are.

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,000
 What do you think he's gonna say?

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
 I'm gonna answer that for you tonight.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 Because the way you answer that question

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,280
 is gonna determine the way you live your life,

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
 because there is nothing more important in your life

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,560
 than what you think of when you think of God.

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,160
 And the fact is, when most of us think of God,

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,680
 we think about the God that is gonna come

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,760
 with a billy club that's gonna make

61
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,020
 the most abusive cop look like he's got silly string.

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,400
 We think of God as up there with thunderbolts

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 and lightning and full of vengeance and wrath,

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 a beat cop with an attitude.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,800
 And because of that, we're not really looking

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,640
 to cuddle up next to him, and we're hoping

67
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,400
 that maybe it's all a myth,

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,880
 invented by men to control others.

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,280
 I'm gonna ask you a little riddle as we get started,

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,080
 because it's been well said, and I do believe

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,400
 that what you think about when you think about God

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,640
 is quite possibly the most important thing about you.

73
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
 So here's a little riddle.

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
 I want you to listen to it all the way through.

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,320
 If you've heard it before, please don't shout out the answer.

76
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,240
 Many of you have, some of you haven't.

77
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,520
 But I want you to think, and you gotta listen

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,220
 to this thing all the way through.

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,040
 It is said that about 80% or more of those

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,440
 that graduate from levels of higher education

81
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,640
 cannot answer this riddle.

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,360
 I'll tell you in a second who might be able to.

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,560
 But here's the question.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,520
 What is greater?

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
 Than God.

86
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,540
 What is more evil than the devil?

87
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,240
 The rich need it, the poor have it,

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,960
 and if you eat it, you will die.

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,280
 I want you to think about that.

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,040
 What is the answer to that riddle?

91
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,000
 What is greater than God, more evil than the devil,

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,080
 the rich need it, the poor have it,

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,640
 and if you eat it, you will die.

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,920
 Now is anybody here, raise your hand

95
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,960
 if you've never heard that before.

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,860
 Put your hand up good and high.

97
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,960
 All right?

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,480
 Is anybody whose hand just went up,

99
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,680
 go I know the answer right away.

100
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,200
 Raise your hand again if you think you know the answer.

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,760
 Very few of you, okay.

102
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
 But some of you do.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,420
 Now here's the deal.

104
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,840
 They said that over 80% of individuals

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,000
 who have graduated from institutions of higher learning

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
 don't know the answer to that riddle,

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,680
 and yet a large percentage of children

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,460
 will get it immediately.

109
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,520
 And the reason is, is because we think in very complex,

110
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,440
 the more educated we are, we think in very complex systems,

111
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,560
 and we also do not know the answer to the first question,

112
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
 which by the way, because it's a riddle,

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,480
 is the answer to the last question.

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,840
 And so let's just take these one at a time.

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
 What, if you eat it, will you die?

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,140
 We're gonna work our way backwards,

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,700
 and you might go, well there's a lot of things

118
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,880
 that you might eat and you would die.

119
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,960
 So you might have thought immediately

120
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,880
 and focused in on that one, 'cause I encourage you

121
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,560
 to work yourself all the way to the end.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,960
 So you thought about arsenic.

123
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,840
 You thought about McDonald's, all right?

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,560
 (audience laughing)

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,680
 You thought about a lot of rancid food

126
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880
 or maybe things that are poisonous,

127
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,120
 so you really worked that last one.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
 What do you die if you eat?

129
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,840
 Okay, how about this one?

130
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,560
 The rich need it.

131
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,640
 The poor have it.

132
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,880
 Now that one was kind of crazy,

133
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
 because they go together and you go,

134
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,920
 wait, wait a minute, wait, wait, I thought,

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,480
 the rich are the ones that have everything,

136
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,320
 and the poor are the ones that don't,

137
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,520
 and there is the beginning of the answer to the riddle,

138
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
 so watch this.

139
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,320
 The rich have it.

140
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,160
 What do the rich, what do the poor have?

141
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
 What do the poor have?

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,880
 You go, man, the poor ain't got nothing.

143
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
 What do the rich need?

144
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,900
 Well, the rich don't need nothing, man.

145
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,740
 They got it made.

146
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,760
 Hey, what's more evil than the devil?

147
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,840
 Nothing.

148
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,480
 What, if you eat it, will cause you to die?

149
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,240
 If you eat nothing, start the clock.

150
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,580
 Five, seven days, unless you're preparing

151
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,240
 for a photo shoot for Abs of Steel.

152
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,160
 Then you can make it seven.

153
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,840
 Do a few crunches, get your picture taken,

154
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,480
 and lie to everybody about what that stupid

155
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,160
 little ab roller that a Navy SEAL invented

156
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
 will do for you, all right?

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,720
 But listen to the very first question I asked you.

158
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,360
 What is greater than God?

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,840
 Well, if you've got a biblical view,

160
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,720
 if you have listened to the sermon on the Mount

161
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,420
 that we're gonna talk about this summer,

162
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,560
 you would have gotten this riddle right,

163
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,640
 'cause the answer is nothing.

164
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,760
 There's nothing greater than God.

165
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,880
 He is abounding in loving kindness.

166
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,000
 He is slow to anger.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,520
 He is rich in mercy, and he loves you.

168
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,180
 I'm gonna tell you what God would do

169
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,760
 if he kicked the door open on the four years of silence

170
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,840
 where your little teenage, hormone-enhanced,

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,600
 rebellious life had gone, where there was no reproof,

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,960
 no correction, no training in righteousness,

173
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,740
 in that darkest moment you've lived in,

174
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,620
 or worse yet, that darkest moment of fantasy

175
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,920
 or temptation that came into your mind

176
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,720
 that you thought, I wonder if that would be the way to go,

177
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,240
 if that became an actual reality and God showed up,

178
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,560
 I'm gonna tell you what he would say to you,

179
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,200
 because tonight, you're about to hear

180
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,580
 the very first words of God after 400 years of nothing.

181
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,320
 Even more, let me tell you the last words he left you with.

182
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,400
 The way the Old Testament ended

183
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,240
 is in Malachi chapter four, verses five and six.

184
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,720
 And he said, "Listen, behold, you wretches.

185
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
 "I am going to send you Elijah the prophet,

186
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,880
 "'cause you need a prophet.

187
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,640
 "A prophet is going to speak to you

188
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,240
 "about the things of God, and he is gonna come to you

189
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,500
 "before the coming and the great

190
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,340
 "and the terrible day of the Lord.

191
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,100
 "And he's gonna let you know what God is like, man.

192
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,620
 "He's gonna tell you to get right.

193
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,780
 "And he's gonna tell you,

194
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,980
 "you better restore yourself to righteousness.

195
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,680
 "You better get your act together,

196
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,700
 "'cause one of these days,

197
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,040
 "your worst nightmare is gonna happen.

198
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,360
 "That door's gonna fly open, the light's gonna be on,

199
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,880
 "and he's gonna be watching you,

200
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,540
 "and he's gonna catch you red-handed.

201
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,120
 "And dude, if the prophet didn't get you turned around,

202
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
 "you look out."

203
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,800
 See, this is the way we think of God.

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
 He says in verse six of Malachi,

205
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,360
 this is the very last verse of your Old Testament.

206
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,640
 He says, "Behold, what I'm gonna do

207
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,480
 "is restore the hearts of fathers to children,

208
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,700
 "and children to the hearts to that of their fathers,

209
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,480
 "and watch this, so that I will not come

210
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,820
 "and smite the land with a curse."

211
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,420
 Let me tell you what most of us think God would say

212
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,540
 if he came barging in at that particular moment

213
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,400
 that we are most embarrassed as a part of our story.

214
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,240
 Are you ready?

215
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,540
 I want you to listen.

216
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,300
 You're sitting there, I want you to think

217
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,440
 about a SWAT team, boom, boom.

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,020
 And this is what he's gonna do.

219
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,740
 Hey.

220
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,980
 Hey.

221
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,540
 And I love you.

222
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,660
 And I know guilt and shame is all over you right now.

223
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,440
 And I know you can't believe that your life

224
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,060
 got to this place where you would do this,

225
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,060
 and that others might know that that's who you really are,

226
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,900
 but I know that's who you really are.

227
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,140
 And I know you're not happy.

228
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,160
 I know you want from this room to another room,

229
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,940
 from darkness to greater darkness still.

230
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,940
 I know you don't want anybody to know what's going on.

231
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,660
 I know you try and numb yourself sometimes.

232
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,260
 There's tracts in your arm, there's pills in your stomach.

233
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,540
 There's alcohol on your breath.

234
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,340
 There's men on your left, men on your right.

235
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,740
 There's women on top of you.

236
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,900
 Trying to cover up all the sadness that's in your life.

237
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,860
 I'm not mad at you.

238
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,920
 You're my little girl.

239
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,160
 You're my son that was destined to be a king.

240
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,520
 You wanna be happy?

241
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,360
 You want your life to be something you're proud of?

242
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,440
 I'm not here to kick your tail.

243
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,520
 I'm here to give you exceeding blessing.

244
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,020
 Can you imagine if what I just said was true?

245
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,380
 Can you imagine if that's who God was?

246
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,280
 And Matthew 5 is that story.

247
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,260
 Because into the middle of a humanity

248
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,180
 that had run far away from him,

249
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,280
 that did not believe that he was good,

250
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,220
 that did not look to his word for instruction,

251
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,340
 that believed the lie, that his word was not true,

252
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,140
 that disobeying him was not that big a deal,

253
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,860
 that God is not where you can find life,

254
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,140
 he finally showed up and the worst fears of man

255
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,040
 were realized, where into the darkness came a great light.

256
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,660
 And he wasn't here to curse you.

257
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,080
 He's here to tell you that he loves you.

258
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,660
 Now make no mistake, this God who loves you

259
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,420
 is a God of righteousness and holiness.

260
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,780
 And there is a wage for sin,

261
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
 but he is here to make provision for that

262
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,200
 which has distanced you from God,

263
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,420
 which has distanced you from good,

264
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,300
 that has left you in darkness and great guilt and shame.

265
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,580
 And he is here to tell you that if you'll just listen

266
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,100
 and come out of the darkness and walk towards him,

267
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,320
 through the door that he's going to create,

268
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,820
 that there is blessing.

269
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,220
 Let me ask you a trivia question.

270
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,540
 What is the largest number of people,

271
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,620
 according to the Guinness Book of World Records,

272
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,800
 that have ever danced, one danced,

273
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,740
 in a synchronized way at one time?

274
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,860
 I'll give you a little hint.

275
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,480
 It happened in 1996 at Yankee Stadium.

276
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,500
 So I want you to go back,

277
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,660
 I know if you could just do the math,

278
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,580
 if I could do the math, that makes it 19 today

279
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,860
 if you were born then.

280
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,120
 Let's just say that there's a few folks

281
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,180
 that were seven years old when that world record was set,

282
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,980
 if the average age in this room is 26.

283
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
 I know some of you all are like,

284
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,580
 well dude, I ain't quite even born yet,

285
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,860
 I was 97 right here, all right?

286
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,260
 Snuck in a little early tonight.

287
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,600
 But there's others of you,

288
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
 there's others of you that at least were seven

289
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,680
 and you heard the song and you have done the dance

290
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,160
 that 50,000 people did together in 1996.

291
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,660
 Anybody want to take a venture?

292
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,040
 Hey!

293
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,500
 Macarena, baby, all right?

294
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,600
 All right, come on, let's give it a little bit.

295
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,760
 (mumbles)

296
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,280
 Hey!

297
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,120
 There we go, baby.

298
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,640
 All right, now look, I'm gonna tell you something.

299
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,720
 The reason that that ministers to me

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,300
 is because I know what Macarena means.

301
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,880
 Macarena is Spanish, any Spanish speakers here?

302
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,760
 Raise your hand, you got some Spanish speakers right here?

303
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,700
 All right, very good.

304
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,200
 Anybody want to tell me what Macarena, it's a name.

305
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,360
 Anybody know what that name means?

306
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,520
 (mumbles)

307
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,040
 It means mother of God.

308
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,440
 It's like the name Maria,

309
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,320
 it's got the same root word as the name Maria or Mary.

310
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,880
 It means beautiful one, it means mother of God.

311
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,560
 There was a flamenco dancer,

312
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,400
 not a flamingo who danced, all right?

313
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,520
 But go read your little Spanish literature books.

314
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,800
 A flamenco dancer, think tambourines and beautiful dresses

315
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,880
 and hey Macarena, all right?

316
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,600
 And this dancer, okay, was so beautiful

317
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
 that there were a couple of guys

318
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,120
 that are famous pop flamenco singers,

319
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,320
 they were part of called Los Del Rio, okay?

320
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,360
 That went down there and they saw Diana Patricia dancing

321
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,840
 and they go, that is the most beautiful woman

322
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,240
 they've ever seen and so they wrote a song about her

323
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,040
 and in the song, they called her this beautiful woman,

324
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,540
 she is so beautiful, she's like the mother of God.

325
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,680
 And that song is about a bunch of people

326
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,680
 celebrating the beauty that must be the mother of God.

327
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,840
 Now let me just let you in on a little secret.

328
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,960
 There is no mother of God.

329
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,360
 God always was and always will be.

330
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 Now we do know that Mary was the earthly mother of Jesus

331
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,960
 that the Holy Spirit made great with child

332
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,080
 and brought into the world

333
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,640
 in order that he might identify with us

334
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,040
 in our guilt and shame and sin and death

335
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,160
 and the darkness that was in the world

336
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,960
 and yet his father was not a man,

337
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
 his father was the heavenly father

338
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,440
 that put the seed of life inside Mary

339
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,200
 so that he was not just fully man but fully God

340
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,280
 and because he was not just fully man

341
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,400
 but because he was fully God,

342
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,860
 he was not only able not to sin,

343
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,160
 he was not able to sin because he was God himself

344
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,200
 but he was able as a man to be fully tempted

345
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,660
 in every ways you and I have been

346
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,120
 but because he was fully God,

347
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
 he was tempted in every ways you and I have been

348
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,240
 and yet without sin so that when we come to him

349
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,400
 in the midst of that which draws us to darkness

350
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,160
 and sin and shame, he will not in any way spurn us

351
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,520
 but he goes, I get it man, I've been there,

352
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,320
 I know what it's like to be tempted

353
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,200
 but because I didn't sin, I was able to pay a debt

354
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,040
 that you had to sin so that you, blessed one,

355
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,920
 can be happy and so you don't have to shrink back

356
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,440
 in guilt and shame but so that you might dance.

357
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,160
 Now what would you do if I told you

358
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,800
 that the God of the universe who is righteous

359
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,400
 and holy altogether who knew about you and your sin,

360
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
 when he kicked the door open, boom,

361
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,520
 the light came in, was on his knees and he said,

362
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,520
 hey, hey, I love you.

363
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,760
 I'm not here to smite you and curse you, come here.

364
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,840
 You wanna be happy, I mean really happy,

365
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,120
 I'm not talking about just a high,

366
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,120
 I'm not talking about PCPC, I'm not talking about an orgasm.

367
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,880
 I'm not talking about a codependent relationship,

368
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,040
 man, I'm talking about, do you want life?

369
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,760
 Come here.

370
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,640
 That is Matthew five, bro, that is the sermon on the mat.

371
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,280
 Now let me just make a few things clear to you here

372
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,780
 and I'm gonna tell you why I take you to what it says

373
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,160
 in Hey Macarena because the word right there

374
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,620
 in Matthew chapter five, verse three,

375
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,480
 when Jesus starts talking, the very first time

376
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,660
 God speaks after 400 years of silence,

377
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,400
 the very first words out of his mouth

378
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,640
 in the language of your New Testament is Macarias.

379
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,160
 Ever heard anything that sound like that before?

380
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
 The word Macarias in the Greek,

381
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,360
 it means supreme blessedness, exalted happiness.

382
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
 You guys ever heard speakers like me,

383
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,280
 they get up here and they go,

384
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,640
 God doesn't want you to be happy.

385
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,640
 Happy's root word is happenings and it's conditional.

386
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,620
 God wants you to be joyful, not happy.

387
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,000
 You ever heard that?

388
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,680
 Can I just tell y'all something?

389
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,360
 I've said that before too 'cause there's times

390
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,080
 it's convenient and it helps me make a point

391
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,920
 but let me just say this to you.

392
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,400
 God wants you to be happy.

393
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,580
 It's the very first words that he speaks.

394
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,200
 It's like Pharaoh Williams is incarnate all over again

395
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
 and he says, hey man, let's do the happy song

396
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 and it's over here with me.

397
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,240
 Let's go.

398
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,000
 And what he's saying is, hey man,

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,440
 you know that circumstance you're in called sin and death,

400
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,560
 the one that you followed the liar who came to steal,

401
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,540
 kill and destroy and he's stolen your sense of dignity

402
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,200
 and he's killed your sense of hope

403
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,640
 and he's destroyed your self-respect?

404
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 I am here to stomp on his head and set you free.

405
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,080
 Now that, folks, ought to make you dance.

406
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,720
 And that's why heaven's a party.

407
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,760
 It's not because we met some beautiful flamenco dancer

408
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,200
 in Venezuela, it's because we've met the God of the universe

409
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,360
 and we're singing for who he really is.

410
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,560
 And his first words are, hey, Macarena, man,

411
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,580
 you wanna dance, you wanna be happy?

412
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,600
 You wanna be filled with supreme blessedness,

413
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,580
 exalted happiness?

414
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,520
 I love that that's what the name Mary means.

415
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,580
 You must be supremely blessed among women

416
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,280
 if God chose to use your womb to bring forth

417
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,360
 the hope of the world.

418
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,880
 And that's why Mary means that.

419
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,680
 It's where the root word comes from.

420
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,360
 Let me just walk you through this real quick.

421
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,420
 We're gonna study the Sermon on the Mount this summer

422
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,440
 and this is what's gonna go on.

423
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,280
 This is an amazing thing.

424
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,400
 It's just 107 verses.

425
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,460
 You could read the whole thing through in 15 to 20 minutes.

426
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,760
 2,416 words is all it is.

427
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,120
 It covers everything from blessedness to morality

428
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,680
 to righteousness to responsibility to anxiety

429
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,000
 to materialism to discernment to humility,

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,040
 judgmentalism, how to pray, who false prophets are,

431
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,940
 what to do when you're stuck in dead religion,

432
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,360
 what generosity really looks like, what purity really is,

433
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,320
 how relationships work, what the golden rule of life is

434
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,600
 and where the ultimate source of life can be found

435
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,000
 in 107 verses.

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,560
 It is probably one of the most famous messages ever given

437
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,400
 and we're gonna look at it for 10 to 11 weeks.

438
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,240
 And man, you don't wanna miss it

439
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,960
 because at the center of this is a God

440
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,280
 who's kicking the door open after all kinds of silence.

441
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,460
 And some of you guys are still locked up in darkness

442
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,680
 and guilt and shame and I hope God kicks in your heart

443
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,880
 tonight and you hear me say to you, man, come here.

444
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,560
 I'm not mad, I didn't come to curse you.

445
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,600
 I'm gonna curse sin.

446
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,160
 But let me tell you something.

447
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,720
 I'm gonna pay the debt for sin

448
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,240
 and if you want sinner to be set free,

449
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,720
 I'm your daddy, man, and I'm not mad at you.

450
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,560
 I've just been looking for you.

451
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,640
 And those guys that said they love you,

452
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,480
 you know they don't love you

453
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,060
 'cause they're gone into another room

454
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,260
 finding some other girl to numb their pain.

455
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,220
 This is your daddy, come here.

456
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,320
 Let me make you whole.

457
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,060
 Come here, princess.

458
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,940
 Make you like a virgin.

459
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,620
 Come here, lost son who eats the slop of pigs.

460
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,520
 I'll make you a king again, come here.

461
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,420
 Now folks, if that was true,

462
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,180
 would we not just break out in song?

463
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,180
 Would we not go, hey, blessed happiness?

464
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,040
 (congregation laughing)

465
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,880
 Yes, we would.

466
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,560
 And that's what he's doing.

467
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,720
 All right, when you think Mount,

468
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
 okay, we're an American, we think Mount,

469
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,960
 we think Pikes Peak, we think Everest.

470
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,520
 Don't think that.

471
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,160
 This is a little hill.

472
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,760
 Fort Worth, think Tandy Hill.

473
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,600
 If you're in Fort Worth

474
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,520
 and you don't know where Tandy Hill is,

475
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,420
 go two miles to the east of your city.

476
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,320
 You can see most of Fort Worth from there.

477
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,240
 It's a beautiful view and a very rugged part of that city.

478
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,320
 If you're in Dallas, think Flagpole Hill.

479
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,400
 That's where he's hanging out.

480
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,280
 That's roughly what it is.

481
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,000
 Maybe a little bit bigger than Flagpole Hill,

482
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,160
 but that's basically what the mountains

483
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,920
 around the Sea of Galilee are.

484
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,680
 And that's where we're sitting, right there.

485
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
 And Jesus has been doing all kinds of things.

486
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,680
 And he had been presenting himself as powerful,

487
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,720
 able to do things that no mere man can do.

488
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,880
 And folks now are starting to go,

489
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,920
 hey, let's hear more about who this guy is.

490
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,600
 And he's about to open his mouth

491
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,440
 to folks who wanna learn more from him

492
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
 for the very first time.

493
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,440
 And what do you think he's gonna say?

494
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,160
 Better get cleaned up, Jack.

495
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,360
 You better stop that.

496
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,040
 No.

497
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,200
 You just wanna be happy?

498
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,120
 Well, I'm here.

499
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,880
 'Cause I know your life ain't happening right now.

500
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,320
 I know you're trying to numb yourself.

501
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
 Still, some of you guys are new to Dallas.

502
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,440
 It's summer, man.

503
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,200
 And you think that the stockyards in lower Greenville

504
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,840
 is where you can find Macarius.

505
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,560
 And some of you guys have hung out there

506
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,520
 for a while already, and you know it isn't Macarius.

507
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,360
 It's a mess.

508
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,160
 But you think you're so messed up

509
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,640
 that there's no way that you could ever have

510
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,120
 a relationship with a God who is holy.

511
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,840
 And I'm here to bust down that door tonight

512
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,080
 and tell you you're wrong.

513
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 What this little thing does,

514
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,680
 this little sermon on the map,

515
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,280
 this little story we're gonna look at tonight,

516
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,120
 it's gonna walk you through.

517
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,520
 It's gonna be very simple.

518
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
 What he's gonna do, he's gonna tell you

519
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
 how you can have a relationship with God.

520
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,760
 He's gonna tell you what a relationship with God looks like.

521
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
 He's gonna tell you, you wanna live

522
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,000
 in the place of blessedness,

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,680
 because if God's got a land, and he is king of that land,

524
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,120
 how would you describe that land?

525
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,280
 You would say it is a supremely blessed place

526
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
 of exalted happiness.

527
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,920
 And that's what Jesus is saying here.

528
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,240
 He's coming alongside of you, and he's saying, here we go.

529
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
 And so what you're gonna find out,

530
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,840
 if you wanna map this thing out,

531
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,880
 I hope you guys bring your Bibles here,

532
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,800
 and you can learn something.

533
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,200
 Let me just bring you a Bible.

534
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,600
 And you can learn something.

535
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
 Let me just break this out for you,

536
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,920
 this first little, really, verses from Matthew 5:3

537
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,520
 down through Matthew 5:12.

538
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,640
 You're gonna basically get this.

539
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
 Who is saved?

540
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,720
 Who can actually have a friendship with the Father?

541
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,680
 He's gonna answer that in verses three, four, five, and six.

542
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,240
 This is the kind of person

543
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,800
 that is going to be a friend of God.

544
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,040
 So if you ever wanted to know, in all your wretchedness,

545
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,600
 in all your rebellion, how to become a friend of God,

546
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,920
 I'm gonna show you in four short verses

547
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,320
 how that can happen.

548
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,160
 And then, after that, I'm gonna tell you

549
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,720
 what you will look like if you are, in fact,

550
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,640
 those four things that he talks about.

551
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,840
 And so, who is saved?

552
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,000
 What they look like?

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,840
 And then you're gonna get to verse nine,

554
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,880
 and you're gonna find out what they do.

555
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,840
 And then you're gonna find out, in verse nine,

556
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,920
 or verse 10, what you should expect

557
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,000
 as you endure certain things.

558
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,240
 And then you're gonna find out

559
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,000
 what you should expect ultimately.

560
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,920
 So here we go, you ready?

561
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,800
 Let's take a look.

562
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,920
 Macarius, man.

563
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,600
 Hey, blessedness.

564
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,520
 Blessed are the poor in spirit,

565
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,960
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

566
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,560
 The very first words out of his mouth is,

567
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,680
 you wanna know how you can have a relationship with God.

568
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,640
 And here's the thing.

569
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,080
 This is a shattering verse.

570
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,560
 Because when you were thought of in that day and age

571
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,280
 of being somebody that was rightly related to God,

572
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,720
 you always thought prosperity,

573
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,000
 just like false teachers today will tell you,

574
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
 that people who are right with God

575
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,560
 are gonna be filled with health, wealth, and prosperity.

576
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,320
 And that's why there's certain guys

577
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,520
 that they trumpet their wealth,

578
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,440
 they exploit their people,

579
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
 and they tell 'em, you give money to God,

580
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,920
 and he's likely to bless you.

581
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,240
 And the more money that's given,

582
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,840
 the more their pockets are feathered,

583
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,280
 the nicer the cars they drive in,

584
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,680
 the bigger the land they live in,

585
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,960
 and they can go, see, I'm God's man,

586
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,360
 look at all the blessing I've got.

587
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,920
 If you keep doing God's work

588
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,600
 by giving to God's man in ministry,

589
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,680
 you'll be blessed too.

590
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,600
 And there's always somebody that their life turns around,

591
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,400
 and they'll drag them up on stage,

592
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,320
 and as P.T. Barnum and Bailey said,

593
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,080
 there's a sucker born every minute.

594
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,840
 And you think, well, maybe I'm the next one.

595
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,440
 Maybe I'm the one that can just give

596
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,080
 a little pledge gift of this much.

597
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,640
 Because if I do this, maybe God's gonna set me up

598
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,840
 with riches here on earth.

599
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,960
 That's not the idea.

600
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,760
 And the Pharisees were individuals

601
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,720
 that trumpeted their wealth,

602
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,320
 that trumpeted their high position,

603
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,600
 that trumpeted their righteousness,

604
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,240
 and they were rich in spirit.

605
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,280
 They were filled with dignity and education.

606
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,360
 And they thought it was a sign

607
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,960
 that they were favorably related to God.

608
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,080
 And Jesus is gonna come,

609
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,160
 and he's gonna flip the entire thing on its head,

610
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,280
 and he's gonna say, that's not the people

611
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,440
 that you need to be,

612
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,160
 if in fact you're rightly related to me.

613
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,280
 And in fact, in verse 20 of this very first chapter

614
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,800
 on the Sermon on the Mount,

615
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
 Jesus says this, I'm gonna tell you something.

616
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
 Unless your righteousness is more than the Pharisees,

617
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,520
 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.

618
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,000
 Now, if you hear that, you're like, are you kidding me?

619
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,920
 Unless I'm more righteous than Mother Teresa

620
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,280
 and Billy Graham's love child,

621
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,520
 I don't have a chance?

622
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,000
 Well, then I'm just gonna check out

623
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
 and figure out something else that I can do.

624
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,000
 It's why every single religion of the world

625
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,680
 always has a system for you to jump into,

626
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,240
 because that's what makes sense to us,

627
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,040
 is if God is holy, we gotta be at least holier

628
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,600
 than more people, so that maybe,

629
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
 'cause he can't send all of us to hell,

630
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,480
 so I just gotta at least beat the curve,

631
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,960
 and so I gotta not be an individual that is a wretch,

632
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,640
 and at least I gotta be better than that guy,

633
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,200
 and that is why when you ask natural man

634
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,720
 if he thinks he's gonna go to heaven,

635
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,040
 he'll always say, well, I mean, I don't know, I hope so.

636
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,720
 I mean, I'm not Hitler.

637
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,280
 Which I'm like, way to go, way to set your bar

638
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,600
 really high there, champ.

639
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,600
 But that's what we do, we always look at somebody else

640
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,760
 who's not as good as us, and we think,

641
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,320
 well, I don't know, but Hitler's not,

642
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,200
 and I'm better than him, so maybe I got a chance,

643
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,440
 and we always compare our righteousness to others,

644
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,840
 and we don't see ourself as in great need

645
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
 against the standard.

646
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,560
 He says, unless your righteousness surpasses

647
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,260
 that of the Pharisees, man, you're not gonna make it.

648
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,760
 And then if that's not enough, 28 verses later,

649
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,360
 he says this, hey, here's the deal,

650
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,960
 you should be perfect like your heavenly father is perfect.

651
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,480
 And that's when you're like, okay, what the heck?

652
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,840
 I am gone.

653
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,480
 Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no, listen to me.

654
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,520
 I'm gonna tell you who is saved.

655
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,440
 And what's amazing is that Jesus doesn't tell you

656
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,240
 what you have to do with your hands to build a resume.

657
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
 He says, this is what you've gotta do with your heart

658
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,440
 to be righteous.

659
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,400
 Did you catch that?

660
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,360
 Jesus is gonna say what makes you righteous is your heart.

661
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,080
 In fact, a little bit later, when he gets to Mark,

662
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,480
 chapter seven, he says, I'll tell you

663
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,360
 what makes a man filthy.

664
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
 It's not his adulteries and his idolatries

665
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,200
 and his immoralities.

666
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,480
 All those things are evidence from what is within.

667
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
 What makes a man sick is his heart.

668
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,080
 His heart is desperately sick and deceitful of all else,

669
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,300
 to quote a prophet from the Old Testament.

670
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,080
 And so what Jesus is trying to do is set your heart straight.

671
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,000
 Let me just give you a little story.

672
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,360
 It comes in Luke, chapter 18.

673
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
 See, now look, I wanna show you this.

674
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,160
 This is not just the Jews who are always trying

675
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,080
 to follow the law, always trying to be obedient

676
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,120
 to the commandments.

677
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,280
 This happens all the way around in Hinduism.

678
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,040
 If you're not born to the right caste system,

679
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,800
 if you're not part of the Brahmins,

680
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,320
 then, man, you ain't got a chance.

681
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,280
 You gotta figure out a way to work your way up through karma,

682
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,520
 live your life good enough now so that in the next life,

683
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,360
 you can be born up.

684
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,760
 If you're a Dalit, you gotta become a Sudra.

685
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,160
 If you're a Sudra, you gotta become a Vashia.

686
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,080
 If you're a Vashia, you gotta become a Shatryas.

687
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,000
 If you're a Shatryas, you gotta become a Brahmin

688
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,120
 and work your way up.

689
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,040
 And so in this life, if you didn't do so well,

690
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,440
 let's go to the next life and then the next life

691
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,920
 and the next life, and eventually,

692
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,120
 maybe your life will be good enough.

693
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,160
 You'll be one of the highly exalted priests,

694
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,400
 one of the highly exalted ones,

695
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,860
 and you can just clap yourself right up to be a god.

696
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,780
 That's Hinduism or Sikhism.

697
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,720
 How about Buddhism?

698
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,260
 Hey, here's the eightfold path of enlightenment.

699
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,100
 How about Islam?

700
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,000
 Hey, here's the five pillars of Islam.

701
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,840
 Hey, how about this?

702
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,560
 Here's the seven sacraments that'll make you holy.

703
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,720
 And here's the New Testament.

704
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,000
 For by grace,

705
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,540
 you are saved.

706
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:08,080
 It's a gift from God through faith,

707
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,440
 and that's not of your own,

708
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
 not even as a result of works

709
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,800
 so that no man should boast you,

710
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,900
 not as a result of works.

711
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,740
 I thought it was all about my resume.

712
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,100
 And Jesus is saying, "It's all about your heart."

713
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,300
 And he's just saying to you,

714
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,280
 "Do you know what your heart is?

715
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,380
 "Your heart is wicked.

716
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,240
 "Your heart has left me.

717
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,400
 "Your heart doesn't believe that I'm good."

718
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,840
 When you're asked the question,

719
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,120
 what is greater than God,

720
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,960
 you don't stop right there,

721
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
 you don't need to say anything else.

722
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,800
 I've already got the answer to the riddle.

723
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,960
 Nothing's greater than God.

724
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,000
 God alone is good.

725
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,280
 I'm not greater than God.

726
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,440
 There's a way that seems right to me,

727
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,800
 but every time I go my own way,

728
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,040
 the way it happens for me,

729
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,160
 it leads to death.

730
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,760
 See, this is our problem.

731
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,280
 When I ask you this riddle,

732
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,300
 what is greater than God,

733
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
 you start thinking, "Well, I don't know, sex.

734
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,760
 "I don't know, a really good new movie

735
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,120
 "with my friends and buttered popcorn

736
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,240
 "and two hours of distraction.

737
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,840
 "Well, I don't know, a great job.

738
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,000
 "I don't know, a cute girlfriend.

739
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,800
 "I don't know, an awesome wedding."

740
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,480
 And I'm going, "No, man,

741
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,280
 "I'll tell you what's greater than God.

742
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,820
 "Nothing."

743
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,300
 And so if I can know him, man,

744
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,620
 that alone, if I can be intimate with God,

745
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,100
 my life will be Macarius.

746
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,340
 I'll be blessed.

747
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,000
 But here's the thing, my heart is desperately sick

748
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,100
 and deceitful above all else.

749
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,060
 Look at Luke 18.

750
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,620
 It says, "Jesus told this parable to some people

751
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,820
 "who trusted in themselves,

752
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,100
 "who weren't poor in spirit.

753
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,540
 "They were rich in their own righteousness,

754
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,780
 "that they were righteous,

755
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,380
 "and they viewed others with contempt.

756
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,640
 "Two men went up to the temple to pray,

757
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,800
 "one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

758
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,100
 "Tax collectors were thieves.

759
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,240
 "They were traitors."

760
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,640
 It says, "The Pharisee stood and was praying this

761
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
 "to himself, 'God, I thank you that I am not

762
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,840
 "'like other people, swindlers, unjust,

763
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,460
 "'adulterers, lower Greenville idiots.'"

764
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,820
 Folks that are down at the stockyards,

765
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,840
 drinking it up, doing more than two-stepping.

766
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,420
 "God, I thank you I'm not like them.

767
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,040
 "I'm a churchman.

768
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,160
 "I fast twice a week, I pay tithes of all that I got."

769
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,480
 But watch this.

770
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
 "But the tax collector,

771
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,300
 "standing some distance away," watch this,

772
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,780
 "was unwilling to even lift up his eyes.

773
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,960
 "He was beating his breast,

774
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,080
 "saying, 'God, be merciful on me, a sinner.'"

775
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,380
 See, one guy thought when God kicked the door open,

776
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,060
 he'd find him there, going back over his taxes

777
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,960
 and counting up all that he gave this year to the temple.

778
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,200
 Writing a book report about all the good deeds he had done.

779
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,860
 And the other guy knows when that light comes on

780
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,900
 and that door was kicked open,

781
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,440
 that there was a lot there that shouldn't be.

782
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,280
 And see, the Pharisee was comparing himself

783
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,260
 to the tax collector, because they were in the same room

784
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,620
 called humanity and earth.

785
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,580
 But what the Pharisee didn't realize

786
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,320
 is what he was to compare himself to

787
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,020
 was not the tax collector, but to the holiness of God.

788
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,540
 And the truth is, is that both of them

789
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,060
 needed to put their head in shame.

790
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,860
 And say, "I got no resume at the standard of perfection,

791
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,480
 "'cause I'm a sinner.

792
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,220
 "'I'm filled with pride, hatred for my fellow man,

793
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,320
 "'self-exaltation, and self-righteousness.

794
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,740
 "'And those are not things consistent

795
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,300
 "'with the character and nature of God.

796
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,100
 "'Blessed are the poor in spirit.'"

797
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,140
 And what's he telling you here?

798
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,120
 He's telling you, "These are people

799
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,520
 "that can be rightly related to me,

800
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,580
 "people that know that they are bankrupt,

801
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,460
 "that there is no eightfold path,

802
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,700
 "there is no karma they can build up,

803
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,220
 "there is no five pillars,

804
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,800
 "there is no sacrament that they can accomplish,

805
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,500
 "there is no resume, man."

806
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,660
 'Cause their resume is this, "I'm a sinner.

807
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,380
 "And the wages of sin is death, that's all I got."

808
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,980
 Now listen, some of you guys in your room

809
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,220
 in your worst moment, you weren't a pedophile.

810
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,260
 Some of y'all weren't pornographers.

811
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,240
 Some of y'all weren't murdering children.

812
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,080
 But I've never been anywhere in a room

813
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,300
 where I said, "Is there anybody in this room

814
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,460
 "that thinks they're without sin?"

815
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,860
 That somebody went, (whistles)

816
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,700
 "I'm a sinner."

817
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,580
 Never been there.

818
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,300
 In fact, you know what's amazing about Jesus?

819
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,460
 Jesus, at one time, in the face of his enemies,

820
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,900
 a little bit later in the story,

821
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,700
 they were accusing him of blaspheming.

822
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,560
 And he says, "Hey man, if you don't believe my words,

823
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,020
 "why don't you just look at what I do?

824
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,060
 "In fact, has anybody here ever seen me do anything wrong?"

825
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,460
 (laughs)

826
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,860
 And because he wasn't just born of the beautiful one Mary,

827
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,940
 because he was born of God, guess what they all did?

828
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,780
 They were silent.

829
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,460
 Nobody could say he had done anything wrong.

830
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,380
 He'd been tempted in every way as you and I have been,

831
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,420
 yet he's without sin.

832
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,100
 (exhales)

833
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,940
 That's your God.

834
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,540
 You wanna be saved?

835
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,380
 This is how you're saved.

836
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,180
 You know that you're morally and spiritually bankrupt.

837
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,020
 You got nothing.

838
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,840
 Blessed are those who mourn.

839
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,680
 In fact, you're so bankrupt that all you do

840
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,460
 is you put your head down and you weep and go,

841
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,520
 "God, if you kick in that door

842
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,720
 "and you shine your light on what I've done,

843
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,640
 "not only do I have a resume that's not righteous,

844
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,340
 "I got a resume that is wretched."

845
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,960
 And man, I get it, I deserve judgment.

846
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
 (laughs)

847
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,560
 But the people that are brokenhearted

848
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,760
 and just saying, "God, if you're there, if you're good,

849
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,400
 "if there's any way you can restore your little girl

850
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,000
 "that's left you and spurned your ways,

851
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,900
 "man, Dad, if you're really a king and I'm a prince,

852
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,800
 "if there's anything you can do to come in

853
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,960
 "and restore the glory that I have lost, man,

854
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,020
 "but I mourn at what I've done to your name

855
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,680
 "and what I've done to your relationship."

856
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:31,280
 Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.

857
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,080
 That word right there, humble and meek,

858
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,720
 is the word for gentle, it's the same word.

859
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,400
 It's a word that so many people misunderstand

860
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,640
 because when you hear the word meek,

861
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,240
 blessed are the meek, you kind of think of Mr. Rogers,

862
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,040
 right, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

863
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,160
 Or you think, maybe you think of the wrong view of Jesus,

864
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,880
 like he puts a little lamb around his neck,

865
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,960
 he picks flowers, he quotes poetry.

866
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,720
 Hey man, you need to get another view of Jesus.

867
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,920
 This is no weak, meek man, this is a man

868
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
 among men, this is a guy who's taken on

869
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,560
 the greatest authority in the world.

870
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,000
 He's not flinching when they tell him

871
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,560
 that they think that they can save him

872
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,280
 because he knows exactly who he is.

873
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,080
 What he is though, is he is a man that knows God,

874
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,680
 and he is strong, and when he is reviled,

875
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,520
 he doesn't need to revile in return

876
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,280
 because he knows there's one who judges rightly

877
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
 and he's got his back.

878
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,960
 And so when Pilate says, "Don't you know who I am?

879
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,520
 "Don't you know I can save you?"

880
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,280
 He leans up in his beaten state,

881
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,600
 he goes, "Let me tell you who I am, bro.

882
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,000
 "You've got no power over me.

883
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
 "You've got no power except my Father in Heaven

884
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,160
 "gave it to you, and he gave it to you

885
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,680
 "that you might in your deluded state,

886
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,920
 "in your cowardly state, who wants to be popular

887
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,640
 "and protected by the opinions of men,

888
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,560
 "be in a position where you can throw me on a cross,

889
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,520
 "but let me just tell you something,

890
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
 "you're not gonna put me on a cross, that's my cross.

891
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,160
 "I'm gonna lay my life down, and three days later,

892
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,600
 "I'm gonna take it back up again."

893
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,200
 Now you carry on, Pilate.

894
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,080
 That's your man.

895
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,080
 Can I tell you something beautiful?

896
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,240
 One of my favorite gifts I got,

897
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,720
 I turned 50 a couple years ago,

898
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
 and I got a lot of gifts for my 50th anniversary,

899
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,120
 but this is probably my favorite one of them.

900
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,960
 It's a children's book.

901
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,440
 I'm gonna read it to you tonight,

902
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,880
 'cause it's a right view of what it means to be gentle,

903
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,480
 and I want you to get a glimpse of this.

904
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,720
 It's not just 'cause it's a children's book,

905
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,480
 but because a guy wrote this in the front of it.

906
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,240
 He said, "Matthew 5:5, 'Blessed are the meek,

907
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
 "'for they will inherit the earth.'

908
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,040
 "And what do you give a man for his 50th birthday

909
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,240
 "when he has done so much for you?"

910
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,120
 A children's book, of course.

911
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,480
 This is a story, it's my story,

912
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,160
 of which you play a most important role.

913
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,600
 On January 19th, 2003,

914
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,880
 22 minutes and 10 seconds into your message,

915
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,760
 you told an abbreviated version of this book,

916
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,920
 and my heart held onto it at the Lord's beckoning.

917
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,680
 And then, just a few years later,

918
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,600
 as God continued through your words and others

919
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,200
 to work in my life, my life radically changed.

920
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,760
 You invited me, in fact, three years later,

921
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,360
 because of my radical transformation,

922
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,040
 to jump up and start to share parts of my story.

923
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,640
 You believed in me when you shouldn't have.

924
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,720
 Frankly, the Lord blessed me

925
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,080
 through your faithfulness and obedience.

926
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,680
 From you, I've learned the important lessons

927
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,120
 of trusting and obeying,

928
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
 that the Lord always knows, even if no one else does,

929
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,760
 that Pharaoh never misses his Joseph,

930
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,440
 that humility looks good on everyone.

931
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
 Don't go somewhere, be sent by someone,

932
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,480
 and we are not truly free

933
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,440
 until we are fully submissive to our masters,

934
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,520
 and so much more.

935
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,360
 Thank you for introducing me to my master.

936
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,200
 Watch this.

937
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
 Thank you for making me meek.

938
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
 This guy went on to write this.

939
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,320
 I'm gonna read you this story,

940
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,640
 and I'm gonna tell you who wrote that note.

941
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,240
 The story's called "Thunderhoof."

942
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,440
 Here's a picture of Thunderhoof right there, man.

943
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,280
 Look at him.

944
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,000
 Are you ready?

945
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,440
 Way out west, one great horse still ran wild.

946
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,040
 His name was Thunderhoof.

947
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,960
 (audience laughing)

948
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,280
 Cowboys tried to catch him, but he ran too fast for them.

949
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,680
 They got a rope around his neck, man.

950
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,520
 He shook it off.

951
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,240
 This was his stud, this was his stallion.

952
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,080
 It's Thunderhoof.

953
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,600
 Nobody will ever catch me, said Thunderhoof,

954
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,640
 and he went on running across the open range.

955
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,360
 Every night he slept under the blue sky.

956
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,040
 One day when Thunderhoof woke up, he found the rivers dry.

957
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,840
 There was no water to left to drink.

958
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,560
 He got so weak he could not run.

959
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,760
 He got so weak he could hardly walk.

960
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,840
 When a rope landed on his neck, he could not shake it off.

961
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,080
 You ever been there, man?

962
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
 When all your pride, you're running where you run,

963
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,320
 you can shake it off, but all of a sudden you're weak,

964
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,880
 and you're captive to something

965
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,560
 you never thought would catch you.

966
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,440
 Come with us, said some cowboys.

967
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
 They took Thunderhoof back to the ranch.

968
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,400
 They gave him water, man.

969
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,240
 They gave him hay.

970
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,080
 They brushed him.

971
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,900
 They rubbed his nose.

972
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,600
 They took the burrs out of his mane.

973
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,400
 And they said, "Nice horse.

974
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,680
 "Nice little fella."

975
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,440
 They put a saddle on Thunderhoof.

976
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,280
 They tried to ride him.

977
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,120
 Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

978
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,680
 Off went one cowboy.

979
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,840
 Now, you can put a carrot in my mouth.

980
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,680
 You can give me a sugar cube,

981
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,560
 but don't you saddle up, cowboy.

982
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,880
 Off went another cowboy.

983
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,280
 Nobody could ever stay on Thunderhoof very long.

984
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,360
 "It's no use keeping that horse," said the ranch owner.

985
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,340
 "We might as well turn him loose.

986
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,040
 "We're not gonna make him stay."

987
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,280
 They took the saddle off Thunderhoof,

988
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,840
 and they let him go, opened the gate, man.

989
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,360
 We're not gonna beat him.

990
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,920
 If Thunderhoof doesn't wanna get what we've got to give him,

991
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,760
 let him go.

992
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,600
 Thunderhoof went back to the open range.

993
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,160
 Once more, he ran wild.

994
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,680
 What do you think's gonna happen?

995
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,520
 Once more, he slept under the blue sky.

996
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,440
 He's free again.

997
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,360
 He's strong again.

998
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,420
 He been nursed back to health.

999
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,720
 But it rained.

1000
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,000
 There was water to drink.

1001
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,500
 But Thunderhoof was not happy.

1002
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:34,360
 He missed having someone brush him,

1003
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,960
 rub his nose, take the burrs out of his mane,

1004
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,280
 and say, "Nice horse.

1005
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,400
 "Nice old fellow."

1006
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,200
 Thunderhoof went back to the ranch.

1007
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,320
 He let them put that saddle on him.

1008
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,800
 This time, he let the cowboy ride him.

1009
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,940
 "I think I'll stay here," said Thunderhoof.

1010
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,740
 "I think I'll stay right here for good."

1011
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,500
 And he did.

1012
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,420
 And what he was created for, this source of strength

1013
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,180
 and glory to something greater than him,

1014
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,660
 where his beauty was fully known

1015
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,980
 and his strength was fully deployed,

1016
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,540
 became evident to all, and he was cared for

1017
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,420
 and loved and nursed to health and protected

1018
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,660
 and provided for in every way that he was created to be.

1019
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,580
 That's meekness, man.

1020
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,820
 You're still a stallion.

1021
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:28,100
 You don't stop being what God intended you to be,

1022
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,140
 but now all of a sudden, you're in relationship

1023
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,980
 with the one that can bring forward your glory.

1024
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,800
 And guess what?

1025
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,300
 He can take care of the burrs.

1026
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:38,080
 He can take care of that impoverished, cold,

1027
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,880
 empty, lonely way in the wind.

1028
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,300
 That's a little book that JP gave me on my 50th birthday.

1029
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,020
 And he said, "That's my story."

1030
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,280
 'Cause I thought I was a stallion on lower Greenville.

1031
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,620
 I thought I was a stallion down there in the stockyards.

1032
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,460
 I wasn't a stallion.

1033
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,960
 I was cold.

1034
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
 I had lots of burrs in my heart.

1035
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,500
 And I heard you talk about who God was and I believed you.

1036
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,800
 And he has set me free.

1037
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,020
 So when you think of what it means to be gentle,

1038
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,640
 I want you to think of the strength of this man

1039
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,920
 that God's using along with others that know God

1040
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,320
 to be a blessing in this city

1041
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,980
 and not destruction to some little girl's heart.

1042
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,920
 And it's a beautiful thing, amen?

1043
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,260
 Blessed are those who are gentle,

1044
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,740
 for they shall inherit the earth.

1045
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,460
 You wanna tell you, what do you think, man?

1046
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,420
 JP 2003 is doing something in Dallas or JP 2015?

1047
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:37,200
 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,

1048
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
 for they shall be satisfied.

1049
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,260
 Let me just say about this, man.

1050
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,260
 This is who is, this is what they look like, okay?

1051
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,160
 This is, who is saved are those who are poor in spirit

1052
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,900
 and know they're not righteous,

1053
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,060
 that weep over their sinful state

1054
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,660
 and that then just submit themselves to God.

1055
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,340
 That's who's saved.

1056
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,780
 Notice, I didn't talk a bit about what you had to do.

1057
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,860
 It's who you are.

1058
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,700
 You know that you are a sinner in the hand of an angry God

1059
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,820
 and you are finding out tonight

1060
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,460
 that what God is, is tender towards you.

1061
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,500
 And the door's kicked open, the light's coming in right now.

1062
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,700
 The first time he comes, he goes,

1063
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,100
 hey man, you wanna be happy?

1064
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,980
 Come here, man, saddle up.

1065
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,380
 Here's a little sugar.

1066
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,040
 Come here, shh, here's some water.

1067
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,620
 Let me refresh you.

1068
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,060
 He starts to show you his love.

1069
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,140
 If you wanna run away from him again,

1070
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,660
 if you wanna taste of his goodness and run back out,

1071
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,580
 he'll let you do it, Thunder Hook.

1072
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,340
 But there's gonna be a time when you just,

1073
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,660
 you just gently just lay yourself down in humility

1074
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,160
 and you just say, okay, Jesus,

1075
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,940
 I'm not gonna lean on my own understanding anymore,

1076
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,220
 but in all your way, all my ways,

1077
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,820
 I'm gonna acknowledge you.

1078
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,700
 That's the heart of somebody who's saved.

1079
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,940
 When somebody asks them a riddle,

1080
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,780
 what's greater than God?

1081
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,380
 You go, stop right there, nothing.

1082
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,720
 (congregation laughing)

1083
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,620
 So this is what they look like, man.

1084
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,140
 They hunger and thirst for righteousness.

1085
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,420
 And here's the amazing thing, they will be satisfied.

1086
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,260
 I wanna ask you this, man,

1087
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,460
 do you wanna know if you're saved?

1088
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,660
 Do you have a spiritual appetite?

1089
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,780
 Do you long for the pure milk of the word?

1090
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,400
 Did you come here 'cause you're hoping to meet some chick?

1091
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,240
 Some guy?

1092
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,380
 Hook up with some friends, have a good memory,

1093
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,820
 be numb from your pain, you T-boat your favorite show,

1094
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,900
 you'll get to go back and watch it,

1095
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,300
 but for a while you run with the crowd,

1096
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,660
 but you're not really looking to find life here,

1097
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,140
 you're looking to just continue running your program.

1098
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,520
 No, are you hunger and thirst for righteousness?

1099
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,540
 Are you longing to get in biblical community?

1100
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,740
 Do you want somebody to teach you more of your master?

1101
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,060
 Do you want, not like a horse with a bitten bridle,

1102
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,180
 but somebody who's just willingly listening

1103
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,980
 to the gentle coaxing of a master

1104
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,220
 to run where he tells you to run

1105
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,740
 and the meadows he tells you to run with

1106
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,980
 because you know that God is good

1107
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,620
 and every word you're just sitting there like,

1108
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,380
 speak to me, I wanna know more of you

1109
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,860
 because I know your kind.

1110
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,340
 That's what people who have wept over their sin

1111
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,020
 who are broken hearted about their sin

1112
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,460
 and impoverished without God, they know they are,

1113
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:55,140
 and who just say, not my will but your will be done.

1114
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,100
 That's who's saved.

1115
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,260
 And people who say that, they go, now tell me more.

1116
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,060
 You've told me how to get saved, now tell me how to live.

1117
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,940
 Tell me now how to pursue righteousness,

1118
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,180
 faith, love, and peace.

1119
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,060
 Show me others who pursue God from a pure heart.

1120
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,300
 That's what they look like.

1121
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,500
 That's what people who look like say.

1122
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,340
 Now notice what it says, they will be satisfied.

1123
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,900
 They will be satisfied.

1124
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,980
 Let me just do this to you real quickly.

1125
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,140
 Because here's the thing.

1126
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,980
 Sometimes we look at all the Thunderhursts

1127
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,820
 that are out there, man,

1128
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,020
 they're running around all these cities

1129
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,860
 and they're everywhere.

1130
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,620
 And we fret because of evil doers.

1131
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,460
 We are envious towards wrongdoers

1132
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,540
 'cause they're out there, they're getting after it.

1133
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,180
 They're breeding with every, you know,

1134
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,860
 mare on the range.

1135
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,420
 And the bigger stallion they are,

1136
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,740
 the more they bite the smaller ones

1137
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,780
 and they're just, and they're getting out of there.

1138
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,180
 And they're just, there's a stampede of sin

1139
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,180
 and rebellion and victory.

1140
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,620
 And you're like, that looks, I don't know, man.

1141
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,700
 But watch this, here's the thing.

1142
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,940
 Is it says when they run out there

1143
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,780
 and they're getting after it,

1144
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,740
 it says they will wither quickly like the grass.

1145
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,500
 You just keep watching Thunderhoof.

1146
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,220
 You watch how long Greenville satisfies them.

1147
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,060
 It doesn't, man.

1148
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,220
 They got to move on to darker and darker places.

1149
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,300
 They go to Deep Ellum.

1150
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,580
 All right.

1151
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,900
 And then they go to Lodebar, you know.

1152
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,260
 And then they just go to just real darkness

1153
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,300
 and they go, I can never get out of here.

1154
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,380
 (congregation laughing)

1155
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,540
 And they start piercing themselves and spacing themselves

1156
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,140
 and numbing themselves and tracking themselves

1157
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,500
 and tatting themselves and cutting themselves.

1158
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,020
 Just watch Thunderhoof, man.

1159
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,860
 You watch it.

1160
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,140
 But it says those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,

1161
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,460
 they'll be satisfied.

1162
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,820
 This is the amazing, this is Psalm 37.

1163
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,820
 It says, delight yourself in the Lord

1164
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,660
 and he will give you the desires of your heart.

1165
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,500
 In other words, nothing else will.

1166
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,940
 It doesn't mean if you seek God,

1167
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,780
 you're gonna get your car, you're gonna get your lady,

1168
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,660
 you're gonna get your job, you're gonna get your house.

1169
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,900
 No, it means you're gonna get the one thing

1170
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,580
 that the human heart really wants.

1171
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,620
 A loving master who whispers word of redemption

1172
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,940
 and life to you, who can heal you, who heals your diseases,

1173
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,500
 who renews your years like the eagle,

1174
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,420
 who redeems your life from the pit.

1175
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,260
 Bro.

1176
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,860
 But isn't this amazing?

1177
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,780
 This is the very first words that God speaks

1178
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,780
 when he comes crashing onto earth and we see God fully.

1179
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,220
 We've always heard about God.

1180
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,660
 We imagine what God was like, but now God is here.

1181
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,780
 He says, you wanna know what God is like?

1182
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,620
 Look at me.

1183
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,540
 You wanna hear God speak?

1184
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,620
 Listen to me speak.

1185
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,660
 I want you to be blessed.

1186
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,660
 Sin will not bless you.

1187
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,300
 Sin always leads to death.

1188
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,940
 I know you haven't felt the full sting of death yet,

1189
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,740
 Thunderhoof, but that's where you're headed, man.

1190
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,060
 To a desert.

1191
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,900
 Come here.

1192
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,740
 When it says, if you hunger and thirst after righteousness,

1193
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,100
 in other words, righteousness is what you were designed for.

1194
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,780
 It's why people who start to dabble in stuff

1195
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,180
 that's not righteous, when they try and meet

1196
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,180
 a God-given need in a God-forbidden way

1197
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,780
 or a legitimate need in an illegitimate way,

1198
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,940
 are never satisfied.

1199
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,100
 They always need more.

1200
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,540
 That's why sin always gets darker

1201
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,420
 and our imaginations run riot.

1202
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,020
 Psalm 106 says that God gives, Thunderhoof,

1203
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,700
 the desires of their heart,

1204
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,900
 but he sends leanness to their soul

1205
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,540
 because that food that they're eating

1206
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,780
 is not going to satisfy them.

1207
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,020
 Riddle, guess what happens if you eat sin?

1208
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,020
 It ain't nothing.

1209
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,340
 You die.

1210
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:17,060
 And because the hearts of men among them

1211
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,820
 see people eat sin and not die immediately,

1212
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,460
 they go, I guess it wasn't that bad, give me the apple.

1213
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,060
 But make no mistake, man.

1214
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,980
 You know, God, you were in a hunger for righteousness.

1215
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,260
 Do you want more of that?

1216
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,100
 That's the evidence, man.

1217
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,620
 If you're not seeing that, you're not saved

1218
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,220
 because you want righteous things.

1219
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,100
 The evidence that you've now got a different view of God

1220
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,540
 is that you run towards him.

1221
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,900
 Give me more of him.

1222
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,580
 Watch this, this is what else they do.

1223
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,660
 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

1224
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,100
 They're being changed, okay?

1225
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,340
 They have been forgiven much, and so they love much.

1226
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,940
 Jesus tells this story in Luke chapter seven, verse 36.

1227
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,940
 He was at a table with a Pharisee

1228
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,540
 and they're having a conversation.

1229
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,660
 And all of a sudden, some woman come crashing in.

1230
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,300
 And this woman saw Jesus reclining at the table.

1231
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,140
 She brought an alabaster vial full of perfume.

1232
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,540
 Standing between him and his feet, she starts weeping.

1233
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,420
 She began to wet his feet with her tears.

1234
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,700
 And she kept wiping them with her hair of her head,

1235
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,260
 the scripture says, kissing his feet.

1236
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,460
 I mean, how awkward is this scene, okay?

1237
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,860
 The way they used to eat, they'd be laying down like this.

1238
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,260
 There's Jesus, he took his shoes off

1239
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,100
 'cause he's a nice guest.

1240
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,160
 He left them at the door.

1241
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,620
 And in comes this woman, it says an immoral woman

1242
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,780
 whose heart was hardened and her life was defined by sin.

1243
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,260
 But she was bankrupt.

1244
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,540
 And she was mourning.

1245
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,420
 And she wanted a new master,

1246
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,720
 not the men that rode her all around town,

1247
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,780
 but she wanted somebody that was tender towards her.

1248
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,020
 And she heard about this guy who loves women like her.

1249
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,700
 And she came in weeping.

1250
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,620
 And this is Jesus.

1251
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,440
 Can you imagine that?

1252
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,060
 He's carrying on a conversation

1253
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,580
 while some woman is kissing his feet

1254
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,940
 and wetting his feet with tears.

1255
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,380
 He's going, "Hey, Simon, let me ask you a question."

1256
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,100
 I mean, this is funny to me, okay?

1257
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
 In one sense, tragic, but I don't know how,

1258
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,820
 you know, it would have tickled or something.

1259
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,660
 (laughing)

1260
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,380
 Simon, I can't stop laughing.

1261
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,220
 Right?

1262
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,060
 But no, I mean, it's a tender moment.

1263
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,020
 What is going on right here, it says,

1264
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,040
 he looks at Simon, he said,

1265
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,460
 "Hey, man, Simon, let me ask you a question, bro."

1266
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,580
 'Cause Simon was looking at him and going,

1267
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,700
 "You're no prophet.

1268
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,100
 "If you were a prophet, you'd know who that was

1269
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,420
 "at your feet."

1270
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,760
 He goes, "Well, you're right, I'm more than a prophet.

1271
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,900
 "I'm God.

1272
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,320
 "And this is how I feel towards sinners

1273
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,760
 "when they are poor in spirit and mourning

1274
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,440
 "and looking for a new master

1275
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,740
 "that won't ride 'em for some tithe, Pharisee,

1276
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,180
 "or some pleasure, heathen."

1277
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,260
 He said, "Let me ask you a question.

1278
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,940
 "When I came in, did you even wash my feet?

1279
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,060
 "Did you even have any one of your servants

1280
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,900
 "tend to my feet?

1281
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,400
 "No, but this woman, she came in here with her tears

1282
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,020
 "and with her life savings, and she broke it over me.

1283
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,040
 "Let me ask you a question.

1284
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,100
 "If one guy owed 500 days wages to a guy,

1285
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,940
 "another guy owed 50 days wages to a guy,

1286
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,920
 "and he was forgiven both of those people,

1287
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,720
 "which one of those two would appreciate him more?"

1288
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,000
 He goes, "Well, I guess the guy with 500."

1289
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,860
 He goes, "Way to go, Einstein, Pharisee.

1290
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,120
 "Nice job, well done.

1291
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,280
 "It's that one.

1292
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,400
 "She knows how much she's been forgiven.

1293
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,600
 "But here's the thing, you're in debt to me, too.

1294
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,000
 "But you just keep comparing yourself to Manson.

1295
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,520
 "But bro, you owe me everything.

1296
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,080
 "I'm gonna throw your little tail into sinner's prison

1297
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,480
 "unless you start to figure out the reason she's like that

1298
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,020
 "is she's been forgiven much, and so she loves me much.

1299
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,500
 "You haven't been forgiven a lick.

1300
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,100
 "That's why I couldn't even get a bowl of water from you.

1301
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,540
 "You better lower your head, beat your chest,

1302
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,740
 "and cry for mercy."

1303
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,540
 See that?

1304
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,780
 This is what people that are saved like,

1305
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,820
 are you a merciful person?

1306
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,060
 Are you like some people, I'll never forgive you.

1307
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,980
 I'm like, oh, oh, don't say that.

1308
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:51,740
 Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount a little bit later,

1309
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,280
 is gonna have you come across this little amazing thing

1310
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,220
 called the Lord's Prayer.

1311
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,940
 He teaches you how to pray in this little message.

1312
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,340
 And in that message, he's gonna say,

1313
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,040
 "Father, teach us to forgive our trespasses

1314
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,220
 "as we forgive those who trespass against us."

1315
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,780
 In other words, if you're not forgiving other people,

1316
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,280
 he goes, "I'll forgive you the way you don't forgive people.

1317
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,120
 "I won't forgive you."

1318
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:09,940
 Why?

1319
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,340
 Because I want you to be like me.

1320
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:17,860
 And I want me to help you love like I love.

1321
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,960
 Thunder Hoof, you gonna let me, Thunder Hoof, shepherd you?

1322
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,820
 This is what they look like, man.

1323
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,140
 They hunger and thirst for righteousness,

1324
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,540
 they're merciful, and they're pure in heart,

1325
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,460
 for they shall see God.

1326
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,560
 Look at what this means.

1327
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,940
 You wanna see life, okay?

1328
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,380
 It doesn't mean they're sinless.

1329
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,220
 It means that their heart is directed more and more

1330
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,500
 towards righteousness.

1331
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,220
 And what is happening here is they're not being conformed

1332
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,320
 to the world, but their heart is now being directed

1333
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,860
 towards God because the Holy Spirit lives in you.

1334
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,860
 All right, that's what happens when all of a sudden

1335
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,160
 you start to see God correctly.

1336
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,520
 That is a work of the Spirit.

1337
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,840
 So you see God for who he is.

1338
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,140
 The Spirit exalts God, the Spirit celebrates God,

1339
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,700
 the Spirit is God, the Spirit wants you to know more of God.

1340
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,840
 And so your heart will begin to follow him.

1341
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,220
 And if you're not following him,

1342
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,460
 it's because you're not born in spirit,

1343
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,820
 you haven't mourned over your sin,

1344
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,260
 and you're not asking God to lead you.

1345
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,860
 Because if God is lead, if you're saved on those conditions,

1346
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,240
 then you will be somebody who is merciful.

1347
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,420
 You will hunger and thirst for more of this God

1348
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,500
 that you know is good.

1349
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,660
 And you will have your heart consistently be pure.

1350
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,060
 And this is the deal, listen to this.

1351
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,500
 You won't be conformed to the world,

1352
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,100
 but you'll be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

1353
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,800
 And then you will, it says in Romans 12 too,

1354
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,080
 it says, and then you will prove the will of God.

1355
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:35,780
 In other words, it doesn't mean that your life

1356
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,560
 is going to become this glorious thing.

1357
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,160
 It means that you will prove out that the will of God

1358
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,320
 is good and acceptable and perfect.

1359
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,420
 It's what Thunderhoof experienced.

1360
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:50,340
 And he goes, hey man, you know what?

1361
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,040
 With that cowboy, the cowboy, the king and creator

1362
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,840
 of the world, that was the good life.

1363
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,960
 And you're gonna experience that.

1364
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,040
 And the more you seek God, the more you're going

1365
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,000
 to experience what God is.

1366
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,200
 That's Romans 12 too.

1367
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,880
 Not conformed to the world, but being transformed

1368
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,680
 by the renewing of your mind, because your mind listens

1369
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,360
 to the spirit, so that you can experience in your own life,

1370
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,980
 prove out that God's way is good, it's acceptable,

1371
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,820
 it's perfect.

1372
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,960
 That's why you see those of us who have come

1373
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,800
 to know Christ here, saying come and see, man.

1374
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,000
 Come to the porch, I want you to meet Jesus.

1375
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,420
 Because we're saying, it's so much better

1376
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,960
 than what you think you're finding out there

1377
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,040
 in the open range.

1378
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,720
 Quickly, not only do we have who is saved,

1379
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,980
 not only do we know what they look like,

1380
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,560
 but this is what they do, they are peacemakers.

1381
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,120
 Why, because you're a son of God, and what is God?

1382
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,560
 God is a peacemaker.

1383
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,300
 He came in order to reconcile you to God,

1384
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,920
 and so if you are related to God, if you are a person

1385
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,360
 that really knows the goodness of God,

1386
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,600
 you are gonna be telling other people,

1387
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,040
 let me tell you about God, man.

1388
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,400
 He's not looking for you to build a resume.

1389
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,240
 He has built a cross, and he hung himself on it,

1390
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,600
 that you might be saved.

1391
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,320
 Let me make peace with you and God,

1392
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,840
 by telling you about the gospel of peace.

1393
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:06,040
 That's what people who are related to God do,

1394
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,580
 and you're very happy, because all of a sudden,

1395
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,360
 your life matters, and it's not about the next car,

1396
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,280
 or the next girlfriend, or the next sexual experience,

1397
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,080
 or the next big football game.

1398
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,220
 It's about changing somebody's forever.

1399
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,680
 And you go, man, this is the good life.

1400
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:29,060
 And I can't imagine anything else like it.

1401
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,060
 And I'm a peacemaker.

1402
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,160
 Let me ask you a question, gang.

1403
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,800
 How are your relationships defined?

1404
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,200
 If your relationships are not defined by peace,

1405
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,040
 in other words, if you leave a wreckage of sin,

1406
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,980
 separation, anxiety, and hate, and insecurity,

1407
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,440
 if you are not into low-impact dating,

1408
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,080
 where your trash and your footprints

1409
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,280
 are where they shouldn't be,

1410
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,980
 and your handprints are where it shouldn't be,

1411
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,820
 whew,

1412
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,080
 now watch this, you're not saved,

1413
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,840
 because you don't screw up somebody's campground,

1414
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,200
 you don't screw up somebody's campground,

1415
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,260
 because you're saved.

1416
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,920
 And if every relationship you've got,

1417
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,640
 or the ones you get into, are not defined by peace,

1418
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,100
 man, that should concern you.

1419
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:14,700
 It's what they do, man, they're peacemakers.

1420
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,240
 And listen, this is what they should endure.

1421
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,720
 They're gonna endure some persecution

1422
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,840
 for the sake of righteousness.

1423
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,280
 Now notice this, you're gonna be persecuted

1424
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,680
 for Jesus' sake, not because you're an idiot,

1425
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,960
 not because you're a sister birthed or better than you,

1426
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,200
 not because you walk around and go,

1427
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,440
 well, that's a bad sin, I never did that sin.

1428
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,880
 Okay, those kind of people are self-righteous.

1429
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,560
 But listen, if you call good good in today's day and age,

1430
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,480
 and if you call evil evil in today's day and age,

1431
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,400
 the world's gonna hate you.

1432
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,120
 You're gonna be a minority people in a majority world

1433
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,160
 that loves darkness and hates the light.

1434
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,000
 But if you start to say, no, I'm not gonna fudge

1435
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,040
 on who the cowboy is that can ride and roll your life,

1436
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,100
 the cowboy is Christ, and the cowboy is loving,

1437
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:02,140
 and his standard is true, and his words are infallible

1438
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,440
 and inerrant, and they should illumine your heart,

1439
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,840
 they're gonna say, don't you dare tell me that.

1440
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,720
 I'm gonna tell you that my God says it's okay,

1441
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,200
 and I'm gonna tell them that the God

1442
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,240
 that you say you worship is not a holy God,

1443
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,760
 because he doesn't contradict himself.

1444
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,920
 And they're gonna say, you intolerant bigot.

1445
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,760
 You don't know me, and you don't know right,

1446
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,640
 and they're gonna hate you.

1447
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,520
 Can I just tell you something, man?

1448
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,080
 Truth sounds like hate to those who hate the truth.

1449
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:28,320
 And Jesus says, if they hate you, don't be surprised.

1450
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,280
 Man, they hated me.

1451
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,480
 You're just my disciple, and you just keep loving them.

1452
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,320
 He's gonna tell you in this little story

1453
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,740
 how to relate to the world.

1454
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,140
 And he's gonna say, love them.

1455
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:43,280
 And when reviled, don't revile in return, man.

1456
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,960
 Don't be Westboro Baptist.

1457
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,840
 The world rightly hates them.

1458
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,040
 They're not hating Jesus when they hate them.

1459
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,520
 But you love people with truth.

1460
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,320
 This is what else you should expect.

1461
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,920
 You should expect that people will insult you

1462
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,960
 and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil

1463
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,160
 against you because of Jesus.

1464
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,640
 But rejoice and be glad, 'cause he's gonna make

1465
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,600
 this personal right now for you.

1466
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,560
 You will experience reward that is great.

1467
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,040
 Because they didn't put me down and keep me down,

1468
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,240
 but I was resurrected to life,

1469
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,400
 and you will follow me in that.

1470
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,760
 And I am who I said I was,

1471
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,300
 and all who know me will follow me.

1472
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,240
 Hey, guys, can I just tell you something, man?

1473
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,800
 I mean, listen, I got nothing to gain.

1474
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,040
 I'm not selling anything.

1475
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,800
 Except I'm gonna tell you, my room was dark,

1476
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,680
 and God kicked it in.

1477
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,240
 The light came flushing in, and I wanted to be embarrassed

1478
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,640
 and hide in guilt and shame, but I listened to him,

1479
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,180
 and what he said is, hey, Todd,

1480
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,380
 I wanna make you the man I designed you to be.

1481
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,260
 Come here, come here, come here.

1482
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,780
 Hey, Thunderhoof, come here.

1483
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,020
 Hey, Stud, hey, Stallion, shh, shh.

1484
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,180
 I mean, you wanna throw down,

1485
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,500
 I'm gonna throw down eventually.

1486
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,540
 But for now, I'm gonna just, I'm gonna welcome you out.

1487
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,380
 I'm gonna woo you out.

1488
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,260
 I'm gonna be a sin whisperer.

1489
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,100
 Come here, shh.

1490
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,760
 There's life out here.

1491
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,940
 About the time I was your age, I started following Jesus.

1492
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,700
 Today, I got an email from a little girl

1493
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,980
 who has been raised in my home.

1494
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,840
 She happens to be 4,000 miles away from me.

1495
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,300
 She said, Dad, pray for me, I'm having a hard day.

1496
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,340
 And then she wrote me this note in the middle

1497
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,320
 of her hard day.

1498
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,860
 Dad, it's day 10 here in Spain.

1499
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,500
 Time's moving fast and really slow all at the same time.

1500
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,660
 There are moments when I can't believe

1501
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,060
 I've been here this long, and then moments

1502
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,580
 where I can't believe that I only have been here

1503
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:41,300
 for 10 days, I miss you a lot, more than I thought I would.

1504
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,900
 Probably because I know I live with a family

1505
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,500
 that is really different from ours.

1506
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,580
 In other words, she's living now

1507
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,740
 in an immersion Spanish program over in Spain.

1508
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,980
 She goes, the family I'm living with over here

1509
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,080
 is not like my family.

1510
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,300
 It has made me so thankful for the countless blessings

1511
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,700
 that God has given our family.

1512
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,900
 It's made me want to fight for my relationships

1513
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,020
 with you and Mom and my five brothers and sisters even more.

1514
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,260
 Mom and Dad, thank you for the way

1515
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,740
 that you have chosen to love God, each other and us.

1516
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,260
 I am so thankful for your investment and your shepherding.

1517
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,100
 Thank you for introducing us to Christ,

1518
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,040
 for modeling how to be strong and obedient men

1519
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,880
 and women of faith.

1520
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,140
 I cannot imagine how different my life would be without you,

1521
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,200
 and especially without the Lord.

1522
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,780
 I have met so many kids and so many friends

1523
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,400
 who are over here in the same experience that I'm in,

1524
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,640
 with all kinds of backgrounds,

1525
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,020
 none of them really loving, none of them coming

1526
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,740
 from a family like ours, or a relationship with the God

1527
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,900
 that you have shown me.

1528
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,700
 I am so blessed to know Jesus.

1529
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,300
 There are a lot of hurting people out there, Dad,

1530
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,540
 and I'm so thankful to God for how he's chosen each of us

1531
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,540
 and given us life.

1532
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,620
 God is so good.

1533
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,780
 It's very humbling to remember that I had nothing to do

1534
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:40,220
 with being born in this family,

1535
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,820
 and to be given the many gifts that I have,

1536
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,020
 a few things that I'm thankful for today.

1537
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,840
 We love each other unconditionally.

1538
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,340
 We love to spend time together.

1539
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,620
 We cherish family time.

1540
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,620
 We communicate, we know each other.

1541
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,300
 We care about each other's lives.

1542
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,220
 We support and invest in each other.

1543
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,380
 I love that you guys know me as well as my friends do,

1544
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,620
 that you all love me and you consider me your friend.

1545
01:00:58,620 --> 01:00:59,680
 We encourage each other.

1546
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,100
 We seek to make each other better.

1547
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:01,940
 We serve each other.

1548
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,740
 We have fun together.

1549
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,160
 I know that we struggle sometimes,

1550
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,140
 but we have it so good, better than we know.

1551
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,940
 I am praying that we take more advantage

1552
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:12,240
 of the incredible blessing with which we have been given.

1553
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,020
 God has been so good to us.

1554
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:18,100
 Hey, Macarena.

1555
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,440
 I mean, that's the letter I got today.

1556
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,460
 Can I tell you something?

1557
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:26,860
 I wanted to cheat on her, Mom.

1558
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:31,660
 Can I tell you something?

1559
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,160
 I wanted to be abusive to my kids and exasperate them

1560
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,060
 and tell them to shut up.

1561
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,460
 I wanted to live my own way.

1562
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,740
 I wanted to give my heart away to porn.

1563
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,740
 I wanted to numb myself.

1564
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,740
 That's who I wanted to be.

1565
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,400
 That's who I still want to be,

1566
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,380
 except I have listened to the God whisperers.

1567
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,640
 Todd, you can go that way if you want, bro.

1568
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,900
 You can have all the riotous weekends you want in Vegas, man.

1569
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,260
 You can make that your destiny,

1570
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,960
 or you can just follow me and I'm gonna saddle you up.

1571
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,460
 And here's the deal, Todd.

1572
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,620
 Todd, listen to me.

1573
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,620
 If you ride with me, man, this is your legacy.

1574
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,100
 This is the way that kings, glorious men live.

1575
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,860
 Their little girls say that.

1576
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:11,920
 So I've never had an affair.

1577
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,360
 I've never given myself away to wanton pleasures.

1578
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,700
 I've lived my life the way that my Savior told me to live.

1579
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,820
 And can I tell you something?

1580
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,540
 I'm 30 years ahead of you.

1581
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,220
 This is the good life, baby.

1582
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,620
 And when Jesus showed up and said,

1583
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,900
 psst, hey, man, you want to be blessed?

1584
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,140
 Let's go.

1585
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,220
 I'm not rich.

1586
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,380
 I'm richer than most.

1587
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,620
 I'm richer than I should be.

1588
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,160
 But man, I am rich.

1589
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,980
 God is good.

1590
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:41,460
 And he's gonna tell you about the good life

1591
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,960
 these next 10 weeks, amen?

1592
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,500
 If you don't know him, would you just go,

1593
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,380
 bro, I tell you, you don't know how dark my room is.

1594
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,500
 I don't care how dark your room is.

1595
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,460
 The door's gonna open up.

1596
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,600
 He's inviting you to come out of the darkness

1597
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,460
 into his marvelous light.

1598
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,140
 And I'm here to tell you, man, it's marvelous.

1599
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,160
 Temptation is still very real to me.

1600
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,860
 I watch lots of stallions my age

1601
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,280
 still riotously living, and I wonder.

1602
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,060
 And then I get letters like that, and I don't wonder at all.

1603
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,940
 Men hate me because I stand for righteousness.

1604
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,660
 I'm not included in certain parties and weekends

1605
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,100
 and invitations, just like Jesus.

1606
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,980
 And I am blessed.

1607
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:22,500
 Let me pray with you.

1608
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,860
 (congregation applauding)

1609
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,540
 Father, I pray that my friends in this room

1610
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,900
 would listen to the words of Jesus

1611
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,860
 and that somehow my words have illumined them for them,

1612
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:31,820
 that what you're saying is, hey, man,

1613
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:32,640
 you wanna be happy?

1614
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,660
 Come here.

1615
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:34,620
 I'm the God of happiness.

1616
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,180
 I'm the God of the blessed way.

1617
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:41,180
 Father, that you went the way of the curse.

1618
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:45,220
 You went and hung on a tree that you would make your son,

1619
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,580
 who knew no sin, to become sin on my behalf,

1620
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,940
 that I might become the righteousness of God in him,

1621
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,740
 and so that guilt and shame wouldn't defy me,

1622
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,000
 that the wages of my sin wouldn't lead to death,

1623
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,580
 but the wages of your righteousness for my sin

1624
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,420
 would lead me to life.

1625
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,140
 And I pray that this morning, this afternoon, this evening,

1626
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,260
 there'd be somebody in this room tonight,

1627
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,460
 in Fort Worth tonight,

1628
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,020
 somebody listening by podcast tonight

1629
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,460
 that would decide that they're sick and tired

1630
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:10,660
 of being sick and tired.

1631
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:13,180
 And they would hear that you're kicking in

1632
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:14,340
 the room of their heart tonight

1633
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:15,640
 and you're coming in with light and love.

1634
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,220
 There's gonna be a day you're gonna kick it in

1635
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,540
 and you're gonna come to make, you know,

1636
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:22,680
 SEAL Team Six look like a bunch of kindergartners,

1637
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,980
 but today's the day of salvation.

1638
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,780
 And you woo 'em out through the door that is Jesus Christ.

1639
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:31,420
 And I pray that they would listen to me as I testify

1640
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,820
 that his is the blessed way.

1641
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,180
 That they would believe that the blessed man

1642
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,780
 does not walk in the counsel of the wicked

1643
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,940
 or stand in the path of sinners

1644
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,060
 or sit in the seat of scoffers,

1645
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,420
 but his delight is in the law of the Lord

1646
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,220
 and on that law he meditates day and night.

1647
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,820
 Father, would you bring your children,

1648
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:50,300
 would you let those that are of your fold hear your voice?

1649
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,820
 May they look at you tonight and say,

1650
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,900
 "Hey, Jesus, saddle up.

1651
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:58,780
 "Ride me in all your glory and grace and strength.

1652
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,780
 "Make me whole."

1653
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:03,460
 Father, I pray for those of us that have already trusted you

1654
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,780
 as the cowboy king, that we would be more eager,

1655
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,060
 hunger more, thirst more for you to lead us than ever

1656
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,060
 because we have been reminded tonight that your way is good.

1657
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:18,900
 Remind us now through song that your way is good

1658
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,340
 and your word is true.

1659
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,840
 The word is true.
