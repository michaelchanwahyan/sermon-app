1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Good evening and welcome to the porch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of relationships.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Can we cue some music please?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 From our friendships to our romantic endeavors, we'll explore our family bonds,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 estranged relationships, work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 So how do we relate?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 This is, after all, the Relationship Series.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Alright, Porch, how we doing? We doing okay?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Great to see ya. Welcome back to the Relationship Series.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 So glad that you would choose to be with us.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Not just those of you that are here in the room, but especially those of you that are here online with us.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 A special shout out to Porch Live Dayton, Porch Live Indianapolis, and Porch Live Scottsdale.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We're so grateful that y'all will be a part of what's happening here at the porch.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I've got some very special friends with me here tonight.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And we've got a very special evening prepared for you.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 But first what I want to do is I want to introduce my friends here to my left.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 This is Kaitlyn Van Wagner and this is John Cox.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Everybody say hello.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Yeah. Okay.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So here's what we're doing tonight.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 We are continuing in our series, the Relationship Series, where we're talking about God's design for connecting to one another.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And what we did a couple of weeks ago is we basically walked through a theology of work.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Which is important because if you consider the average adult life, roughly a third of your life is going to be committed to the office space.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I don't know if you know that.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I did the math.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And it's going to be roughly 30% of your life.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Your waking hours are going to be spent on the job.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And so knowing that that's the truth, we thought we would bring in some very special authorities on the topic of work.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Here's what would be helpful before we just get things rolling.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Kaitlyn, John, would you all just do a quick introduction of yourself, what your role is here at Watermark, and a brief bio on your work experience.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Awesome.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Hey, y'all.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 My name is Kaitlyn Van Wagner.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I get to serve as the Senior Director of Communications here at Watermark.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Before I took a hard left turn into ministry, I was in the corporate world.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 So I was a branding strategist at an ad agency here in Dallas for several years before I came to work here at Watermark.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And I'm John Cox, and I'm the Executive Pastor here at Watermark.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And I have spent about half my life in ministry and about half in business.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And so Stanford undergrad, did ministry for a while, went back and got an MBA from Harvard, moved to Dallas.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Did you hear that?

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Oh, no. Yeah.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 He was like, should I share that?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Hold on, hold on, hold on.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I went to Texas A&M.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 [CHEERS]

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 See, Aggies get the whoop.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yeah, much better.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 You get the--

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Much better.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Yeah, we're fear of the tree.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 That's what this--

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Stanford is.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So after I got my MBA, I moved to Dallas.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And so I had grown up as a Navy kid, never lived in the middle of the US, but moved to Dallas,

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 went to work for a strategy consulting company called the Boston Consulting Group.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Worked for them for about five years, then went to a hedge fund in town,

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 which they had a strategy just for HBK Investments, and did that for about five years before I came on staff.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And so been on staff for about the last 14 years, minus a three-year break back in investments.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 That's awesome.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Listen, I don't know what your work situation is, but we got you covered here tonight.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I hope you brought a big pad, because you're going to want to take some notes.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 They were unpacking for me very briefly some of the things that they were wanting to share this evening,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and I was like, where's my journal?

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Like, I need to take some of this down for myself, because they truly have an experience that's going to be really beneficial to you.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Here's why we're doing this.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We know that work is a big part of your life.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But we also know that the truth of God's word is not just meant to be intellectualized.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's meant to be practically executed.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 You're supposed to take the knowledge in your mind, and you're supposed to live it into existence.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And so we wanted to give you some really good handles to hold as you consider your work experience,

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 as you consider what your professional endeavors are today, tomorrow, and then into the future.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And so we polled the porch public, and we asked you guys, hey, what are your questions?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And so we've taken those, and we've synthesized them, and we've prepared some questions for John and Caitlin to walk us through.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The first one I think is really appropriate, because so much of the topic around professionalism is connected to purpose.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 A lot of people look to their job, and they want to find purpose or fulfillment within it.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 They want to do that.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 They want to find whatever it is their passion, and they want to pursue that in their career.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And so the first thing that I want to ask you guys is just how can we be faithful in our jobs when it doesn't feel purposeful,

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 or we're not necessarily passionate about it?

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 What would you all say?

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Absolutely.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I would say the first thing I would say is faithfulness isn't dependent on your circumstances,

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 including what job you have or how passionate you are about that job.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I think obviously there is a desire to be passionate.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 That's an ideal we want to ascribe to, but that's not always the case.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 In fact, there is a lot to be said about working at a job that you might not necessarily be passionate about.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 You can learn a lot from being placed in a job that you might not be as well suited for or maybe not passionate about.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 You can learn what you're not good at.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 There is a lot to be learned, and really smart people know how to redeem every single experience in their life

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 for essentially creating a greater work acumen, a greater work resume.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So you don't necessarily have to be working in your -- especially right out of college.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 I think there's a myth that you'll find your dream job, and until I find my dream job, I'm going to keep job hopping.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 There can be a lot to be said by staying and being faithful where you have been placed to make an impact wherever you're at.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 That is a news flash.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 I worked in college ministry for a long time, and then I jumped into young adult ministry shortly thereafter, and it's true.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Some of you would nod your heads in agreement that your hope coming out of your undergraduate degree or grad school

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 was to find that thing that I'm burning up with unbridled passion for, and let me leverage all of my life to it.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And that's just not the way it goes.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I think Kaitlin is speaking to something really important.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I also think if you're expecting your job to fulfill your purpose, you're expecting your job to fill a role it was never meant to do,

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 which it cannot fulfill.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Only Christ can give you your purpose.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So if you are waiting for your job to feel filled with purpose, you're going to be waiting forever because it just isn't going to happen.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Your purpose should come from Christ, and don't put your job in a position to fill a role it's not ever going to fill.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Yeah.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Yeah, I think one other thing is, you know, when you think about jobs, you think about where you're going to work,

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and then you think about how you're going to work, right?

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And the Lord is much more concerned with how you work than where you work.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so lots of people get wrapped around the axle, "Am I in the right place?"

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And the question you should be asking is, "Hey, how am I doing my job?

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Am I doing it with faithfulness?"

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 You know, in the book of Colossians, it just says, "Whatever you do, work it out with all your heart.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It's working for the Lord, not for men, because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 It is the Lord Christ you're serving."

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And he's much more concerned with how we're working in the job that we're in.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And any job is not perfect, right?

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And so at Watermark, I often say to myself, "Hey, when the days are really hard, I'm getting paid double.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Those days I'm getting paid double.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And the days that are easy, I'm working for free."

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And it generally balances out, you know?

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So that's just what I'm telling myself.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I'm working--I'm getting paid double today.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 That's really good.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Some of you needed to hear that.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 You're like, "I'm getting paid double for this one."

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yeah, you know, I think the both of you just alluded to something that I think is really important.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And we've actually--we've said this from the stage before, but I know this is probably true for you all.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 I know as I've visited with young adults, often what I hear is, "Man, I'm just--I'm not getting life from my job."

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But here's the newsflash.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Your job was never meant to give you life.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Like, it was never intended to accomplish that end.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 No, it is a part of what God has called you to do here in this world as you walk with him.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But the only one that gives life is Jesus Christ.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 In him is life and life to the full.

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 That's where you'll find it.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And so I think it's really important that that's known here from the outset.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 One thing that I was looking at, which I thought this was fascinating.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I don't know what you all think about this.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Recently, Gallup, they did a study, and it showed that 30% of Americans are disengaged.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Excuse me, only 30% of Americans are actively engaged on the job.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Which would mean that 70% are somewhere underneath active engagement, trending towards disengagement.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 This is the lowest level of engagement recorded in the last decade.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Which is fascinating when you consider that many of us are pursuing jobs according to our passions.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 It means that your passion is actually not leading to fulfillment.

146
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It means that you're pursuing that which is going to make me feel amazing in life.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Like, I'm going to choose the job I love, and I'll never work a day in my life.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And yet what's happened is you're actively disengaged, though you have pursued your passions.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And it's because that's not meant to give you life.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 It's not meant to engage you.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 I thought this was also very interesting, and I'll just have you all speak to it.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Because I'm curious.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 The main reasons why people are disengaged on the job are -- the main three categories were remote employees,

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 those that are in hybrid work situations, and young adults under 35.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 So, John, you and I were talking about this earlier.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Because there's a lot that's heaped up in this idea of, like, I'm supposed to pursue my passion.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And yet we were talking about, well, there's a difference between pursuing a job according to my passion

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and pursuing a job according to my gifts.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Would you mind speaking to that?

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Yeah, so I think any time you're looking at a job, you're looking at four factors.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 The first one is, where do I want to work, like, geographically?

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Where do I want to live?

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 The second one is a specific industry.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Are you passionate about oil and gas or consumer retail or medicine?

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And the third one is really, what are you doing every day?

166
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Like, when you show up at 8 o'clock, what are the tasks you're doing?

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And do they fit with how God has wired you?

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And then the last one is the culture.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Like, do I like the people I work with?

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And what I see consistently is the younger you are, the more likely you are to emphasize,

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 where do I want to live and what industry would I want to work in?

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And the truth is, is what most impacts your satisfaction on your job is,

173
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 what am I doing every day?

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And am I good at those things?

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And then correspondingly, am I working with people that I genuinely enjoy being around?

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And so, you know, the thing about me is that I never had a 40-year vision for what I was supposed to do.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Like, one of the greatest lies is that if I only find the right job,

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 then everything is going to fall into place.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And what I would say is, is if you asked me ever since I was 21 years old

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 where I was going to be in five years, okay, I would now be wrong 39 consecutive years, right?

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Predicting where you're going to be or finding the perfect job is just an illusion.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And so, what I've learned is, is hey, when you're in a job, right,

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 what you want to do is get into a spot where you're using the things that God has gifted you to do

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 and surround yourself with people that you genuinely like seeing, right?

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Like, that's important.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And then you've got to understand that life is difficult, okay?

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Because if you don't understand life is difficult, what happens is the first time you have a setback

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 or there's some dissatisfaction with a job, okay, you begin to think something's wrong.

189
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And if on the other hand, you just go, hey, life is difficult, right, that's normal, okay?

190
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Then you don't get unsettled when, you know, when things aren't working out exactly the way you want them to.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 - I think that's such a--we've talked about this before, John.

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 There's freedom in--I'm the same way. I've never had a five-year plan for my life.

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I've always just gone, hey, what's God have for me in the next season of my life?

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And there's a lot of freedom in that.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 You don't have to put pressure on yourself to know where you're going to be in five years

196
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 to make all these things line up to make sure you're knocking them down in a row.

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And so, it's like you can take a minute to breathe.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I think some people do get calls on their life and they have a vision of like, you know,

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I'm not going to be--I know I'm not going to be a doctor in five years.

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 That's for sure. I know I'm not going to be--but some people have that.

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 But like you can also give yourself some room to exhale to go, what would God have for me?

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And I want to be faithful with what opportunities he's bringing me today for this next season.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 - Okay. So, y'all both alluded to I want to excel at what's revealed.

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Like where God has me today is where God wants me today.

205
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 It matters less what I do and it matters more how I do it.

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 People are really familiar with the idea of someone being called to ministry.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Is it possible to be called to a career, to a specific job?

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And how do you make sense of that? What would y'all say to that?

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 - Yeah, I think I would say, does that happen? Yes. Okay.

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But I think a much more likely path is that it is a process of investigation.

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And I think really in your 20s, one of your main goals is to try and figure out,

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 what am I good at and how can I deploy that? Right?

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Because I think that when you think about work, you're thinking about,

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 you want to go to a place where you add value. Okay?

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 That's much easier to do if you are naturally good at it.

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Second, you want to go to a place where you can impact people.

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Because at the end of the day, it's all about relationships. Okay?

218
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And then the third thing that you want to do as you're thinking about that kind of stuff

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 is how am I developing my gifts today so that I can be even more valuable tomorrow?

220
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Right? What am I doing to develop myself?

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And so that's how I think about if I'm doing those three things,

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 then I'm moving in the right direction.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I tell people all the time, your 20s are for learning.

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Everybody's expecting to arrive in their 20s.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And it's just not the way it works.

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I talk to so many young adults right out of college

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 who genuinely just don't know what they're good at.

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And that's okay. That's an okay place to be,

229
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 to not know exactly what your gift sets are.

230
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 There's tons of assessments you can take to help you figure that out.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 But honestly, that's why it can be useful doing jobs that you don't like

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 because you learn that you are not good at things.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And that's just as valuable. Right?

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So also give yourself a little bit of grace.

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 If you don't quite know what you're good at,

236
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 just keep going and trying and asking for different types of projects

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 on the work that you're on.

238
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Hey, try to flex some new muscles.

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 You fail at it, we maybe go in a different direction. Right?

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So give yourself a little bit of grace.

241
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So how do we learn what we're good at?

242
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 How do we discern what our God-given gifting is?

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I think about it in two categories.

244
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I think about drains and gains.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So what are some of the tasks that when I'm doing them,

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 they give me energy.

247
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Like, I love, if you hang around me,

248
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 my favorite place in the entire world to be is at a whiteboard.

249
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Like, it is my comfort animal, is a whiteboard.

250
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And I love any task. And it gives me energy.

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I get like a weird little buzz when I'm whiteboarding or problem solving

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 or that sort of thing.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And it's like, if you put me in front of an Excel document, my soul dies.

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And so, and like, but that's taking--

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 So you're like, amen.

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Yes, the lights go out.

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Preach.

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And but I think just having a sense for what is giving you naturally energy

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 when you're doing those tasks and what seems to be draining energy from you.

260
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Sometimes you still have to do those tasks.

261
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Because sometimes being faithful means I still have to do Excel.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I still have to do my budget every single year.

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And so you have to do some of those.

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 But where are you naturally gaining energy and getting energy drained from you?

265
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And then honestly, ask people around you.

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Like, your parents probably have a good sense,

267
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 might have a good sense of what you're good at and what you're not good at.

268
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Ask trusted people around you.

269
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Where do I seem to excel?

270
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Where do I seem to not seem to naturally be a skilled?

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Yeah, yeah, I think feedback is great.

272
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Because sometimes it's hard to see in yourself.

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And so what I would say is it's not always obvious.

274
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 So you've got to try a lot of things. Right?

275
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And it's practice where you begin to find that groove.

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And you just need to be patient with yourself.

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 If you don't know, that's okay. Right?

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I was 35 years old before I began to figure out what I was really good at.

279
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 I think that there's two things that I always point people towards.

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 John, you just took one. And Kaitlyn, you took the other.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 We didn't even plan it.

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But I'll put it in alliteration for you.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Feedback from others and its fruitfulness in my labor.

284
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 That's how you discern if I'm gifted.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 From the Lord for a specific task.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 You see the Apostle Paul, when he's appointing Timothy to the work of pastoring the church at Ephesus,

287
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 they lay hands upon Timothy.

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 They affirm him that he is gifted for the work of pastoring there.

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 There's feedback. Good feedback that you're gifted for this.

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 We've all watched American Idol.

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And we've seen people betrayed by a lack of honest feedback.

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 That's not your gifting.

293
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Don't go on the show. Don't sing in front of those judges.

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Some of you need some honest feedback in your life.

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You need people to help you learn what am I actually gifted and good for.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And you also need to discern where's the fruit in my life.

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Like if God's given me a gift for it,

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 then the nature of God is that the things that he applies his hands to, they burst in life.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And so as you apply your hands through God's gifted provision,

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 they'll burst forth in life as well.

301
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And he will do so for his glory and for the good of other people.

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Now, let's turn a corner because y'all have both kind of spoken to this,

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 which I think is important.

304
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 How do we know when it's time to search for another job?

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Because I think there's something good that y'all have pushed on,

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 and it may be worth pushing a little bit more.

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Like hey, just because it's hard doesn't mean you get out.

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And so I want us to speak to that.

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 But at the same time, we do need to be discerning of when it's time to move

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 and transition into a new job or a new career or something along those lines.

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 So what would y'all say to that?

312
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I think I could speak to the pushing through.

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I think for me, impact has often come to me through longevity.

314
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And so when somebody comes onto my team, and it was the same for me in the marketplace

315
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 as it was in ministry, I say the same -- we give them the same speech on day one.

316
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 You are not going to know how to do your job for a solid year.

317
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It takes a solid year to understand how to do a job.

318
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 For me, my pattern has been in both places.

319
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 It takes a year for me to learn how to do a job.

320
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 It takes another year for me to get semi-good at it.

321
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And then the third year is where it gets really fun,

322
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 because I've built up the relational and professional equity

323
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 where I can start to make an impact on the organization.

324
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 So there is something to be said for longevity.

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 When I worked in advertising, it was pretty known that the quickest way to get a pay bump

326
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 was you jumped agencies every 18 months.

327
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And that could make sense, and there are times when you would want to job hop like that

328
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 if you have bad workplaces or things like that.

329
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 But man, it got really good at like year three,

330
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 and that's when I started to make an impact and see --

331
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and that's when I started to find even more purpose in my work,

332
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 because I was seeing the fruit of that.

333
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So there is something to be said for longevity.

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Yeah, and I think about it a lot like I think about dating.

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 So taking a job is not like getting married.

336
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 You are not stuck there for the rest of your life.

337
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 On the other hand, taking a job is not like a first date.

338
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So somewhere between I'm going to switch jobs every three months

339
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 and I'm never switching jobs is probably the right path.

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So I've been in six different companies over the course of my career.

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And one of the things is there are lots of times I've been in jobs where I'm frustrated

342
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 or where I feel like it's painful in certain parts of my job.

343
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And as a general rule for me, right, when I'm thinking about taking another job,

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 what I want to do is you don't want to move away from things.

345
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 You want to move toward things, right?

346
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 So if you're in a job that is frustrating, right,

347
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 the wrong thing to do is leave a job because it's frustrating.

348
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 The right thing to do is to begin to get your antenna up,

349
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 see if the frustration is lasting, and think about what can I move toward.

350
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Right, so you move toward things, not away from things.

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And so what have I learned here?

352
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And now knowing that, what do I want to move towards next?

353
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 What about if it's a toxic or abusive work environment?

354
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Well, then you start to think about you're starting to pay a cost, right?

355
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And so I think that's where, especially as Christ followers,

356
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 your faith becomes really important for how you work through that level of conflict

357
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 in order to, if you're going to leave, something like that,

358
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 my charge to you would be like, how can you leave well?

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 How can you leave honestly?

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 How can you leave with your integrity intact, not having gossiped

361
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 or burned the place down on your way out, right?

362
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So what does that look like?

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So I do think that that could be a reason to leave.

364
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 My charge to you in that would be, how do you leave well?

365
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 That's really good, yeah.

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I think that toxic work environment is thrown around a lot in our generation.

367
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And what we need to do is we need to qualify what we mean by toxic.

368
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Just because it's difficult, just because it's hard,

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 just because it's uncomfortable doesn't necessarily equate with toxicity.

370
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 So just think about it like this.

371
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 A toxic work environment will feel something like a toxic physical environment.

372
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 What would be true of a toxic physical environment?

373
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It would promote danger to your physical and mental, emotional, spiritual well-being.

374
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Recently I was out walking.

375
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 There's a trail that goes behind where Brooke and I live,

376
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 and there was an armadillo rummaging in the brush right off to the side of the path.

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That's a really safe environment for that guy to be in.

378
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 What's not a safe environment for him to be in,

379
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 and is extremely toxic to his survival, is the road.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 That would not be a good place for him to be. Why?

381
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Because he is in danger. It is a deadly place for him to be.

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 If you find that your physical or emotional well-being is taking shots,

383
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I think the first thing you must do is you have to consider counsel.

384
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 There's safety in a multitude of counsel.

385
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 You talk to people and you evaluate your state of affairs.

386
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 But then you also reckon with the reality that you don't just pull the ripcord

387
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 and eject out of that situation.

388
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You be prayerful. You consider, "Is God calling me to leave?"

389
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 1 Peter 2, 18-19, it says,

390
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 "Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect,

391
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 not only to the good and the gentle, but also to the unjust.

392
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 For this is a gracious thing.

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 When mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly."

394
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 And he gives the reason for it.

395
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Peter says in verse 21, "For to this you've been called,

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 because Christ also suffered for you,

397
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps.

398
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.

399
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 When he suffered, he did not threaten,

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 but he continued entrusting himself to the one who judges justly."

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 What you see there is Jesus was willing to be persevering

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 in the face of injustice.

404
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And he finished really well, to Caitlin's point.

405
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 - Yeah, and let me address just like work-life balance.

406
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 - Yeah, that's good.

407
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 - That seems to be a huge topic these days.

408
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And what I would say is, I think when you are in your 20s,

409
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 that's really where you're figuring out what you're good at

410
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 and you're becoming highly confident at your job.

411
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And if you want to be great at work,

412
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 you can't be great at like a dozen things, right?

413
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 You can be great at a couple.

414
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And so one of the decisions each of us has got to decide is,

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 what are those things that you want to be great at?

416
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And then I'm going to prioritize that.

417
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 So for me, for much of my work career, it was my walk with Jesus.

418
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 That was first.

419
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Then second was being a husband and father.

420
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And the third was being very good at what I worked at, okay?

421
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So if it touched one of those things, it was priority A.

422
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Everything else was optional.

423
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And so what that meant was is, you know,

424
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I'm not a single-digit handicapper at golf, right?

425
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I'm not a nationally ranked pickleball player, okay?

426
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 There's lots of things I'm not because one of the ways to be good at something

427
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 is to do less of other things, right?

428
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And so being great at it is taking stuff off the plate.

429
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Now, having said that, what I would say is,

430
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 look, anybody in a job can sprint like 100 yards.

431
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 No one can sprint 60 miles, okay?

432
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And so there are jobs where you're asked to go sprint 100 yards or 200 yards.

433
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 That's okay, okay?

434
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 There are other jobs where you're sprinting 60 miles, okay?

435
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I had a job one time where over a three-month period,

436
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 on Mondays and Tuesdays, I was in London, England, okay?

437
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Wednesdays and Thursdays, I was in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

438
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 And Fridays, I was in charge of the recruiting

439
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 for the consulting company I was at,

440
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 so I was all over the business schools in the country, okay?

441
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Now, that's something you can do for a little while.

442
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 That is not a sustainable life, okay?

443
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And so there was a point at which it's like, look,

444
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 what's very clear to me is that it is making demands

445
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 that that's not how I want to live the rest of my life.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And so when we got pregnant with our second child,

447
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I'm like, okay, in eight months, I'm going to be doing something else

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 because I just can't sprint like that.

449
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Okay, but John, like, I've got goals.

450
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Like, I have ambitions.

451
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I have certain marks I need to hit.

452
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I've got a difference I want to make in the world.

453
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I've got to leave an impact with this short life that I have.

454
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 What does it look like to trust the Lord

455
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 while still being ambitious in my career?

456
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Yeah.

457
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I think ambition in and of itself is not a bad thing.

458
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 When you make ambition your identity,

459
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 you are setting yourself up to be disappointed.

460
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 So from my perspective, my story is I, when I,

461
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I made ambition my idol in my 20s.

462
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Like, advertising girl was my whole personality,

463
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 and it was not a good look.

464
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And I just chased that for, and I was one of those people

465
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 that did self-imposed 80-, 90-hour work weeks,

466
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 and everything about me was my job.

467
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I placed my entire identity in my achievement and my performance.

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And the issue is, is that is a moving target,

469
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 and that target never stops moving.

470
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And for me, I chased that and chased it and chased it.

471
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And then the cost was that my health eventually came out.

472
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 So I gave out.

473
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So I had a two-year-long health battle

474
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 because I had worked myself so, so hard.

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 And I had to rebuild not just my body but my identity.

476
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And man, I'm so grateful for the gospel

477
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 that says that we don't have to earn anything.

478
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 He earned it all for us because, man, I was an earner

479
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 and not used to that message.

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So I would say ambition, in and of itself,

481
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 is not a bad thing.

482
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I mean, the Proverbs are filled with Scripture about diligence.

483
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And so, "In excellence we think honors God and inspires men."

484
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 And so I would say there's nothing wrong with ambition,

485
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 but if ambition is your idol, if it is your only motivation,

486
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 you are setting yourself up to be disappointed.

487
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It makes a really bad master.

488
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 - Yeah. - That's awesome.

489
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 - Yeah, or if your value really comes from what you do.

490
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Like, I've lived around the US in a lot of different cities,

491
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and different cities value different things, okay?

492
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So when I lived in Washington, D.C.,

493
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 the very first question people wanted to ask you

494
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 was, "Who do you work for?"

495
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Okay?

496
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Because that is a city that is all about the power.

497
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And it's like, "Do you work for somebody who's somebody?"

498
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Right?

499
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And then, you know, I lived in Boston.

500
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And in Boston, they care a lot about where you went to school.

501
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Right?

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Like, Boston has more schools per capita than anywhere in the US.

503
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And that's how they're deciding the pecking order.

504
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Right?

505
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And then I lived in Los Angeles.

506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Okay?

507
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 What do you think Los Angeles values?

508
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Okay?

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 It's how you look and what you drive.

510
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Okay?

511
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And what I would say to you is Dallas is more like Los Angeles

512
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 than any city I've ever lived in.

513
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And so when you step back, you've got to say,

514
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 "Where am I getting my value?"

515
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And if you're trying to get your value from work,

516
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 okay, that is not a stable place.

517
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 We want to get our value from the fact that God loves us

518
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 and He's for us and He's with us.

519
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Right?

520
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 And if you don't get your value from there,

521
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 you're setting yourself up for a big fall.

522
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 So is it wrong to pursue riches and fame and impact

523
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and influence in the world?

524
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Are those wrong things to pursue?

525
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I would say your gifts are from God for God.

526
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And so my question is, why are you pursuing those?

527
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Is it for your glory or is it for God's glory?

528
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 You are made with a purpose,

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 and that purpose is not to bring yourself glory.

530
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 It's to bring God's glory.

531
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 So I would have a lot of questions about your motivation.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 I don't think that it's wrong to want to make an impact,

533
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 but why do you want to make an impact?

534
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Do you want it to bring your glory or God?

535
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 - Yeah, and I think, you know, Matthew,

536
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Jesus is very clear in the book of Matthew,

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 where He just says, you know,

538
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 "Do not store up for yourselves, you know,

539
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 temporary treasures, where moth and rust destroy

540
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 and thieves can break in and steal,

541
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 but store up for yourselves treasure in heaven."

542
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 So the focus is, is that's the treasure

543
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 we're trying to build up,

544
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 'cause that's the only thing that's gonna last.

545
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And so you want to think long-term, right?

546
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 You want to invest in long-term things.

547
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 And the one thing that's long-term

548
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 is your relationship with Jesus and doing eternal things.

549
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 - 1 Timothy 6, 9 says,

550
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 "But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."

551
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 In the operative word there is desire,

552
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 "who desire to be rich, fall into temptation,

553
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires

554
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 that plunge people into ruin and destruction."

555
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And then y'all know this famously,

556
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 "For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil."

557
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 See, it's not that money or wealth or influence

558
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 or difference-making, whatever it is,

559
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 it's not that those things are inherently wrong.

560
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 They are morally neutral.

561
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 I think what Caitlin and John are saying is

562
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 your love is not intended for those things.

563
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Your love is intended for God and God alone, right?

564
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 His love has been lavished upon you

565
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and in response to a love embraced

566
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 becomes a love that we return to God

567
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 and we extend to other people.

568
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Now, God may give you wealth.

569
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 He may give you fame.

570
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 He may give you influence.

571
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Truthfully, believers are the best to steward those resources

572
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 because God doesn't give to you,

573
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 He gives through you, right?

574
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 He's not impacting by you.

575
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 He's impacting through you.

576
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 This is the way that God works.

577
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 He works through His people

578
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 and it's a delight for Him to partner with those

579
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 that are subject to Him first and foremost.

580
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 One thing that I think in the vein of ambition

581
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 that I think is worth talking about in this moment

582
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 is a lot of people,

583
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 they'll fall prey to, Caitlin, your story of workaholism.

584
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Right? Like they will--

585
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 - I think it's glamorized in America.

586
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 - Yeah, it totally is.

587
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Especially amongst young adults, hustle culture's a thing.

588
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 - Absolutely.

589
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 - So what does it look like for us to both hustle on the job

590
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 while being healthy in life?

591
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 - Mm-hmm.

592
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 You know, my first boss, when I worked in advertising

593
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 and I was in that season that I described to you of working,

594
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 a lot of it was self-imposed, 80, 90,

595
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 'cause my entire identity was on my performance.

596
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 He said to me something that I'll never forget.

597
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 He said, "Caitlin, there's a cost to working as hard as you do,

598
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 "and the problem is you won't know what the cost is

599
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 "until you've already paid it."

600
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And for me, it was my health, but for others,

601
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 I think it could be community, it could be your spiritual life,

602
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 it could be friendships.

603
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 So my question, especially if you're caught up in this hustle culture,

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 is are you paying attention to what it's costing you,

605
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 not just what you're getting out of it,

606
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 and is it worth the cost?

607
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And then I think on a really practical side,

608
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 God has given you a body to steward,

609
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 and it's very important to steward your body,

610
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 and I mean to pay attention to your health

611
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 and the health of your relationships,

612
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 emotionally, spiritually, and physically,

613
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 in the midst of your job.

614
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And so when you start to get really off balance,

615
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 something is wrong, and so if you can orient yourself

616
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 to your purpose in the Lord,

617
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 often those things kind of right themselves,

618
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 but it is so important to pay attention

619
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 to your physical, emotional, and spiritual health.

620
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 That's great. John, would you add anything to this?

621
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Yeah, I would say a couple of things.

622
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 One, it's your job to keep yourself healthy.

623
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 In general, bosses do not do a good job

624
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 of checking out on your health.

625
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 So Caitlin's boss, that's an exception.

626
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Most of them are happy if you want to stay later and do more stuff.

627
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And what I would say is when you are looking at a job,

628
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 the boss sets the tone for the culture.

629
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And that's how long you work,

630
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 what kind of values you pursue,

631
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 whether it's a competitive environment or a collaborative one.

632
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And so that's who's going to set the pace.

633
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And so if you're thinking about a job,

634
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 that's who you want to look at

635
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 to decide is that going to be a good fit in that culture.

636
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And you're looking for someone who's going to value that.

637
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And it's not just looking to churn you up and spit you out.

638
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 So how do we know when too much is being asked of us on the job?

639
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 You want to take it, John?

640
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Yeah, well, here's what I would say is you know it at the extremes.

641
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And again, what I would say is sprinting for 100 yards,

642
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 anybody can do that.

643
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 And there are times in all of our jobs

644
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 when we're asked to stay late.

645
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Or there's an urgent project that needs to get done.

646
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 The challenge is when that moves from being the exception to the norm.

647
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Because now you're trying to sprint six miles or 60 miles.

648
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And nobody can do that.

649
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 And so it's okay to sprint,

650
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 but you just want to have this, not this red line at the top.

651
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Totally.

652
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And that's where knowing yourself is really important.

653
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Knowing if you are prone to overwork

654
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 or if you're prone, to just be honest, y'all, to prone to underwork.

655
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Like you should take an -- you owe it to yourself

656
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 to take an honest assessment of where you fall on that scale.

657
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 And let others into that to go, hey, that's just --

658
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 like they're both just as damaging to underwork or to overwork.

659
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 And so I would encourage you to take an honest assessment of yourself

660
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 and let your community into knowing like, hey, this is my ditch.

661
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 My ditch is actually to overwork.

662
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 And in that scenario, you might want to have people lean into the pride

663
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 you might be getting from that overworking.

664
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 If it's underworking, you might want to take assessment to see --

665
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 has entitlement crept into your heart somewhere

666
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 that you feel like you're entitled to take a two-hour lunch break

667
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 because you're working remote today and nobody will notice, right?

668
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And so just -- you owe it to yourself now to take an honest assessment

669
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 and invite others into helping you maintain that balance.

670
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 That's really good.

671
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 One of my favorite verses, which you may think is funny,

672
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 but it's from the Bible, is Proverbs 6.

673
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 It says, "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider his ways and be wise."

674
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 What's the author saying in that verse?

675
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Consider the ant who's productive.

676
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Like the ant knows when to work and when to rest.

677
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 I think that that is such an important concept for us to grasp

678
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 because we tend to go one way or the other.

679
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 We'll burn the candle at both ends or we won't light the candle at all.

680
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And yet what you see is that God has set a precedent for us.

681
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 He worked for six days.

682
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 He accomplished a lot in six days.

683
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 He was maximally productive.

684
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And then he rested on the seventh.

685
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 I think a lot of us will see that God worked,

686
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 and so I'm going to work, I'm going to put it out.

687
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And yet you just probably need to take some time and rest.

688
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 You probably need to take a day, and you need to rest, you need to reflect,

689
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 and you need to do something recreationally.

690
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 And yet others of us--and I've seen this within the church

691
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 over the last couple of years.

692
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 We have idolized this idea of Sabbath.

693
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 We've looked at it and we've said, "Man, I must have rest in my life,

694
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 and so I'm going to really pull things back."

695
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 And it's like, well, God took a day to do it,

696
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 and so let's not take this thing further than it should.

697
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Let's be really well-balanced as we consider working and resting.

698
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 We're coming here to the end of our time,

699
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 and so what I want to do is I want to just turn--

700
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 because one thing that we know--and we unpacked this again two weeks ago.

701
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 We talked about, "Man, when we consider work on the job

702
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 and what's God's purpose for it,"

703
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 so often we're prone to just think, "I'm supposed to disciple

704
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 the people that are around me.

705
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I'm supposed to invest and share the gospel with my coworkers."

706
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 That's a big part of it.

707
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 The other part of it, though, is what Genesis 2:15 would say,

708
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 "We're supposed to have dominion and work the earth.

709
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 We're supposed to take what's true of the garden.

710
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 We're supposed to make it true of the rest of the world."

711
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 We've spent a lot of time talking about that,

712
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 but it is still true that there is a witnessing component

713
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 to being on the job.

714
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And so I'm just going to ask the simplest of questions here,

715
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 and I'd love for you all to speak to it.

716
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 What does it look like to represent Jesus on the job?

717
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 As you look back at your corporate experience,

718
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 how did you all do it in those environments?

719
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 For me, it was a lot more about the small moments

720
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 than I think the little moments.

721
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 And what I mean by that, I think--the big moments, excuse me.

722
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 So I think the big moments come in that you think of a time

723
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 where you shared the gospel or you said no to when your boss

724
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 was asking you to do something immoral.

725
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Those are important, big, dramatic moments of sharing the gospel.

726
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Absolutely important.

727
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 But the little moments, I think the concept there of being set apart,

728
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Colossians 3:12, that you're God's chosen people set apart

729
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 and sanctified for his purpose.

730
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 How can you be set apart in small things?

731
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Things like your tone of voice, your tone when you communicate.

732
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Are you being passive aggressive?

733
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Gossip, which I think in the workplace a lot of times we say,

734
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 "I just seen an event about my boss."

735
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 No, that's gossip.

736
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 So being set apart there, right?

737
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Are you taking part in a culture of crude joking, of drinking?

738
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 How can you be set apart in those?

739
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And then taking an opportunity when people ask you

740
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 why you don't partake or why you're set apart

741
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 to relate it back to your faith.

742
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 So for me, it's often been about the small things.

743
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 When people ask me why I'm not excessively drinking at a happy hour,

744
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 well, it's because I'm a person of faith.

745
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 Can I tell you about that, right?

746
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 So capitalize on those small moments.

747
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Yeah, and I think the great thing about faith and work

748
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 is you get to see most of those people consistently, right?

749
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 So it's not one conversation.

750
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 It's more about a lifestyle.

751
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 And I think what I've learned is, one,

752
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 you want to be authentic about your faith.

753
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Just be authentic about it.

754
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 And when people know that about you and you're trying to live it out,

755
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 there will be a respect that comes from that.

756
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 So that's part of it.

757
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Second, you just want to share what God's doing in your life

758
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 because it's your story.

759
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Hey, let me tell you what God's doing in my life.

760
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 And that is a way of pulling them in

761
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 so that they can be a witness of how God is at work in you.

762
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And then I think the third thing is

763
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 a lot of times when we share the gospel with somebody,

764
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 they'll say something like, "Oh, that's really interesting.

765
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 I'm really glad that works for you."

766
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 And what I would say is that's not the end of the process.

767
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 That's the start of the process.

768
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Because your job, once you have that conversation,

769
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 is you want to love that person in such a way

770
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 that when something goes wrong in their life,

771
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 you're the very first person they call.

772
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And that just means you love them, you care about them,

773
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 you encourage them.

774
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 And look, life is difficult.

775
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Sooner or later for all of us, things go wrong

776
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 and people begin to question.

777
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And you want them to call you.

778
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 You know, 'cause that's the path into a life of faith.

779
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 - I had a professional mentor tell me one time

780
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 that on the job, you bless people

781
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 as far as they will let you bless them.

782
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Because at some point,

783
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 they are going to come looking for your blessing.

784
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Like there is something deeply infectious

785
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 about the gospel,

786
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 the way it impacts the lives of God's people.

787
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 It leads us to be kind when other people are not kind.

788
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 It leads us to work hard when everyone else is phoning it in.

789
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 It leads us to be patient when no one else has patience

790
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 for that person or that situation.

791
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 It causes us to speak words of wisdom

792
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 whenever a problem arises and no one else has a solution.

793
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 The impact of walking with God

794
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 will make you a better employee.

795
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 And here's the thing, people love to work alongside,

796
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 advance, and promote good employees.

797
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 But that's not why we do it.

798
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 We do it because we have a Savior

799
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 that has gone above and beyond.

800
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 He has worked to a great degree

801
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 to satisfy that which we could not satisfy ourselves.

802
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 John, Caitlin, thank you so much.

803
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 You are a great job of helping.

804
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Big thanks to John and Caitlin.

805
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 Thank you all so much.

806
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Thank you guys.

807
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 You know, over the course of this evening,

808
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 we really took the questions that you asked

809
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 and we boiled them down to three different categories.

810
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And the categories that they boiled down to

811
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 were really purpose, balance, and witness on the job.

812
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Like that's the broad strokes of everything that y'all asked.

813
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 We didn't get to every single question,

814
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 but that's really at the heart of you

815
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 and the people sitting alongside of you

816
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 is this question of, man, what does it look like for me

817
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 to have purpose on the job?

818
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 How do I find balance between working really well

819
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 while also still being healthy,

820
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 not succumbing to something toxic or difficult or dangerous?

821
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 And then how is it that I can witness

822
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 and be faithful to the faith that I carry,

823
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 that I claim?

824
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 I stake my eternity on Jesus,

825
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 so how then do I stake my job on Him as well?

826
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 These are the questions y'all have been asking.

827
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Here's what I would end our time with by just reminding you.

828
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Your purpose at work,

829
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 it's secured and it's solidified

830
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 when you consider Christ's purpose in life.

831
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 That His purpose was to seek you out

832
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 when you were unworthy of being sought.

833
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Like He was willing to go the distance to get to you

834
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 when everything around Him said, "It's not worth it.

835
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 "They're not worth it."

836
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 His purpose was even still,

837
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 "I want them to be with me where I am."

838
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 As you think about balance,

839
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 Jesus endured the most toxic of environments.

840
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 He stepped into a world that was not habitable

841
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 for a perfect loving God,

842
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 and yet He in His perfection came to a people

843
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 that were totally imperfect,

844
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 that He might restore to you

845
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 a balanced relationship with God Himself.

846
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 How did He do it?

847
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 He did it by embracing all of our imperfection.

848
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 He lived the life we couldn't.

849
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 You could not be perfect,

850
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and so He came and He was perfect in your place.

851
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 He absorbed the full weight of your consequence,

852
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 your sin, in dying the death you deserved upon the cross.

853
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 And then He rose forth from the grave,

854
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 and He witnesses to the watching world

855
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 the same way you should witness at your watching work,

856
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 that He is alive,

857
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 that He didn't just die and stay dead,

858
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 but He rose forth from the grave,

859
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 and He has made not just eternity out there forever

860
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 and in the future available to any

861
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 that would place their faith in God,

862
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 but purpose and relationship and meaning.

863
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 It's available right here, right now, even this evening,

864
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 if only you would place your faith in Him.

865
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 Do you know Him?

866
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 Before you can work well,

867
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 you've got to work things out with Him.

868
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 He's come that you might work those things through tonight.

869
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Let me pray for us.

870
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 God, we love you.

871
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 So grateful for an evening where, God,

872
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 we can just take the truth of your word,

873
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 and we can apply it right to our lives.

874
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 Every person in here, God, is wrapped up in a work situation.

875
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 And yet, God, though this is true for all of us,

876
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 I know there's a broad spectrum of circumstance in here

877
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 that some of us love our jobs,

878
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 and others of us hate our job,

879
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 and some of us are,

880
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 we're stuck in the mundanity of our career,

881
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 and others of us have deep meaning in the things we do.

882
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 God, there is a broad array of experience here in this room,

883
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 and yet, God, you have come to declare

884
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 there is purpose in what you do.

885
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 I've come to give you balance while you work there,

886
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 and I've also called you to be a witness

887
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 to save the world the same way I have saved you.

888
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 God, would you work amongst my friends here?

889
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Would you lead us, Lord, to know you more?

890
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 And would we make a difference in our workplaces

891
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 for your glory and the good of others?

892
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 It's in Christ, and we pray.
