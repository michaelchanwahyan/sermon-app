[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.720]   >> Well, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.600]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.280]   >> Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.640]   Welcome to the Porch.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.560]   If this is your first time ever with us, I'm so
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.920]   thankful that you're trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.080]   I hope that this place feels like home very quickly.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.280]   I do wanna give a quick shout out to all of the Porch Live locations that are
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.280]   watching online right now, like you Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Midland.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.640]   Porch Live Atlanta is watching tonight, which is amazing.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240]   This is such a great night to be at the Porch.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.080]   I'm so glad that you made it.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.000]   And it's gonna be amazing, and it already has been amazing, but
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.480]   I'm so glad that you're gonna get to hear from my friend, Louie Giglio, tonight.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   Sorry, Louie.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.480]   Louie and his wife, Shelly, are here with us from Atlanta, and
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.000]   they have been really shaping forces in my life and in my wife's life for years now.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.640]   And so it's such a joy to get to have him here at Watermark and
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.480]   at the Porch to invest in you.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.240]   If you're not familiar with Louie,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.320]   he is truly one of the greatest visionaries and communicators of our day.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   And I don't know if you've ever been to a passion conference.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.160]   Anyone been to a passion conference before?
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.680]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.960]   >> Yeah, the passion conference back in 2000.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.080]   I don't know what you were doing in 2000.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.200]   You were like four back then.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.920]   Some of you are like, no, I was one.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.520]   Okay, anyway, that's fine.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.400]   That was the first time that I actually lifted my hands in worship.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.760]   I was like, I'm gonna do it.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.440]   Like, if I do it, there's no turning back, but let's just go for it.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.920]   And I just was full extension, and I was like, okay, I guess I'm a hand raiser now,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.960]   because that's the impact that passion has.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.120]   But on a serious note, back in 1997, a movement was birthed.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.320]   And since that time, every year, tens of thousands of young adults
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.960]   have gathered together for one purpose, and it's to lift up the name of Jesus.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.840]   And so it just makes perfect sense for Louie and
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.280]   the passion team to be with us here at the Porch tonight.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.520]   Because if you don't know why we exist, we exist to call any and
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.840]   every young adult to see Jesus and to surrender fully to life with him.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.520]   And passion exists for the name and the renown of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.480]   And what I'm so thankful for is the fact that the message has never wavered
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.640]   since 1997.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.600]   And so my hope tonight is that you would see Jesus clearly,
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.360]   that you would surrender fully to life with him, and
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   that the Spirit of God would do a great work in your life as you hear
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.520]   Louie teach the word of God.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.200]   So would you do an incredible job of just welcoming Louie Giglio tonight?
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.560]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.560]   >> Nobody wants to see this,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.520]   Shelley said.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.240]   Okay, I'm gonna preach with one hand, which I can do, and it'll be awesome.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.520]   I was saying how much I love TA, and how much excited I am that we're here.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.440]   It's 57 days, if I can get that woo-hoo one more time.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.520]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.240]   >> Until Passion 2024, and
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.840]   I'm telling you, we've been doing this 27 years.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.480]   And it's never the same, it's not routine, it's not an event,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.800]   it's not a conference, it's not a thing.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.160]   It really truly is wind of God.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.400]   And we're gonna be in Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.200]   It's one of the most amazing football stadiums aside from the one over there in
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.240]   the world.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.480]   And it's gonna be jammed with 18 to 25 year olds going after Jesus.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.600]   And so one of the reasons why we're here tonight is we're knocking on doors all
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.480]   over America, because we wanna invite everybody we can to be a part of this
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.000]   gathering.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.520]   A lot of you are like, hey, hello, past 25 a minute ago, so thanks for coming.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.240]   But you can still be a part.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.680]   We need hundreds more door holders to come alongside of us.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.520]   We need people to pray for us.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.200]   You can provide a scholarship for an 18 to 25 year old who can't quite get over
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.560]   that hurdle this year.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.120]   There's a lot of ways you can get involved.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.840]   And if you're 18 to 25, you have to be there.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   You're like, our family is going skiing.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.880]   I don't care, cancel it.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.880]   Tell them I can't come, my knee went out.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.320]   I mean, it doesn't matter what's on the radar.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.840]   These are moments that you can't get back in time, and
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.960]   I don't know how many of them there'll be in life.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.400]   We've been in a few stadiums a few times, but it's beautiful, it's rare,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.720]   it's amazing.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.440]   And it was worth me coming to Dallas TA tonight just to knock on the door of
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.040]   the porch and hope somebody opened the door and say, come to Passion.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.960]   You won't regret it.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.960]   In fact, it'll change your life, and there's 27 years of history to back that up.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.240]   Anybody had their life changed at a Passion gathering in any way, shape, or
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.440]   form somewhere along the way?
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.320]   Anybody in this room?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.200]   Can I just see a hand?
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.760]   Okay, there's a few hands across the room.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.920]   It's powerful and amazing.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.880]   The second reason that Shelly and I came to the porch tonight is because I have a
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.960]   message for somebody, and I have a stirring in my heart.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.520]   And the key thing, and TA is going to amen this really good and loud,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.280]   we don't preach our stirrings, and we don't preach our impressions.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.640]   We preach God's word.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.920]   But we get stirrings, and we get impressions.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.200]   And so I like to share my stirrings and impressions as simply that,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.000]   a stirring and impression.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.560]   But I'm going to preach the word of God tonight, but I have a stirring alongside
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.760]   the word of God tonight, and it is a word for somebody.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.920]   And it might be one of you guys in Midland.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.840]   And it's a word for somebody who has known in your life that God had a
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.440]   purpose for you.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.040]   It was clear.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.520]   It was not arbitrary.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.480]   It wasn't something that you kind of dreamed up.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   You knew God had spoken over your life.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.520]   You are on purpose.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.800]   You have a mission.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.280]   You have a destination.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.720]   But here you are in this moment right now, and your ship is going down.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.080]   It is falling apart.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.280]   It is busting at every corner, and it is going down tonight.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:05.680]   And you are going, "I thought I was going somewhere with God on purpose,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.800]   but right now, it pretty much looks like I'm going down to the bottom of the sea."
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.160]   And I came here tonight with a message for you from the word of God.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.360]   Lord, I pray tonight that you would speak to all of us in this room,
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.080]   but especially to the person who just got sweaty palms in this moment and knows
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:33.720]   that somehow the God of heaven knows that they are in the room right now.
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.200]   Holy Spirit, would you stir this word up like Mel was praying?
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.080]   Will you set it on fire tonight again one more time to move in our hearts?
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.560]   Nobody in this room, including me, needs to hear anything that I think or have to say.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.920]   But everyone in this room, including me, needs to hear from you.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:59.160]   So I'm trusting you again to move in power.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   So the question tonight is, how would life be different for you
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.720]   if you knew that you had everything you need?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.920]   If just in the snap of a finger tonight, you knew, "I've got everything I need
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.480]   for my life, for me, and for my situation, and for the future.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.840]   I got everything I need."
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.600]   How would life be different for you?
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.480]   The text tonight is found in Acts 27.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   It's a story that if you've been around church, you're sort of familiar with,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.920]   maybe not all the fine details because a doctor is recording these journeys of,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   in this case, the Apostle Paul, and he's very, very detailed.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:48.880]   And so there is a lot of geography and a lot of detail in this story that we're going
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.800]   to look at tonight.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.640]   And what I love about it is all the geography is real, and you can go
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.080]   to all these places, and you can trace the steps that we're reading about tonight.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.600]   This isn't some ancient storybook.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.080]   This is real, and this story happened in the real world.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.800]   And in the midst of this story, Paul, one of the leaders of the new church
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.480]   after the resurrection of Jesus, is on his way to Rome.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   He's been arrested in Jerusalem.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.960]   He's been falsely accused, but he's appealed to his rights as a Roman
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.560]   citizen to go and stand trial in Rome.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.280]   So he's on his way to Rome, and he wants to ultimately stand before the most
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.800]   powerful man in the world at this point.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.600]   He wants to stand in front of Caesar.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.320]   And this is the call that's on his life.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.760]   But they set out to sail.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.360]   At a bad time of year, they got caught up in this massive storm,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.600]   and things are going sideways in a hurry.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.840]   It says in verse 20 of chapter 27 that, "Neither sun nor stars appeared for many
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.440]   days, and the storm continued raging.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.080]   We finally gave up all hope of being saved."
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.840]   You ever been there before, where it's just been pile on after pile on,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.680]   train wreck after train wreck, unanswered prayer after unanswered prayer?
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.440]   And finally, you said, "There's no way out of this situation.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.520]   We are not going to make it through this."
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.200]   Verse 21, "After the men had gone a long time without food,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:30.520]   Paul stood up before them and said, 'Men, you should have taken my advice not to
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.400]   sail from Crete.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.520]   Then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.200]   But now I urge you to keep up your courage because not one of you will be lost.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.720]   Only the ship will be destroyed.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:55.240]   Last night, an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me and
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.160]   said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:04.360]   You must stand trial before Caesar, and God has graciously given you the lives of
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.880]   all who sail with you.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:13.200]   So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.680]   he told me.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.920]   Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.'"
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.840]   And then the little header in between the verses before the next verse in my Bible
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   says, "The shipwreck," and the next whole section is all about the running aground
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.000]   and throwing everything overboard and the ship breaking apart and people ultimately
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.440]   having to fend for themselves and swim to the shore.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.240]   But they all do, and all 276 of them make it to shore.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.240]   The ship is trashed, but the people make it to shore.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.920]   And the thing that Paul is confident of is an angel has appeared to me, and the angel
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.800]   has given me a message tonight.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.120]   And the message he's given me is, "You're going to stand before Caesar."
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   Why was that the message?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.940]   The message should have been, "Here, jump off the right side.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.640]   Swim to the left because it's going to be early morning and dark.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   Here's the survival tips that you need."
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.440]   No, the word to him was, "You're going to not die and you're going to make it to Caesar."
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.920]   What was he saying?
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.600]   He was saying the first thing that I want us to hear tonight from God.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.860]   "You're going to make it to the destination that God has appointed for your life."
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.080]   Not one amen for that.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.280]   Hello?
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.960]   Are we all together here?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:43.360]   "You're going to make it to the appointed destination that God has for your life."
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.600]   There's so many people in this place tonight, and your ship is going down, and maybe God's
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.820]   not going to stop that.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.920]   Maybe there is going to be a shipwreck, and God isn't going to intervene in that part
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.420]   of the story.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:01.800]   But what he's wanting to speak to us tonight is that we're going to make it where God has
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:07.200]   sent us to accomplish what God has appointed us to do.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.960]   All the way back in Acts chapter 9, Paul was on his way to wipe out some Christians.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.440]   He was a hater of the way of Jesus.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.760]   But he met Jesus while he was on the way to this town to persecute the followers of Jesus,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.840]   and he had a vision of Jesus.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.600]   He got saved and changed and transformed.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.160]   He also got blinded by the very presence of Jesus when he saw him.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.880]   So he got led by the hand into this town nearby where he was going, and God spoke to a believer
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.440]   in that town and said, "Hey, I need you to go to this place over here because Saul of
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.360]   Tarsus is over there, and I need you to pray for him."
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.120]   And the man was like, "There's no way I'm going to go pray for Saul because he's killing
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.680]   all of us."
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.740]   And then the Lord said in verse 15 to Ananias, "Go.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:05.480]   This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.160]   and before the people of Israel.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.640]   I'll show him how much he must suffer for my name."
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:19.560]   In other words, this mission, this calling, this purpose, this incredible act of God to
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.120]   invite Paul into the story wasn't going to be easy.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.960]   There was going to be some suffering in the journey, and one of the suffering moments
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.880]   we're looking at right here in chapter 27, there have been a whole lot worse suffering
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.080]   moments along the way.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.160]   You say, "Why was there so much suffering?"
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:40.260]   Because the enemy hated the message of Jesus and tried to kill it from day one, and leading
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.760]   voice for it from the beginning was this guy.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.340]   So he ran into the darkness everywhere he went.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:51.720]   He ran into opposition everywhere he went because he was preaching the gospel everywhere
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.840]   that he went.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.160]   But what did Paul, what did God say to Ananias?
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.160]   "This man is my chosen instrument, and I got a purpose for him.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.280]   He's going to preach to the Gentiles and to their kings."
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:12.400]   In other words, he's going to the top, and not even a two-week storm where neither sun
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:21.320]   nor moon has been seen is going to stop my mission to get him to Caesar.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.360]   And whatever's happening in your life might be real tonight.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.160]   And I'm not trying to put us all on the ship.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.920]   You know, good preaching isn't, "Okay, we're all on our boat right now, and here's nine
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.040]   ways to survive a storm on your boat when you're at sea."
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.640]   That's not good preaching.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.600]   The message of this story is not that we're on a ship.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:45.180]   The message of this story is that even shipwrecks don't wreck God.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.860]   And there have been a lot of shipwrecks in the story, right?
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.860]   And the enemy wants to define you by the two weeks of no sun, no moon.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.620]   He wants to define you by, "I told you you shouldn't have gone that way."
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.220]   He wants to define you by, "Hey, I told you when we left port in Crete this was a bad
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.840]   idea, but oh, you decided we were going to go anyway."
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.220]   All that's real.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.300]   But here's the thing.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.960]   God is greater than that, and if you trust Him tonight, if you turn to Him tonight, He'll
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.460]   still put you back on course.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.140]   It may not be without the loss of the ship, but He will save you.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.420]   He'll save you, and He'll move you into purpose.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.980]   A lot of you thought you were going to be somewhere else about this point in life, and
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.180]   you're not quite where you thought you were going to be yet.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.700]   Some of you are right where you thought you were going to be.
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.500]   Some of you had no idea where you were going to be and still don't have any idea where
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.500]   you were going to be.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.620]   You're just hoping at some point tonight God will maybe say, "This is where you're going
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620]   to be."
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:51.420]   I'm telling you all of us right now are in a position to say to God, "I believe You,
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:59.420]   and I believe that You will and are accomplishing Your purpose for me.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:06.900]   I trust You to put my life on the course of Your purpose and Your plan."
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:13.420]   Man, that's a powerful, powerful word.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.100]   I was asking the question earlier, how would life be different for you if you knew you
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.700]   had all you need?
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.180]   You know, somebody's probably going to read this.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.020]   I was reading this a couple of weeks ago, and I was like, "Well, hello, if I had an
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:33.140]   angel of the Lord, whose I am and whom I serve, appear to me in the middle of the night in
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:40.020]   my storm and talk to me and remind me and tell me and encourage me and convince me,
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.580]   yeah, I'd probably be a little more courageous too.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.300]   I would probably have a little more confidence also if an angel came in the middle of the
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   night."
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.920]   Well, here's point number two tonight.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.180]   You have way more encouragement than an angel visit in the night.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.840]   You're like, "Man, if an angel ever showed up at my house, I'm telling you what, things
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   would be different.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.980]   My attitude would be different.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.060]   My mind would be right.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.460]   I would have a lot more peace and a lot more confidence and a lot more boldness in God.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.580]   I would talk different, act different, encourage the people around me different.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.700]   I would completely be different if an angel showed up."
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:22.900]   Well, what if an angel didn't show up, but what if God, by His sovereign will, put His
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:31.060]   words, thoughts, plans, and promises for you in writing so that you would have them inspired
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:38.120]   and living by the Spirit of God for every single moment of your life?
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:48.060]   And He handed it miraculously to you over centuries of preservation and said, "Here,
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.940]   I want you to know what I think about you.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.860]   Could you just come just for a second right there on the aisle, my friend right on the
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.060]   third aisle with the dark jacket?
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.600]   Yeah, could you come just for a second?
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.600]   You have an earpiece, Ed.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   You're doing something official.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600]   Go back to your seat.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.980]   I'll go with the Baylor young lady right in front of you."
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   Easy, easy.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.980]   Easy.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.980]   It's been a rough season.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:17.620]   It's been a rough year.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.020]   By the way, hi, can you just hang on just for one second?
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.380]   I'm not going to make you stand there long.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.940]   In fact, I'm not making you stand there.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.820]   You don't have to stand there if you don't want to, but if you could just for like 30
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.860]   more seconds, it would be awesome.
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.700]   Speaking of Baylor, that's where I met my wife.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.820]   She was a Baylor student when we met.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.660]   We met in Houston, but I ended up going to grad school there.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.780]   So we lived in Waco for a while.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.700]   So I just wanted to announce, I forgot to do this earlier, what a wonderful time of
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.940]   year it is in Dallas, Texas.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.220]   Because A, you won the World Series.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.780]   Thank you very much.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:05.060]   But greater news than that, it's currently 77 degrees outside.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.740]   It is almost Ugg weather in Dallas, Texas.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.380]   Couple more degrees and Uggs are everywhere.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.380]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.020]   I don't know if Waco is probably not down to 77 yet.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.500]   Anyway, I'm sorry I'm making you stand there.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.900]   It's as if God was saying to you, "I want you to know what I think about you.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.260]   I want you to know where you came from.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.500]   I want you to know where you're going.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.940]   I want you to know what you can count on.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.300]   I want you to know what you can depend on.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.400]   I want you to know where to look.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.380]   I want you to know who's holding you.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:41.660]   I want you to know everything.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.100]   I made that for you.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:50.620]   That's me for you."
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.300]   Do you understand?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   Thank you so much.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:02.940]   She's like, "Are you giving me your Bible?"
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:13.220]   And we just kind of, you know, we're struggling.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:19.940]   And a lot of us are hoping that something miraculous happens.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.020]   Like we need an angel to show up.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:31.580]   And God is like, "I mean, I've never had an angel show up and tell me anything, but I've
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:40.620]   had God speak to me."
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.900]   I was asking, what was I asking earlier?
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:55.420]   How would your life be different if you knew you had all you needed?
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.220]   This Saint Paul made it through this storm.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.100]   He made it to where he wanted to go.
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:08.500]   He got to Rome, got to preach the gospel there, got to appeal to the highest authority, got
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.740]   his message to the center of humanity at that time.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:20.140]   And then he died for the faith that he believed in in Jesus.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:28.900]   But he had written, inspired by the Holy Spirit, letters to believers all over Asia Minor.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.040]   And they're in the word of God.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.140]   And so when you just turn a few pages over from where this ship is falling apart and
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:41.780]   going down to the bottom of the sea, when you're thinking, man, life can get crazy,
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:47.060]   it can get crazy, but this guy on this ship has such a calling on his life that a few
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:52.280]   pages later we're in Romans chapter 8, and this is what we're reading in verse 15.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.460]   This is God speaking to you.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:01.080]   For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.620]   the spirit of sonship or daughtership.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.140]   And by him we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:18.140]   Hello, we get to speak to Yahweh on intimate terms and call him Abba.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.300]   Why?
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.980]   Because we have received a new spirit.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.900]   And it is not the spirit of nobodies.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.820]   It is not the spirit of forsaken.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.680]   It is not the spirit of unwanted.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.100]   It is not the spirit of forgotten.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.420]   It is not the spirit of not good enough.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:45.180]   It is the spirit of sonship and daughtership whereby our spirit now calls Yahweh Abba,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.040]   Father.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.780]   This is crazy.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.540]   And by him we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:02.580]   The spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:13.480]   Now if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.540]   If indeed we share in his sufferings, we're going to have some shipwrecks too for the
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.980]   gospel in order that we may also share in his glory.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.140]   And we know a few verses down that in all things God works.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.760]   Can we just say that together?
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.260]   And we know that in – let's just try it together.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:40.080]   And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, I'll read
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.820]   on now, who have been called according to his purpose.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.180]   For those God foreknew, he predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.280]   he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.660]   And those he predestined, he also called.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.900]   And those he called, he also justified.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.620]   And those he justified, he also glorified.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.420]   What then shall we say in response to this?
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.440]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.980]   He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:20.100]   How will he not also, along with his own Son, graciously give us all things?
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:26.300]   Who can bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.580]   A few verses down, Paul keeps writing, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.660]   Shall trouble or hardship or shipwreck or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.660]   or sword?
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:42.820]   As it's written, 'For your sake we face death all day long.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.700]   We're considered as sheep to be slaughtered.'
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:51.980]   No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:26:00.020]   For I'm convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels or demons, the present
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:06.460]   or the future, nor powers, neither height or depth, or anything else in all creation
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:15.340]   will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:26.100]   Man, I just wish an angel would come and encourage me.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:37.500]   If only an angel would come and say what?
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.980]   Say what?
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.700]   If just an angel would show up.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:57.460]   And if he did, he would probably say, "Have you seen this stuff in Romans 8?"
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:05.720]   So Paul swims ashore and they all make it, 276 of them.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.940]   In verse 1 of the next chapter, kind of winding down, it says, "Went safely on shore, we
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.340]   found out that the island was called Malta."
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:18.220]   Anybody been to Malta?
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:25.780]   It's a real travel opportunity there for anybody who's got a business going, trips to Malta.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.700]   There's one hand back there for real.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700]   Yes?
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.820]   Awesome, thank you so much.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.820]   Just checking.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.580]   I just wanted to make sure that we know this is a real place.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.060]   I was nervous for a minute, but it is a real place.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.900]   One person has been there.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.980]   The islanders showed us unusual kindness.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.220]   They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.760]   Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and as he put it on the fire, a viper driven out by
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.060]   the heat fastened itself on his hand.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.060]   When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, now this just creeps me out just
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.620]   even reading it.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.820]   This wasn't like an attack bite, bam, bam.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:11.120]   This thing stuck on his hand and is hanging on his hand.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.420]   That's like traumatizing.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:19.080]   Not only did something bite me, but now the thing that bit me is clamped down on my hand
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:25.700]   and hanging there.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.980]   When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:36.860]   must be a murderer for though he escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.220]   Justice being one of their gods.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:46.420]   But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.860]   The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.480]   That's not a really good fate, is it?
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.620]   One of those two options.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.700]   But after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.020]   minds and said he was a god.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.100]   Now this again, I don't want to read too much into this text, but I think we can mine out
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.020]   of this text right here and right now.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:12.820]   Don't put too much weight in other people's opinions.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.460]   The same people who thought you were a demon now think you're a god.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.980]   People who were against you five minutes ago are for you right now.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.440]   I think you need to put your hope in what God thinks about you and not in what people
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.980]   think about you.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:32.300]   But what I want to bring out of this text is that when you're convinced, you start shaking
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.140]   more things off.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:42.300]   Remember we were in Romans 8 just a minute ago and it says, "But we are convinced."
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.540]   Not of, you know, gentle opinion, but we're convinced.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:56.660]   And I want to ask tonight at the porch, is anybody convinced tonight?
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:03.300]   Paul in a different place, in a different letter, said that he persuaded men.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.620]   And that's what I do.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.600]   That's what I'm doing right now.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.500]   And I'm good at it.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.880]   I've been doing it almost all my life.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:20.300]   God has wired me up to be a good persuader, but I can't convince anybody.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.000]   Only the Holy Spirit can do that.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.600]   So I'm persuading, but the Holy Spirit has to do the convincing.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.460]   And we need more convinced people.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.020]   You know, like convinced of what?
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:38.420]   Convinced of the reality that God has a purpose and a plan and a destiny for my life.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:45.840]   And no matter what has come against me, God can still fulfill His purpose for me.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.800]   And even if I'm in two weeks of no moon, no sun, that doesn't mean God isn't at work and
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.880]   it doesn't mean God doesn't have a plan anymore.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.720]   It just means right now I've got to hold on to the promise that I got from Him for my
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   life.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.860]   That He isn't going to be overwhelmed by the situation.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:11.520]   He is going to complete the purpose for which He has sent me out.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   You believe that tonight?
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.740]   Are you convinced of that tonight?
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.080]   And are you convinced of who He is and are you convinced of who you are?
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.180]   Are you convinced of what He promised you, what He said to you?
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:25.320]   Because I believe this message should be called "Enough is Enough."
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.760]   You're like, "Well, what do you mean by that?"
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.120]   I mean, how much more does God need to do?
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.900]   How much more does He need to say?
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.780]   He has lifted you out of the miry clay.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.660]   You weren't bad, you were dead, and He breathed on you by the grace of Jesus Christ and brought
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.320]   you back to life again.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.660]   You are living eternal, spiritual life.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:55.220]   He didn't just give you a pat on the back, He changed you from sinful to holy and gave
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.320]   you the gift of His righteousness so that we are robed right now in the righteousness
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.460]   of Christ and we have the mind of Christ and the word of Christ and the truth of Christ
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:10.460]   and we have the light of Christ for every single step.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.860]   He gave you a new name.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.220]   He called you by a new name.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:20.880]   He called you daughter of the King, daughter of God, daughter of Yahweh, daughter of Adonai.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:27.900]   He called you wanted and chosen and sought after and pursued and beautiful and precious
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.180]   and valuable and purposed and anointed.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:36.100]   He called you by a new name and He put you in a family.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:41.180]   You are not just some appendage over here in the kingdom, you have a seat at the table
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.700]   of Almighty God.
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.200]   You have an audience with the King.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:53.020]   You can go in at three in the morning and say anything you want to the God of the universe.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.020]   And He filled you with His Spirit so you didn't have to walk around going, "OK, I gotta pull
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.020]   this off."
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:03.180]   No, He said, "I wanna put in you a Spirit that can pull everything off."
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:08.380]   And He didn't tell you to try harder, He said, "Die to you because I'm gonna put someone
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.660]   better than you in you."
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:14.860]   His name is Jesus Christ and none of us can live the Christian life if you haven't figured
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.540]   that out yet, but Jesus can.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:22.960]   He's so good at it, they named it after Him.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:29.480]   How much more do you need God to do?
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:39.520]   He preserved you when evil came against you and when evil came from you.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.940]   In the pain of it all, in the brutal of it all, in the broken of it all, in the darkness
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:50.540]   of it all, He brought you through it all and the enemy said to you, "You will not survive,"
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.040]   but you did.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.760]   The enemy said, "You will not make it," but you did.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.980]   The enemy said, "You will not live, you will die," but you didn't die and you're living
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.420]   now.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.060]   And He's giving you breath.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:16.660]   The Word says He gives all things life and breath and everything else.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:31.460]   And He's promised you that He can't be thwarted if you put your life in His hands.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:40.180]   And heaven forbid that I'm gonna bring Taylor Swift into this talk.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:52.660]   But you're a part of a generation that needs to know that you have way more authority than
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.040]   you think you do.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.860]   If you're under authority, remember that story of Jesus and the centurion's servant?
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:10.460]   The servant was dying, but the centurion was a man of faith and he said ultimately through
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.620]   the messengers to Jesus, "You don't even have to come to my house, just say the Word."
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.500]   He said, "I'm a man under authority, I get authority and I know you've got authority,
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.900]   so all you have to do is say the Word and if you say the Word, my servant will be healed."
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.920]   And I don't know whether you're under authority tonight, but when you're under authority,
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.700]   you have authority.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.900]   And when you get under God's authority, you can take authority and you can tell the darkness
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.580]   not here.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:50.700]   And I, again, am not trying to read too far into this text, but a lot of us in this room
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:36:03.140]   right now have stuff hanging on our hand that we need to, in Jesus' name, shake off.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:10.680]   I'm not saying that we don't need help, friends, accountability, counseling, mentorship, process,
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:16.980]   healing, I'm not speaking against any of that, but I'm saying right here in this moment tonight,
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.960]   some of you have got authority to shake things off of your life in Jesus' name right here
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   and right now.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.740]   You don't need a process, you just need to wake up to the fact that this thing that came
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.900]   out of the fire is going back in the fire tonight, because I am on a mission, I am called
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:37.560]   by God, I am chosen and anointed by God, and I have authority in the name of the one whose
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   authority I'm under tonight.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:47.840]   And I'm telling you, dread, get off of me.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:55.640]   In Jesus' name, get off of me.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:03.540]   All these crazy desires of the flesh, get off of me.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.320]   And I think the mentality sometimes that we have is, "Oh my gosh, a viper has come out
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   of the fire.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.320]   Can I see this?
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.680]   Is everybody looking at this?
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.840]   Do you realize what has happened to me?
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.140]   Did you understand how grave of a situation I'm in right now?"
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.240]   And Paul didn't have a second thought.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.320]   He was like, "Well, heck, that's not great.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.600]   Wham, and now the viper is in the fire.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:34.480]   I don't know if it squirmed out and through the people or if it just instantly got landed
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.920]   in the wrong, wrong spot and just crinkled up and died."
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.720]   But Paul didn't have time for it.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.280]   He got a message from God, "You're going to Rome.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.680]   You ain't dying on a fire in Malta.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.440]   You're not dying from a snake bite on a remote island in the Mediterranean.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.720]   You are going to appear before Caesar.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.440]   You're going to Rome."
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.960]   This is not Rome.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:17.340]   Get off.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:23.040]   Are you convinced of whose and who you are?
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:31.560]   And are you convinced of the power of the name that you bear?
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.280]   And is there something tonight that you can speak to?
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.800]   You don't need a pastor to take authority over it.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.760]   You need to take authority over it.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.160]   You don't need your small group to take authority for you.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.920]   You need to take authority.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.080]   You don't need another coffee.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.080]   You don't need two more lattes.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.160]   You need to take authority over it and say, "Get off of me."
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.880]   And you may need to say, "Get off of me" every hour for the next 45 days or 45 months, but
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:09.560]   you won't relent and you will stand in that authority and you will say, "Get off of me."
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.720]   Does anybody, I don't know if this is a fair question or not, have a tattoo?
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.400]   We're not going to do show and tell, by the way, just in case you were nervous about that.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.240]   Could you just hold your hands up again really high?
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.420]   I just like to see this because I'm trying to take a real quick snapshot.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.360]   And how many people do not have a tattoo of any kind?
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.360]   Can I see a show of hands?
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:33.120]   Oh man, there's a beat down on the no tattoos over the tattoos.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   Can I see the tattoo people just one more time?
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.520]   Keep your hand up.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.720]   TA has no tattoos, not even one that says the porch.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:49.080]   I thought you'd have the porch across your back, watermark on the front, breakaway down
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.840]   one leg.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   What's the dog's name?
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   Revelry.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.400]   Is that the dog's name?
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.560]   Why do I think that's the dog's name?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.320]   Is that the dog's name?
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   Close enough.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Reveley.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   Isn't that what I said?
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   Okay.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.320]   Reveley.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   Sorry.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   Reveley.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   Reveley.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   Anyway.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   Thank you.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.480]   Some of you still have your hand up.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   I appreciate that.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480]   I respect it.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.520]   That is a proud tattooed man right there.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.120]   He is still hanging in there.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.560]   If you had, could you put them up one more time?
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.400]   I'm closing right here.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.600]   If you're happy about your tattoo still, could you keep it up?
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.480]   Because I need to know, because I know some people will be like, yeah, went with Marie
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.280]   and I shouldn't have done that.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280]   Okay.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.880]   You can put them down now.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:45.880]   When you get a tattoo, either two things have happened, three things have happened.
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.800]   Either one, you've been incredibly pressured by the people around you.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.080]   Like we're all getting it.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.320]   We're never coming back to Malta, so we're getting a tattoo while we're here.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   All of us.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.080]   All right.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:09.760]   Or you were intoxicated and found out about the tattoo a little bit later after it was
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.880]   done.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:20.200]   Or you were as convinced as a human being can be.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.000]   And you said, put it on there.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.440]   It ain't coming off.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.320]   I'm not going to second guess it.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.840]   It's going to be there on my wedding day.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.840]   It's going to be there.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.840]   Oh man, that is terrible.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.520]   I had blood taken yesterday.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   That is awful.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.080]   I just saw that.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.480]   Oh my word.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:50.360]   And the snake, when it came out, it got me like right there.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:58.280]   It's going to be there when you're 70.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:04.800]   You were convinced.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:18.640]   And I want to pray the spirit TA of the tattoo right now, that the Holy Spirit will write
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:29.920]   on somebody with indelible ink that cannot be removed.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:39.120]   And you will leave this room and you will say, I am convinced.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.440]   Put it on my arm.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.000]   I want it on my neck.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.720]   I want to be a raging believer in the faith of God.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:54.240]   Right here on my neck.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.760]   I want to scare people before I lead them to the Lord.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.840]   Get it right here.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.960]   And I pray that God would do that.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.720]   Because can I just say it one more time?
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.080]   Enough is enough.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.040]   He can't save you anymore.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.400]   He cannot raise you any higher.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:27.720]   He cannot seat you at any more grand of a seat.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:34.400]   He cannot give you any more of Himself.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:51.040]   And He can't call you new any more than the new He has already called you.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:59.600]   So let's stop waiting for the angel in the night.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:12.720]   And let's rise up in the authority that is Jesus.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:21.640]   I want to pray over anybody at any location who doesn't just feel a little stirring tonight
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:26.560]   but you feel a tattoo tonight.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:34.520]   A very specific word of God coming on to you.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.640]   And you know when you wake up in the morning, it's still going to be there.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.960]   Because it didn't come from some preacher.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   It didn't come from somebody.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:56.400]   God spoke it into and onto you.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:11.720]   And it's time to shake it off and let God write something new on you.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:16.440]   God give us grace tonight to just trust you.
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:24.680]   If that's you tonight, I just invite you to stand wherever you are.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.080]   I want to pray for you.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.640]   God's spoken something on me tonight.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:34.840]   There's a tattoo that came clearly from God on my life tonight and I'm receiving it, standing
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:46.240]   in it, believing it, agreeing with it.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:54.360]   Maybe in Midland or Atlanta or some other live location.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:46:01.760]   Beautiful.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   Anybody else?
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:08.160]   I just want to stand into the truth that God is speaking to me tonight.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:18.080]   And where I have felt weak and unempowered, I sense that God is giving me the power that
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:26.640]   I need to trust what He's doing and saying is true over me.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:37.000]   My ship may go to the bottom of the sea but God still has a destination for me.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Anybody else before we pray?
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.680]   A few people are trickling up just as time goes by.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.680]   Anyone else?
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.680]   Thank you.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.680]   Thank you.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   Thank you.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.680]   Anybody else?
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.680]   Beautiful.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680]   Anybody way up in the top?
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.680]   Thank you.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.680]   Yeah, way up here.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   All across up there, thank you.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   Beautiful.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:14.120]   God, I just want to speak Jesus into every story, every situation, into every battle.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:22.280]   I speak Jesus.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   We speak Jesus.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:35.040]   I invite you if you're standing just to speak Jesus into whatever it is and receive what
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.920]   He's saying to you.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:43.040]   God, we speak the name that is power.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:59.400]   No hype, just belief that at the name of Jesus things move and change.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.720]   And I pray for my brothers and sisters.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:09.500]   We come around them in faith asking you to lift their faith tonight to believe what you
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:13.200]   are speaking to them.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:21.640]   God indelibly mark us tonight with words of truth.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:28.200]   This is our prayer and this is our hope in the mighty name that is above all names.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.800]   In the name of Jesus, this is our hope and prayer.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
