 [music]

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:26,020
 [cheers]

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,020
 >> PORCH, how we doing?

5
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,020
 Hey, hey.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,020
 So amazing just to be with you guys.

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:42,020
 PORCH Live locations, Boise, Scottsdale, Indianapolis, Fort

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,020
 Worth, all over the place.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,020
 God is moving on the move through the lives of young

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,020
 adults.

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,020
 If we haven't met, my name is JP, Jonathan Bercuda.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,020
 It's a privilege to serve with you tonight.

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,020
 I spent a lot of time in this place and just have a really

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,020
 special place in my heart.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,020
 Josiah said today, hey, welcome home.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,020
 And I feel that.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,020
 I feel like I'm visiting home.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,020
 I'm going to start by sharing a prayer that Sam sent me today.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,020
 He said, JP, I'm praying for tonight.

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,020
 I sense the spirit giving me a prayer to pray that I'm excited

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,020
 about.

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,020
 I'm praying that pastors would be born tonight.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,020
 That there would be someone sitting up top in the back hung

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,020
 over and in shame for the decisions he or she has made in

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
 life.

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,020
 But who could be set free tonight and become a mouthpiece

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
 for God.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,020
 I'm asking that your kind would be multiplied not for your glory

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,020
 but for God's and for the good of his kingdom.

30
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,020
 May you rightly handle the word of truth and God, use your

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,020
 faithfulness to set apart new vessels as holy and ready for

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,020
 the master's work.

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,020
 And I just responded, what a perfect prayer.

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,020
 And that's what excites me about these moments right here.

35
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,020
 Because there's some of you here for the wrong reasons.

36
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,020
 There's some of you here on a dare.

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,020
 There's some of you, you know, a friend said, hey, come with me

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
 to the porch.

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,020
 And you're like, oh, the restaurant or the bar.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,020
 And then they turn into a church.

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,020
 You're like, wait, what are we doing here?

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,020
 And I'm glad you're here, man.

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,020
 I was you.

44
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
 That's the reality.

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
 That's the truth.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,020
 I was you.

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,020
 And so, Lord, I do just pray you do a work.

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,020
 Open our hearts for whatever it is that you want to do.

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,020
 I pray that you would keep us safe, that you would remove any

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
 and all distractions from our lives and that you would just

51
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,020
 bring us to a place where we see your word front and center and

52
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,020
 that it's sharper than a two-edged sword, that it would

53
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,020
 penetrate both bone and marrow in our hearts and change us from

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
 the inside out.

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,020
 In the name of Jesus, amen.

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,020
 Hey, everybody has special, like, different gifts.

57
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,020
 You know, I don't know what your gifts are.

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,020
 Some of you can run fast.

59
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,020
 You're good at math.

60
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,020
 You know, everyone is dealt gifts.

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,020
 A gift as God was distributing them that I did not receive was

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
 a good sense of direction, okay?

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
 Like, I get lost in my neighborhood.

64
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
 I'm like, wait, hold on.

65
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,020
 You know, I'm like driving in circles.

66
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
 Have I seen that house?

67
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,020
 Somebody is like, that's your house.

68
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
 Oh, it's my house.

69
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,020
 Like, I get -- I'm just not -- I truly, like, I'll pull into a

70
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
 neighborhood.

71
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
 I don't know how to get out.

72
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
 Somebody is like, hey, which way is north?

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
 I'm like, I have no idea.

74
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,020
 I'm an early adopter of the GPS navigation system.

75
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,020
 Like, I got in that game early.

76
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,020
 You know, I don't go anywhere without putting it, you know, in

77
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,020
 Google Maps or Waze or if I don't want to get there, Apple

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
 Maps.

79
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,020
 And so, like, I'm big on the GPS.

80
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,020
 And recently I got a new car.

81
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,020
 Or it's a used car but new to me car, right?

82
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,020
 And so, like, when I'm purchasing a car, if I'm

83
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,020
 choosing, like, I put a navigation system high on the

84
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
 priority list.

85
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
 And so it has that.

86
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,020
 And I'm coming back, I'm flying back to DFW from Atlanta.

87
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,020
 And I don't know if you know this about our story but four

88
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,020
 years ago our family moved from this place, from this church and

89
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,020
 this ministry to Waco to be a part of a church there and

90
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,020
 continue God's mission in Waco.

91
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:27,020
 So I fly in from Atlanta to DFW and the new used car has one of

92
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,020
 these cool features where you can just hit home.

93
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,020
 Like, you can just push the home button and it tells you how to

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
 get there.

95
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,020
 And so I, like, pull, I'm ready to get home.

96
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,020
 I miss my kids.

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
 I miss my wife.

98
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
 I went by myself.

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,020
 I push the home button and DFW is, like, the most confusing

100
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,020
 place in the world.

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,020
 Like, north terminal, south terminal, I'm like, whatever.

102
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,020
 So I just do what it says.

103
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,020
 And all of a sudden, so it takes me out of, you know, DFW south

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,020
 exit but then it has me turn left toward Dallas which I've

105
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
 never done before.

106
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,020
 Like, usually you go kind of through Fort Worth to get to

107
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
 Waco from DFW.

108
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
 So I turn left.

109
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,020
 I'm like, this is weird but, like, maybe it senses traffic

110
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,020
 because it's smart like that.

111
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
 Like, it knows if there's some traffic.

112
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
 It knows somehow.

113
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
 I don't know how.

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
 But black magic.

115
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
 But somehow it knows.

116
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
 And so I'm like, all right.

117
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
 So I go left.

118
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
 I'm driving to Dallas.

119
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
 Oh, it's going to take me to Dallas, you know.

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
 But then it takes me all the way to Dallas.

121
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,020
 Then it takes me through Dallas.

122
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,020
 And I'm, like, moving toward Mesquite, you know, and whatnot.

123
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
 I'm like, this is a really weird way to get to Waco, you know.

124
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,020
 And then it has me turn north.

125
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,020
 And I'm like, wait a minute.

126
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,020
 You know, I know I'm not good at this, but I'm pretty sure Waco's south.

127
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,020
 And so I pull over.

128
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,020
 I just pull over on the side of the road.

129
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
 I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

130
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,020
 Well, somehow the navigation system in the car had reverted back to the

131
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,020
 original owner's address.

132
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,020
 Yeah, like reset or something at night.

133
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:05,020
 And so it was taking me to his house, which he evidently lives north of Dallas.

134
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,020
 And I tell you that, but because before I can follow that, before I can, you know,

135
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,020
 do what it tells me to do, to go where it tells me to go, I have to make sure that

136
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,020
 I input the right destination.

137
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,020
 And your heart works the same way.

138
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,020
 Your heart works the same way.

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,020
 Some of you have given advice to friends, well, just listen to your heart.

140
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,020
 You've asked questions, well, what is your heart telling you to do?

141
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,020
 You're like this, Selena Gomez, you know, the heart wants what it wants.

142
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,020
 No, the heart wants what it's fed.

143
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,020
 Before you can follow your heart, you have to make sure that it is set on the

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,020
 right destination.

145
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,020
 I just finished a literary work.

146
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
 It is actually released today.

147
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,020
 And it asked the question in the title, why do I do what I don't want to do?

148
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,020
 And I want to answer the question so you don't even need to buy it.

149
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,020
 I'm just going to give you the punchline because you have sin hidden in your heart.

150
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,020
 That's why you do what you don't want to do.

151
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,020
 And the scripture doesn't say to follow your heart.

152
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,020
 It actually says to guard your heart.

153
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,020
 And if you've been in church long, you probably have heard someone like me

154
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,020
 stand on a stage like this and say, guard your heart.

155
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
 You know, it's like the 15-year-old lock-in.

156
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,020
 Maybe you grew up in church and there was the overnight and there's some

157
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,020
 pastor saying, guard your heart.

158
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,020
 And every 15-year-old girl is like, yes, I'm going to, but what does it mean?

159
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,020
 And so I'm going to tell you because the scripture tells us exactly what it means.

160
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,020
 And the verse isn't written for a 15-year-old girl at a lock-in.

161
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,020
 It's written for all of us who want more from our faith.

162
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,020
 Maybe you sit down at a quiet time and it feels like a punishment.

163
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,020
 Maybe you're trying to pray but you're distracted.

164
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
 Maybe you read the Bible and it doesn't make sense.

165
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,020
 Maybe like a dog to his vomit, you keep going back to the same things that seek

166
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,020
 to take you out.

167
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,020
 And I'm telling you, there is a solution.

168
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,020
 And if you lean in and as we open the word and we see what it says, I think you

169
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,020
 might find something in it that will actually set you free.

170
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,020
 That there is a way that you can leave here tonight and actually guard your

171
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:41,020
 heart in a way consistent with what the scriptures call you to.

172
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,020
 Even the Bible can be confusing on the issue because if you've been in church

173
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
 long, you probably have thought about Jeremiah 17, 9.

174
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,020
 By now, the heart is wicked and deceitful and beyond cure.

175
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
 Who can trust it?

176
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
 Who can know it?

177
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,020
 Maybe you know that verse.

178
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,020
 But that's half the story because there's also Romans 5.

179
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,020
 "But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to

180
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,020
 obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your

181
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,020
 allegiance."

182
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:17,020
 So I asked a theologian friend, "Is the regenerate heart trustworthy?"

183
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,020
 The regenerate heart is just a theological term for the new heart,

184
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,020
 the spirit-filled heart.

185
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:34,020
 And they said, "Yes, but the degenerate heart, the fallen heart, the flesh, is

186
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,020
 never dead as long as we're on this earth."

187
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,020
 So you always have this sin nature at war with God's desires for you and that's

188
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,020
 why Paul says, "The good I want to do, I don't do, but the evil I don't want to

189
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,020
 do, this I keep on doing."

190
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,020
 Then I know you've been there.

191
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
 I don't want to click that hashtag.

192
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,020
 I don't want to go back to that porn site.

193
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,020
 I don't want to call that boyfriend that knows no good for me.

194
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,020
 I don't want to drink too much and I don't want to hang with them and I don't

195
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:08,020
 want to watch that show again, but I keep finding myself in this place where I'm

196
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,020
 doing the things I don't want to do.

197
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,020
 What does it mean to guard our heart?

198
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,020
 Read Proverbs chapter 4 if you'll turn there with me.

199
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,020
 It's right in the middle of the Scripture in the Old Testament.

200
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,020
 It's the book of Proverbs.

201
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,020
 Move toward the center of your Bible.

202
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,020
 The first nine chapters of Proverbs is really made up of 10 lectures and it's

203
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:44,020
 really a father speaking to his son, mostly written by King Solomon.

204
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
 Certainly this part is.

205
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,020
 He's known as the wisest man who has ever lived other than Jesus.

206
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,020
 He penned these words thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago so

207
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,020
 that we can open this book called the book of wisdom and apply it to our lives

208
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,020
 tonight and still in 2023 glean wisdom from it.

209
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,020
 It's actually pretty amazing.

210
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,020
 I'll read the whole thing and then we'll kind of break it down and figure out

211
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:15,020
 how to guard our heart.

212
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,020
 My son, pay attention to what I say.

213
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,020
 Turn your ear to my words.

214
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,020
 He's like, hey, may I have your attention.

215
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
 That worked really well, man.

216
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
 You guys were ready for the clap.

217
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,020
 Oh, wait, hold on.

218
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
 Do not let them out of your sight.

219
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
 Keep them within your heart.

220
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,020
 He's about to say, he's about to warn us about what we let in our heart but he

221
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
 says, hey, this is what I'm about to tell you.

222
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
 I want you to open your heart to this.

223
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,020
 Make sure you let this in your heart.

224
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,020
 For they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.

225
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
 The stakes are high.

226
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,020
 It's life and death.

227
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,020
 We talk a lot about mental health right now.

228
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
 You want mental health.

229
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:57,020
 He's like, I'm going to tell you a way that you can have or find or keep good

230
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,020
 mental health.

231
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:08,020
 Above all else, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it.

232
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,020
 Your version might say, keep your heart with all diligence.

233
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:18,020
 The word keep there is like the milk keeps, like keep the food from spoiling.

234
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,020
 He's saying, hey, your heart, it can turn rotten.

235
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:25,020
 Anybody know anyone with a rotten heart?

236
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,020
 Anybody ever dated somebody with a rotten -- don't point.

237
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,020
 Don't elbow.

238
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,020
 Not the time for that.

239
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,020
 But, yeah, your heart, it can spoil.

240
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,020
 Keep your mouth free from perversity.

241
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,020
 He's telling us how.

242
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,020
 Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.

243
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
 Let your eyes look straight ahead.

244
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
 Fix your gaze directly before you.

245
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,020
 Give careful thought to the past before your feet and be steadfast in all your

246
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
 ways.

247
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,020
 Do not turn to the right or the left.

248
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,020
 Keep your foot from evil.

249
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,020
 Three key observations from this text.

250
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,020
 Number one, your heart stores information.

251
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,020
 It's like a storage container.

252
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
 You put stuff there.

253
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,020
 Number two, the stuff that you put in your heart determines where you go.

254
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,020
 Everything from your life flows from it.

255
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,020
 And number three, he calls you to guard it more than you guard anything, which I

256
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
 don't want you to sleep on that.

257
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,020
 Like, that's important instruction.

258
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,020
 And so, the first question is, what does it mean to guard your heart?

259
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,020
 What does it mean to guard your heart?

260
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:35,020
 It means to be very careful what you let in.

261
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,020
 It's a military term, actually.

262
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,020
 Like a soldier, like an armed guard who, when someone tries to breach the castle

263
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:51,020
 with violence and hostility, he takes them down.

264
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,020
 Above all else, more than you guard your stereo, more than you guard your

265
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 apartment, more than you guard your house, more than you guard your money with

266
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:07,020
 FDIC insurance or whatever it is you put it in a bank and in a vault, more than

267
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:14,020
 you guard your emails or your computers, password protections.

268
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,020
 When you guard anything, guard your heart.

269
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,020
 For everything you do flows from it.

270
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:27,020
 It's going to determine what comes out of your life.

271
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,020
 But how do we guard our heart?

272
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,020
 How do we do it?

273
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,020
 You take in things through your five senses.

274
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,020
 You guys remember this from health class?

275
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,020
 See, hear, smell, taste, touch.

276
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,020
 You take in things.

277
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,020
 This represents your five senses.

278
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:53,020
 So, as you experience things, it takes what you're experiencing out here into

279
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
 your brain, into your mind.

280
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,020
 Because as we talk about the heart, I want you to know we're not talking about

281
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
 the physical organ.

282
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
 We're not talking about the thing beating in your chest.

283
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,020
 In the scripture where you see the heart, it's like the word we say, the gut,

284
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,020
 your spirit.

285
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,020
 Like the thing inside you where you keep stuff.

286
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,020
 And there's a difference between your mind and your heart.

287
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,020
 Your mind is what you think.

288
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,020
 Your heart is what you feel.

289
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
 Your mind is what you think.

290
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,020
 Your heart is what you feel.

291
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,020
 So, as you take in things from your five senses, right, they go into your mind.

292
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
 You store them in your mind.

293
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
 And you know this.

294
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
 Like you, "Oh, man, my mom."

295
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
 You have that nostalgia, that familiarity.

296
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,020
 "Oh, man, my mom used to make this lasagna.

297
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
 Oh, I smell this place.

298
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,020
 I remember going here when I was a kid.

299
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,020
 Oh, I danced to this in eighth grade.

300
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
 Call me, maybe."

301
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,020
 You know, it's like -- and it's like all of a sudden I'm back there,

302
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
 and all the insecurities are flooding.

303
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
 Baby, bye-bye, bye."

304
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,020
 Whatever it is, right, you hear it, and it just takes just like a time warp,

305
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,020
 back in time, because you experience it out here, and it comes in here.

306
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,020
 And your brain, your brain then feeds your heart.

307
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 And it takes those things that you think, and it stores them

308
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,020
 where you keep your emotions in your heart.

309
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,020
 And then what you put in your heart determines where you go.

310
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,020
 Everything in your life flows from it.

311
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,020
 Okay?

312
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,020
 I was driving here, and I was stressed.

313
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
 I'm like, "Why am I stressed?"

314
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,020
 You know, I had a rushed, quiet time this morning.

315
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
 We had staff prayer.

316
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
 You know, I'm pounding coffee.

317
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,020
 Book release is today, and so like I'm watching it on Amazon.

318
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,020
 I want to know how it's doing, you know?

319
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,020
 And if I'm like in full transfer, I'm watching it too much.

320
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:51,020
 I'm filling my head too much with -- I'm trying to find significance in a ranking.

321
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
 You know?

322
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,020
 And then that feeds my heart.

323
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,020
 And then when I begin to find identity in how I'm doing,

324
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:03,020
 you can understand how many friends you have, if you have a significant other or not,

325
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
 your relationship status, how you're doing at work.

326
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,020
 If you ever checked -- I don't know if you've ever checked your bank account,

327
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,020
 but you're like, "Oh, okay, it's still there," you know, or you're just trying to --

328
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,020
 it's a bit irrelevant today -- just trying to understand like, "Hey, do I have --"

329
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,020
 I don't know if you -- you probably don't struggle with that,

330
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 but you're just trying to say, "What is my safety blanket?

331
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
 What can I grab control over?"

332
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,020
 And the Scripture says that you're -- have you ever been to a club where there's like a bouncer, you know,

333
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
 and he's like choosing -- you ever been to one of these places, you know,

334
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,020
 where they're like choosing who they let -- like, "Hey, you -- no, with the flip-flops, you can't come in, no.

335
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,020
 But you, oh, yeah, with the cute bag, come on, you know, come to the front."

336
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,020
 You ever seen this? You guys ever seen this?

337
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,020
 You guys are like, "I'm in church." "No, I've never -- I don't know what you're talking about, pastor."

338
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,020
 "Oh, okay, well, there are these things called clubs, and they have people called bouncers,

339
00:17:52,020 --> 00:18:00,020
 and this Scripture is saying, 'Hey, you got to be the bouncer of what you let in your heart.

340
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,020
 You got to check IDs, man, okay?

341
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,020
 You got to make sure that it is of God, because if it's not of God,

342
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,020
 it's not going to take you to godly places.

343
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,020
 You just think it's that simple."

344
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,020
 And you're like, "Well, that's too simple."

345
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:25,020
 No, it's that simple. It's real. It's true.

346
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,020
 And you can not just let -- keep bad things out, you can let good things in.

347
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,020
 Up until about 10 to 20 years ago, if you went to a therapist, and you said,

348
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,020
 "Mr. Therapist, I am really struggling with some severe anxiety," right?

349
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,020
 That therapist is going to prescribe for you, if they can,

350
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,020
 or they're going to send you to a doctor so that you can leave with what's called an SSRI,

351
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,020
 a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.

352
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,020
 Okay, this is medication. Some of you know this. Some of you are on it. You've been on it.

353
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,020
 Nothing wrong with medication. That's not what I'm saying.

354
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,020
 And in fact, sometimes it's really necessary so that you can actually get to a place where you can apply therapy.

355
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,020
 But today, you go to a therapist, and you say, "I'm really struggling with anxiety,"

356
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:14,020
 more than likely, even if they are an atheist scientist doctor,

357
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:21,020
 you're going to leave with an assignment that looks something like prayer.

358
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,020
 It's called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

359
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:31,020
 And they're going to say, "Hey, I want you to start every day in deep contemplative thought.

360
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,020
 I want you to sit still. I want you to meditate."

361
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,020
 And it's like our science is catching up with the Bible, where David says,

362
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,020
 "I meditate on your law day and night. Set your mind on the things above.

363
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,020
 Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."

364
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:53,020
 Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable,

365
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,020
 if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about these things.

366
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,020
 These are thousands of year old texts that our science is all of a sudden saying,

367
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,020
 "Hey, there's something on to this stuff."

368
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,020
 It actually helps people.

369
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
 But how do we guard our heart?

370
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,020
 Let me give you five questions.

371
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
 Who, what, where, when, why?

372
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,020
 They're who, what, where, when, why questions.

373
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,020
 This is a note taker sermon from here.

374
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,020
 You're going to want to get a pen or your phone or something, throw it on airplane mode.

375
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,020
 You're probably going to want to take notes here because it's going to feel like you're drinking from a fire hydrant

376
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,020
 as I wrap up and give you these five questions.

377
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,020
 How do we guard our heart?

378
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,020
 Number one, who are you listening to?

379
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,020
 It says in verse 20, who are you listening to?

380
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
 "My son, pay attention to what I say.

381
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,020
 Turn your ear to my words.

382
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,020
 Do not let them out of your sight.

383
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,020
 Keep them within your heart."

384
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
 Who are you listening to?

385
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,020
 Because we all have feedback bias and when we really, really want something,

386
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,020
 we want to find a group of people that will say, "It's okay for you to want that.

387
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
 It's okay for you to date him.

388
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
 It's okay for you to watch that.

389
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
 It's okay for you to go there.

390
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
 It's okay for you to buy that."

391
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,020
 We want to surround ourselves with people who agree with us.

392
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,020
 Who are you listening to, but not just community.

393
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,020
 Like, what are you putting in your head through your ears?

394
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
 Because I have this conversation all the time.

395
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,020
 In fact, I've had it for 12 years.

396
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,020
 12 years, right here.

397
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,020
 Look, right here, I had a conversation right here for 12 years.

398
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,020
 People come up afterwards, "Hey, JP, young woman."

399
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,020
 Man, I just like, "Here's the problem.

400
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
 You know, I just only date losers.

401
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
 I don't know what it is.

402
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,020
 I'm just attracted to losers.

403
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
 It's just like they're like my type.

404
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,020
 I don't know, like Enneagram loser.

405
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,020
 That's what I want."

406
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
 And I'll go, "Oh, okay.

407
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,020
 I got you.

408
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,020
 I got you.

409
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 Hey, what are you listening to?

410
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
 What do you mean what am I listening to?"

411
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,020
 I'm like, "Oh, man, what's your favorite songs right now?"

412
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
 "No, but I'm talking about dating."

413
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,020
 "I know, just humor me for a minute.

414
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,020
 What's your favorite songs right now?"

415
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
 "Oh, I don't know.

416
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
 I mean, that new T-Swift album, you heard that?

417
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,020
 Antihero.

418
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,020
 I mean, it jams.

419
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
 It goes hard."

420
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,020
 "Oh, cool.

421
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
 So you want a relationship like Taylor?"

422
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
 "Who else?

423
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
 Who else are you listening to?"

424
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,020
 "I mean, I don't know, you know, Miley Cyrus."

425
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
 "I can buy myself flowers."

426
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,020
 "You're going to be."

427
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
 "I'm not going to be."

428
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
 "You're going to be."

429
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,020
 "I'm not going to be."

430
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
 "You're going to be."

431
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
 "I'm not going to be."

432
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
 "I'm not going to be."

433
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 "I'm not going to be."

434
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,020
 "I'm not going to be."

435
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,380
 "You're going to be.

436
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,320
 You're going to have to because you keep dating losers, right?

437
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,220
 You know she just went through a divorce with a dude who cheated on her 14 times in the

438
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,920
 house that she made that music video in.

439
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,540
 Did you know that?

440
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,500
 You're going to have to buy yourself flowers unless you start listening to something else."

441
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,420
 "Oh, you thought Doja Cat wasn't going to take you?"

442
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,380
 "Oh, you, I mean, for real, like Post Malone was going to make you love God more.

443
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,740
 That's what you thought.

444
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,780
 That's really where we were thinking, like, oh no, but it's innocent.

445
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,260
 It's just music.

446
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,020
 Like what's the big deal?"

447
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,420
 "You thought Nicki Minaj wasn't going to hurt your relationship with Jesus.

448
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,340
 Lil Uzi wasn't going to like take you out of intimacy with Christ."

449
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,220
 "No, for sure."

450
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,620
 "You sound like my grandma."

451
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,780
 "No, I sound like the wisest man that ever lived other than Jesus.

452
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,500
 It's what he said."

453
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,420
 "Man, what's wrong with the world because everybody seems so anxious and depressed and,

454
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,860
 you know, porn and marriage rates are down and divorce rates are up.

455
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
 What's wrong with the world?"

456
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,580
 "What's wrong with our music?

457
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
 What you listening to?"

458
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,460
 "But you sure I got to guard it that much?"

459
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,940
 "Above everything else.

460
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
 Above all else."

461
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,260
 Man, when I go to quiet time, God just feels so far.

462
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,260
 It's in your heart.

463
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
 It's not just songs.

464
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,780
 I mean, listen to gossip.

465
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,120
 For some of us it's sports.

466
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,500
 We start to care too much about, you know, teams and basketballs or footballs or whatever.

467
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,420
 It just can dominate.

468
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,060
 Number two, what are you saying?

469
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,580
 Keep your mouth free of perversity.

470
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,580
 Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.

471
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,900
 What are you saying?

472
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,780
 What's coming out of your mouth?

473
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,420
 You say, "Does what we say really impact our heart?"

474
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,220
 Maybe more than anything else.

475
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,500
 At least, listen to me, at least it will show you what's actually in your heart.

476
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:53,300
 And this is really important if you're considering dating someone because you were like, "Well,

477
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,380
 how do I know if what's in their heart is good?

478
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,380
 What comes out of their mouth?"

479
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,620
 And we go to the words of Jesus if it's helpful, Matthew 15.

480
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,740
 "But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile

481
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
 them.

482
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,540
 For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft,

483
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,340
 false testimony, and slander, and these are what defile a person."

484
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,900
 I really like him, JP, but sometimes he'll say some things.

485
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,380
 It's not gonna go well.

486
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,420
 You think your cussing problem's cute.

487
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,220
 No, your heart's not cute.

488
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
 It's messed up.

489
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,580
 And if it feels like legalism, the solution is not to leave here and try to stop.

490
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,180
 The solution is A, know Jesus.

491
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,820
 Understand who He is and what He's done for you.

492
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,420
 And when you do, you have His Holy Spirit, and if you do know who Jesus is and what He's

493
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,740
 done for you, you surrender to that Spirit, the Spirit of God, the same Spirit that raised

494
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,860
 Christ from the dead.

495
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,460
 He can help you stop cussing.

496
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,540
 He can help you with your porn problem.

497
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:11,220
 He can help you with your gossip issue.

498
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,700
 What's coming out of your mouth?

499
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,020
 Number three, where are you looking?

500
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,620
 Third question, where are you looking?

501
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,340
 It says in verse 25, "Let your eyes look straight ahead.

502
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:33,380
 Fix your gaze directly before you."

503
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,620
 Where are you looking?

504
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
 Social media is so smart.

505
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:42,020
 Like the way they do that, like you like just scroll over something slow.

506
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,500
 And they're like, "Oh, you like that?

507
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 How about this?"

508
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:51,620
 You know, I used to be like into, I loved like MMA, martial arts and stuff.

509
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,740
 And I, yeah, I'm not into it anymore, but I still like a sucker for a good like knockout

510
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
 video.

511
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,620
 I know that makes, I know I'm a terrible person, but, but I, and it's somehow Instagram has

512
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,620
 learned this because that explore page is dangerous.

513
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,620
 You know, you, you know, amen, explore page dangerous.

514
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,660
 And you're there and there's just like somebody gets knocked out.

515
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,340
 I'm like, "Oh my goodness.

516
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
 Wow."

517
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,180
 And I can't watch, but let me watch it again.

518
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
 You know?

519
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:23,300
 And, and, and if I do, there's like, it's like places some violence in my heart.

520
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,940
 You know, it's like somebody will come up afterwards like, "Hey, that sermon was terrible,

521
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
 man."

522
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,940
 I'm like, "I bet if I hit you right."

523
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,940
 No, I'm just kidding.

524
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
 I'm just joking.

525
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,300
 There's a lot of judgment right there.

526
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,500
 I was, that was a joke.

527
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,020
 I'm just kidding, man.

528
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,780
 I'm just joking.

529
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,220
 Your heart, man.

530
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,060
 It works like TikTok.

531
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
 You know what I mean?

532
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,780
 It's like, "Oh, you like that video?

533
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,780
 What about this video?

534
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
 What about this video?

535
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
 What about this video?

536
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,620
 Oh, you like, or maybe you're like, "Oh, we're not on TikTok.

537
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
 We're Christian."

538
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,540
 Netflix.

539
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,020
 It works like Netflix.

540
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,940
 "Oh, you like The Office?

541
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,020
 How about Suits?

542
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,980
 How about this sitcom?

543
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,140
 What about this one and this one?

544
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
 Oh, you like that one?

545
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
 What about this one?"

546
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,260
 And it just starts to feed you more of what you feed it.

547
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,020
 It's like a bloodhound.

548
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,540
 You put it on a scent and it's like, "All right, where are we going to go next?"

549
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
 You know?

550
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,820
 So, what are you looking at?

551
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,900
 What are you watching?

552
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,140
 Because it's going to feed you more of what you look at.

553
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,260
 This is the lie of one last time.

554
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,620
 It's like, "I'm never going to look at porn again.

555
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
 This is the last time."

556
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,020
 No, you just fed something and it just grew.

557
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,220
 And that appetite is stronger.

558
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,800
 And the next time is going to be more difficult than that time because you fed it.

559
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,940
 You looked at it again.

560
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,500
 That's why you're stuck.

561
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,220
 That's why you can't get well.

562
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,700
 You keep eating the monster.

563
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,000
 You keep poisoning your heart.

564
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,060
 You keep going back and looking at that.

565
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:00,420
 Like right now, like these crime shows are, you know, true crime, snapped, right?

566
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:07,460
 Whatever, whatever, you're the one that you're watching, you know, the murders, serial podcast,

567
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,940
 Dateline NBC, Forensic Files.

568
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,340
 There's like an obsession with this.

569
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,780
 And I was watching one the other day.

570
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,660
 I was at my in-laws and it was on TV and I'm watching it.

571
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
 And it gets me sucked in.

572
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
 I'm like, "Oh, okay.

573
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
 What happened?

574
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
 Oh, my goodness.

575
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,660
 When?

576
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,660
 And they didn't know.

577
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,660
 And how did they not know?

578
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
 And where are the murder weapons in the tank?

579
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
 What?"

580
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:28,780
 And I'm watching this and I'm just like feeling like my heart like grow for this.

581
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,340
 And it goes and it talks about the murder and it says how much they were obsessed with

582
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,100
 these crime shows.

583
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,060
 And then it says they went from watching their, you know, their crime shows, their murder

584
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,900
 shows to committing murder themselves, to making their own.

585
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,380
 And I was like, "Wait, is that going to happen to me?"

586
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,460
 You know, I don't want to kill anybody.

587
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
 You know, it's like, "Wait, hold on.

588
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,460
 Why am I going to feed my heart that then?

589
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,980
 Why am I going to feed my heart that?"

590
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,180
 It's like your iPhone.

591
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,740
 It's always listening, you know.

592
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
 You know how your iPhone works?

593
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,420
 You're like, "I need to buy a new rug."

594
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,580
 And it's like, "Oh, you want a rug?

595
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,900
 Check out Overstock has rugs.

596
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
 Amazon has rugs.

597
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,660
 Rooms to Go has rugs.

598
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,660
 Rugs are us."

599
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,700
 You know, everywhere you look, there's like, I mean, there's like rugs everywhere, you

600
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,860
 know.

601
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,220
 It's always listening.

602
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
 It's always listening.

603
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,260
 You watch these shows, you know.

604
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,820
 Summer I Turned Pretty, you know.

605
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,180
 Is that what it's called?

606
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
 How do you know?

607
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
 See?

608
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,180
 Watch it.

609
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,180
 Right?

610
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,100
 It's like in Waco, there's a show in Waco called Fixer Upper.

611
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,020
 Yeah, man, I love that stuff.

612
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,540
 It's like the best thing on TV.

613
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,920
 Chip and Joe.

614
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,700
 And I'll watch it.

615
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,860
 And I'm like, "Babe, we need a new house."

616
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,780
 And she's like, in real talk, she's like, "We just got a new house."

617
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,620
 And I'm like, "No, we need an old house that we can make new."

618
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,580
 She's like, "But we just built a new house."

619
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,820
 And I was like, "I know, but I wish we would have bought an old house that we could, you

620
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,460
 know, make new again."

621
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,380
 And she's like, "Something, it's weird how your desires grow when you feed them like

622
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,500
 that.

623
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,100
 The pure in heart will set no evil thing before their eyes."

624
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,180
 Number four, when do you plan your path?

625
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,620
 When do you plan your path?

626
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:41,140
 Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.

627
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,700
 Give careful thought to your path.

628
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,220
 Guys, you're not gonna grow in your relationship with Jesus if you don't set a time aside for

629
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,540
 Him every day.

630
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,860
 I was talking to a friend the other day and he was talking about his own anxiety and depression.

631
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,340
 And he said, "Prayer healed me."

632
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,500
 And I said, "Oh, like you prayed for healing and got niggas?"

633
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
 "No, no, no, no.

634
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,800
 Like the activity of prayer actually cleaned my mind."

635
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,940
 And he was telling me about this and I was kind of thinking about my own experience with

636
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,620
 anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy.

637
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,140
 And I was like, "Oh, I see how that can happen.

638
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,140
 I'm not saying, I'm not trying to put a bandaid on your, you know, gaping wound.

639
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,220
 I'm not saying, 'Hey, just pray it away.'

640
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:31,760
 I am saying that there's something to this setting a time aside to plan our path.

641
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,680
 And if you're not doing that, like today's the time to start.

642
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,640
 And you just put it on your calendar just like anything else that's important to you

643
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,860
 and just prioritize it from there.

644
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,020
 And number five, why do you stray?

645
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,260
 Why do you stray?

646
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,340
 That's like asking how would the enemy take you out?

647
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,360
 He says in verse 27, "Do not turn to the right or the left.

648
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,500
 Keep your foot from evil."

649
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,460
 If something is evil, don't touch it.

650
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,580
 Don't poke it.

651
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,940
 Don't sniff it.

652
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,980
 Don't get near it.

653
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,820
 And it's interesting to me how your peers think, "Oh, you know, it's just like a little

654
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,820
 manifesting.

655
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,100
 You know, it's not really prayer.

656
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
 It's manifesting.

657
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
 Oh, it's satanic.

658
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
 It's demonic.

659
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,140
 What you're doing is of the devil."

660
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
 Well, it's just crystals.

661
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,700
 It's just a rock.

662
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,060
 It's like, no, it's a rock with demonic power is what it is.

663
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,060
 You're playing with evil things.

664
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,380
 Don't do it.

665
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,900
 Don't get close to it.

666
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,420
 Because when you do what you do with the scripture, it literally says is you give the devil a

667
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
 foothold.

668
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,060
 If you've ever been like climbing, it's like you just give him in your life, in your heart,

669
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,900
 you said, "Hey, put your foot here.

670
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
 Hang out here.

671
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
 Come around.

672
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,460
 Stick with me.

673
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
 Let's be buds."

674
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,260
 You give him a foothold.

675
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:57,020
 Like for me, like my history is an addiction to pornography, sexual addiction.

676
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
 It owned me.

677
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,020
 It devoured me.

678
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,820
 And so I got to be really careful what I watch.

679
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,660
 And there's a kind of show I love where it's like that you have this kind of moral hero,

680
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:16,260
 this person that it has like a real sense of justice, but they're also very skilled

681
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,060
 in like martial arts or, you know, think like born identity, born supremacy.

682
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,300
 And so we're talking through this and my buddy's like, "Oh, you should see, you know, talk

683
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,860
 about Jack Ryan or, you know, Terminalist."

684
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,100
 He's like, "You should watch Reacher.

685
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
 You should watch Reacher."

686
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,540
 And man, he's like, "It's right up here."

687
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
 I was like, "Oh man, it is.

688
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,540
 I'm watching Reacher."

689
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,260
 I'm like, "This is so good.

690
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
 I love it."

691
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,060
 And now here's what it's like, because the scripture says, you know, the enemy is the

692
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
 devil.

693
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,220
 And so what I feel like my relationship with lust is like, it's like the devil is, he says,

694
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,700
 "The enemy of your devil is a lion."

695
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,620
 It's like there's a lion on the other side of this door and it's like, I got the door

696
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,220
 locked, padlocked, put a big bar in front of it.

697
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,060
 And I just like sit here with my back against that door all the time.

698
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,460
 I'm like, I'm not going to let the devil in, you know, right.

699
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,860
 And I'm watching Reacher.

700
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,860
 And all of a sudden like that, there's a shower scene.

701
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,300
 Like that, it's on the screen.

702
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
 I'm like, "Whoa, whoa."

703
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,180
 That's all it took though.

704
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:15,260
 What it's like in that moment, that moment, it's like I walk over to that door, unlock

705
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:21,340
 the padlock, move this, move the chain, take out the bar, turn the knob, crack it open,

706
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,140
 come and get me.

707
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:32,300
 And then everything that I see the next day, everywhere I look, it's just kind of contaminated.

708
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,060
 It's just poisoned.

709
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:44,780
 Because I fed my heart something that's not good for my heart.

710
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,620
 Why do you stray?

711
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:55,540
 The pure in heart eliminate evil from their lives at all costs.

712
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:01,020
 So be careful what you let in your heart by asking these questions.

713
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,940
 Who are you listening to?

714
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,620
 What are you saying?

715
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,980
 Where are you looking?

716
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,900
 When do you plan your path?

717
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,220
 And why do you stray?

718
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:23,440
 The absolute tragedy in this text is that the one who penned it, the one who wrote it

719
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,100
 did not follow his own advice.

720
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,140
 And it says that his heart was led astray.

721
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,180
 This is what it says in 1 Kings 11, talking about Solomon.

722
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,780
 It says, "As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his

723
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:43,180
 heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God as the heart of David his father has been."

724
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,100
 And we have an entire book in the Scriptures known as Ecclesiastes that shows us that

725
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,740
 King Solomon, the man who had more money than anyone who has ever lived before, his whole

726
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,900
 life is an experiment on wealth and the lust of pleasure.

727
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:06,540
 And it says that he died in deep depression and despair because his heart was turned away.

728
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,140
 This is where it went.

729
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,940
 Solomon is an awful God.

730
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:18,660
 Jesus, on the other hand, was tempted in every way that you've been tempted, but he did not

731
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,380
 sin.

732
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,020
 It says, "For the joy set before him, he endured the cross, scorning its shame."

733
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:31,020
 It says, "Let us run the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and

734
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,500
 the perfecter of our faith, throwing off the sin that so easily entangles us."

735
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,300
 Because somewhere in this message, in your heart, you might ask the question, "How serious

736
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,540
 do I need to take it?"

737
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:49,100
 And I'm just going to tell you, I don't know that you can take it too serious.

738
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:58,300
 I don't know what subscription you need to cancel, what phone you need to sell, what

739
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,780
 you need to cut out.

740
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,820
 But don't just cut out things.

741
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,540
 You have to let the gospel in.

742
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,060
 You have to know that this God sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for your sins, and

743
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,660
 he raised him from the dead.

744
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,500
 And that if you believe in that, you will not perish, but you will live forever, not

745
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,980
 because of what you've done, but because of what he did on your behalf.

746
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,380
 Friends, I stumbled into this place hungover.

747
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,220
 I smelled like smoke from the night before.

748
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:35,520
 I loved the $2 margarita specials on Tuesday.

749
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,100
 And I would go to the clubs, and I would go to the bars, and I would go to the girls'

750
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,380
 apartments, and I would go to all the places that weren't good for me.

751
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,780
 And you know how a GPS works?

752
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,380
 It wants to take you to the places you've been before.

753
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,020
 "Oh, I know where you're going.

754
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,860
 Here, just let's go."

755
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,620
 And those addresses, they'll hang out in that GPS.

756
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,260
 But if you start putting new addresses in, "No, I'm going to go to community group.

757
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,900
 No, I'm going to go to church.

758
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,300
 No, I'm going to go to the porch.

759
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,060
 No, I'm going to go hang out with these friends.

760
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,860
 All of a sudden, I'm going to change my playmates and my playground."

761
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,500
 And those old addresses fall out, and new addresses replace them.

762
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
 And you heal your heart.

763
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,300
 You surround yourself with the things of Jesus.

764
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,900
 Right now, the question for you is, do you have more inputs of the world or more inputs

765
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,360
 of the kingdom?

766
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,020
 Have you set your destination on your new home?

767
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,900
 Is it set to the right destination?

768
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,940
 If it's not, it's no wonder why your life continues to take you the way of sin.

769
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,740
 I'm going to pray for you that you would.

770
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:55,580
 Father, would you help us renew our minds, have a new hope, see your desires for us,

771
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,940
 and what you've done for us in Christ?

772
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:09,260
 Even as we sing this song, will you just help us to look at the cross and deeply into an

773
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,060
 empty tomb?

774
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,780
 And right now, Lord, would you convict us?

775
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,100
 Would you show us what relationships we need to remove?

776
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,780
 What destinations we need to stop going to?

777
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,080
 What show we need to stop watching?

778
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,500
 What song we need to stop listening to?

779
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,260
 What book we need to stop reading?

780
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,860
 Who we need to stop hanging out with?

781
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:38,420
 And God, would you give us a greater affection for Christ, that we wouldn't just become smarter

782
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,740
 sinners, but we would live the lives of saints?

783
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,820
 Surrender to your Holy Spirit.

784
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,140
 In the name of Jesus, amen.
