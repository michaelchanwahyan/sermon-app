[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Hello, friends.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   How are we doing?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   The porch.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Yeah, it's great to be here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:28.940]   Hello to all our friends watching online and over at different porch live locations.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.300]   We are glad to be together.
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.960]   We are making our way through Song of Solomon.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.120]   And this is a classic story, a love story between this shepherd king, this glorious
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.520]   noble one, and this woman that he loved.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.760]   And he gave her beauty, and he gave her significance and meaning and joy.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.040]   And there was all kinds of energy between the two of them.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.920]   We have been working our way through principles that we've seen in this love story, this song
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.760]   of songs, from just what should attract you to how you should begin to court one another,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.760]   to what intimacy looks like in a God-ordained relationship.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.000]   But you're going to find out this isn't just a love story.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.060]   This is a real story.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.760]   And so in the midst of every real story, every real relationship, you're going to find out
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.880]   that it's not all a honeymoon.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.680]   There's a great story about a little girl that had a mom that was occupied, busily working
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   in the house and trying to clean the house and get ready for different things.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.200]   So his parents were prone to do, had the little girl sit down and watch a little movie.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.560]   It happened to be Snow White, right?
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760]   And so the little girl watched it, and it was over.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.440]   She kind of came running in afterwards and said, "Mom, Mom, Mom, you're not going to
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.440]   believe it.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   It was an amazing story."
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   And the mom goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   I've seen it.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   I've seen it."
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.440]   And she goes, "No, no, no, Mom.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   It was awesome."
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   She goes, "Well, what happened?"
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.400]   So the little girl starts to tell the story about Snow White and all that went on, how
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.280]   she ate the apple and the wicked witch put her to sleep.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280]   And she was kind of there.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.440]   And this gorgeous young man came up and kissed her.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.360]   And then, and the little girl said, "You know what happened next?"
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.440]   And the mom said, "Yeah, they lived happily ever after."
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.600]   She goes, "No, they got married."
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.120]   Like those two things are not the same.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.120]   Right?
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.640]   Disney doesn't show you what happens after the kiss.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640]   Because Disney is just a fairy tale.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.880]   It's just a story.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.160]   But this isn't a fairy tale.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.920]   And so this love story is a real story.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.880]   People have said for a long time, every wedding is happy.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.200]   It's the living together afterwards that causes the trouble.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Right?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.280]   One guy walked up and said, "Hey, I wanted the ideal.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   I got an ordeal.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280]   And now I want a new deal."
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   Right?
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.760]   There's the engagement ring, the wedding ring, and the suffering.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.480]   I mean, these things are all over the place.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.720]   And so people are like, "Hey, what's going on?"
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.320]   What I'm going to show you is this book that God gives us that talks about the basis of
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.600]   relationships, what should be ultimately the source of your attraction, how you go about
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:56.240]   evaluating the potential life mate that you might have, what God delights in, in the context
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.480]   of a healthy relationship where we freely give ourselves to one another.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.160]   Sex is God's idea.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340]   He is kind.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.960]   And he's just telling you how to use this amazing gift.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   He's now going to tell you what to do when you get involved in a relationship and it's
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   not all about the honeymoon.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.320]   But let's just go back just for a second to the honeymoon.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.080]   I'd encourage you to go back and catch those last three weeks if you're just diving in
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   with us.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.000]   But before we dive into this next section, which by the way, this should tell you something.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.880]   You get one chapter on attraction, you get one chapter on courtship or dating, and you
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.040]   get about a chapter and a half on sex, but you get two chapters on conflict.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.960]   About 25% of this book deals with relational discord.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.840]   Why is that?
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.600]   Because life is filled with conflict.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.700]   I'm going to tell you, conflict is an opportunity.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.180]   It's an opportunity to glorify God, to serve others, and to grow yourself.
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.840]   It's an amazing gift to be able to work through conflict.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   In fact, if you look at people who study marriages and human relationships, they will tell you
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.840]   that the number one predictor of marital failure is the habitual avoidance of conflict.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.400]   Some of you guys, when you get in conflict, you are what I would call peace fakers.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   You do all that you can.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   You kind of withdraw, and you just kind of make peace, and you don't deal with the real
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.920]   issues that are there before you.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.960]   That's not the way that God calls you to go.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   Some are peace breakers.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.400]   You know, you come at me, I'm going to come back at you twice as hard.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.820]   You're peace breakers.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.820]   You escalate.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.820]   You don't withdraw.
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.780]   In fact, we tell couples all the time, "Listen, there are four basic things that people do
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.780]   in the midst of conflict."
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.900]   What we kind of do to help ourselves remember is we say, "Don't be a weenie.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.900]   Deal with conflict biblically."
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   What do most folks do?
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900]   They withdraw.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   They're peace fakers.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   They escalate.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.900]   They're peace breakers.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.380]   They negatively interpret that the reason that there's a problem is because they've been
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.220]   so convinced and so battered and bruised throughout a lot of relationships, they're going to always
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.420]   look for trouble that's coming.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.540]   And so they're going to negatively interpret every action and every even movement maybe
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.500]   towards reconciliation, or they're just going to invalidate another person's feelings.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.980]   Those are things you don't want to do in conflict.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.040]   I'm going to show you what to do in conflict from Song of Solomon.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.980]   And God has your best interest in mind.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.500]   And so he's given us a record of this amazing love story, but real love is real.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.700]   It's not pretend.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   Love is reality.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.700]   Lust is confusion.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.380]   Only in the midst of passion is there any confusion.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.140]   Some of you guys are convinced that you love somebody because you're moving towards intimacy.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.460]   In fact, you're not having a real relationship where you're getting to know one another because
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.200]   you're distracted by the strong pull of sexual intimacy.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.860]   And just like when somebody gets addicted to alcohol or certain chemicals, abuses, and
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.860]   they stop maturing, that's just a fact, right?
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.180]   But if somebody gets addicted in their teen years and the way they deal with life's hurts
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.340]   and hangups and problems is by escaping into a false reality, you're going to see that
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.500]   they don't mature.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.260]   And when they finally sober up around 28 or 30, or when they are between binges, you're
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.620]   going to find they're just like a child.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.620]   They throw tantrums.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.580]   They're a 28-year-old chronologically, but they're still a 16-year-old in the way that
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.020]   they go through human relationships because they didn't face those relationships with
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.340]   the natural maturing process that God uses as we go through various trials.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.500]   When you escape with them with a false enablement, when you numb yourself to pain, instead of
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.860]   dealing with it, you don't grow to the full measure of a man or woman you should be.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.500]   Sex is like that in a relationship.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.860]   It's just a fact.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.140]   If you live in the context of a honeymoon without commitment and covenant, you're going
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.500]   to have one or two things happen.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.780]   Premarital sex will keep you in a bad relationship longer than you should be in there, or it's
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.420]   going to be a source of guilt and shame, and it's going to drive you out of what could
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.940]   have been a potentially great relationship before its time.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.940]   Love is reality, man.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.140]   Lust is confusion.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.140]   Lust is illusion.
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.980]   And only in the midst of any kind of passion is there any confusion about what it is.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:19.500]   I'm going to talk to you about the primary problem with premarital sex tonight in the
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.460]   context of talking about conflict.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.420]   Before we get there, though, I just want to remind you of the kindness of God.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.900]   We're not selling anything with you here, okay?
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.620]   We don't get any commission for your conversion.
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.380]   What we're trying to do is share with you, though, the kindness of God.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.180]   We are one beggar who has found bread, and we're telling other beggars where they might
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.900]   find the satisfaction that we have found.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.860]   And so we're just letting you know about the goodness of God.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.180]   It's the blessing of the Lord that makes rich.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.180]   And watch this.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.820]   He adds no sorrow to it.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:04.940]   What the enemy always wants you to do is to focus not on the result of your sin, but on
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.260]   the initial sweetness of it.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.020]   But the Lord's not like that.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.860]   It's the blessing of the Lord that makes your life full of what you want your life to be
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.260]   full of, and he adds no sorrow to it.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.500]   There's no aftertaste, no bitterness.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   Watch this.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:26.380]   Let me just compare and contrast God's version of sex and maybe the version of sex that way
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.620]   too many of you guys have already experienced.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.620]   Look at this.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.940]   We ended the honeymoon last week in Song of Solomon in chapter 5, verse 1.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.940]   This is what it says.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:44.460]   At the very end of this coming together, you have the lover, the male, say, "I've come
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.980]   into my garden, my sister, my bride.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.500]   I've gathered my myrrh along with my balsam.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.220]   I've eaten my honeycomb and my honey."
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:59.460]   That's a very intimate description of a rather in-depth pleasuring with a woman.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.620]   "I have drunk my wine and my milk."
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.540]   And then there is this little injection right here, and there's a lot of debate amongst
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.780]   scholars about who it might be, but I believe the easiest and best explanation of this is
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:20.380]   the Creator God who's been observing this covenant love expressed in the context of
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.820]   oneness between a man and a woman.
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.700]   I think it's God, and he just says, "Eat, friends.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.060]   Drink and imbibe deeply."
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.300]   I mean, the word "drink" there means drink for pleasure.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.580]   "Imbibe" means take it all the way in.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:38.940]   And there's a lot of delights in that.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.900]   I do this thing called Real Truth Real Quick, and one of the questions I asked one week
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.420]   because it had been emailed in, which is where we get our questions, is somebody just said,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.380]   "Man, will we have sex in heaven?
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.020]   Will we have sex in heaven?"
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.580]   And I don't want to just be a buzzkill to you, okay, but there's no indication that
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.980]   the answer is yes.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.260]   Let me give you a little taste of why.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.660]   By the way, you're like, "What?"
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.660]   Right?
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.660]   Like, "What?
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.660]   Let's go.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.660]   Let's figure it out."
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.660]   Right?
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.500]   I can remember when I was single, all right, and by the grace of God, all right, I hung
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.500]   on.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.740]   I came to know Christ late in my teen years, and I came to believe that God's way was the
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.660]   right and the good way, and he and his kindness preserved me.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.180]   But I can remember there were some times in my early 20s.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.700]   I got married when I was 28, and I can remember there were some times I was thinking, "Man,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.220]   you know, there's always these crazy people that are putting a date on the return of Jesus,"
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.220]   right?
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.220]   And so I was like, "All right, man.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.020]   You know, like, if the Lord's coming back, like, next Thursday, and they're as sure as
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.380]   that as they say they are, I'm just going to marry, you know, the closest thing I can
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:48.860]   to pretty, because I'm not going to heaven where there may not be sex without tasting
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.260]   that."
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.260]   And you know what?
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.260]   It's kind of so funny.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.260]   Here's the way I would say it to you.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.820]   It's kind of like the thing I would tell you about that idea is I don't expect you or
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   I, I mean, we see the scriptures as right now through a mirror dimly.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.500]   Like we can't imagine, like, when you ask a pagan, "Hey, what's heaven like?"
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   They'll say, "I don't know.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.740]   It's like you get 70 virgins."
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:15.140]   Ever heard anybody say that?
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:21.620]   If you serve Allawel, then your reward will be you'll get 70 chicks that have never been
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.540]   with another guy, and they're like yours forever.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.940]   Or you ever heard somebody say this?
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:32.620]   Like, you'll be a god, and you'll get to populate a planet with multiple wives.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.780]   Pagan ideology and theology.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:42.860]   And when you have to place something that is outside of the very nature and the goodness
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.260]   of God into your heaven, what you're really doing is exposing that your god isn't all
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:53.080]   that a true god should be, which is all satisfying.
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:59.340]   There is nothing that God gives you that you need to give you complete satisfaction and
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.860]   joy besides him.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.700]   That's why the psalmist gets a real good glimpse of who God is.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.020]   He says, "There is nothing in heaven on all of earth that I desire besides you.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.700]   In fact, all things become shadows in the light of you."
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.460]   But right now, we're just children, right?
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.620]   We're living in an age where we see dimly.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.500]   We can't even imagine the goodness of God.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.620]   We get glimpses of him.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.620]   We preach about him.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.620]   We hear people preach about him.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.620]   We sing songs about him.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.540]   Like, he's a miracle way maker and he's kind and he's all these things.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.540]   But I'm like, "I don't know.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.540]   I don't know sex."
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:34.100]   And it's kind of like when you ask your five-year-old self, right?
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.340]   What would be the biggest blessing that your little five-year-old self would ever have?
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.340]   You'd be like, "Oh, I don't know.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:45.080]   I mean, like I'd wake up and I'd get Skittles for breakfast and ice cream for lunch and
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.900]   whipped cream for dinner.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.260]   And I'd get to go to Toys R Us and get whatever I wanted."
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.260]   Right?
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.620]   Now, isn't that what like a five-year-old would say?
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.140]   I mean, I get it, but how about if when you were 25, I stuck you with what you wanted
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:03.960]   when you were five years old and you get Skittles for breakfast and tomorrow you get ice cream
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.740]   for lunch and we'll give you whipped cream for dinner and you can go into Toys R Us,
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.260]   which is bankrupt, and get anything you want.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.700]   And I'm just telling you, your view of God is bankrupt if you're like, "Man, I don't
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.980]   want nothing to do with God if I don't get sex in heaven."
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.460]   All right, so go listen to that real truth real quick.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.500]   I developed that more in five or six minutes, okay?
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.780]   But I'm just going to tell you, God's not going to rip you off.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:25.780]   Okay?
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.860]   And so when we finish the honeymoon right here in Romans, I mean Song of Solomon chapter
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.620]   five, we hear God saying, "Hey, have it all."
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:40.500]   By the way, the closest thing that we have to the picture of who God is on earth, right,
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.500]   when people describe, "What's God like?"
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   We don't really know.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.820]   But people do crazy stuff when they're trying to describe the Trinity.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.820]   They go, "I don't know.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.620]   It's kind of like water, you know, like H2O, two parts hydrogen and one part's oxygen.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:57.220]   It's kind of like water is sometimes a liquid at room temperature, sometimes below freezing
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.700]   it's a solid, it's ice, and sometimes when it's really hot, like below boiling, you know,
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.700]   it's steam."
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.700]   And God's kind of like that.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.260]   That's called modalism.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.840]   It's heresy.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:15.380]   God doesn't morph into the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit depending on the climate.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:22.640]   He is eternally dwelt in the person of the Son and the Father and the Spirit.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.720]   And God says, "You want to know, he's the closest thing to what I'm like.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:33.500]   It's when a man and woman without sin become one."
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.140]   And there is still, watch this, there's still distinction.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.200]   In other words, man never stops being man and woman never stops being woman.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   There's equality.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.120]   Okay, man is made in the image of God.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.040]   Woman is made in the image of God.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.560]   And there's also subordination.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.920]   There's headship and there's subjection.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   But watch this.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.840]   Pay careful attention, gals.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.300]   The headship is headship that does nothing from selfishness or empty conceit with humility
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.440]   of mind considers the woman is more important than itself.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.160]   It doesn't really look out for its own personal interests, but especially lifts up that other
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.760]   one and has in itself the same attitude as Jesus who said, "Not my will, but the Father's
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   be done."
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.760]   The Father said, "This is my Son.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   Listen to him.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.160]   There's no other name in heaven on earth that's going to be more exalted than Jesus."
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.660]   And the Spirit says that he's going to remind you of Christ and exalt Christ.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.520]   And Jesus says, "When I leave, it's going to be better for you because the Spirit's
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   going to come."
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.580]   And what you get inside the Trinity is this mutually submissive, exalting, equal in dignity
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.580]   relationship.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:44.200]   Girls, the guy you dream of is not like you.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.240]   And he doesn't even just like you.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:53.800]   He loves you and he puts aside his interest to cherish you, to honor you, to protect you,
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.500]   to provide you, provide for you and care for you.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.340]   That's the kind of guy you dream of, not some passive, submissive guy that you can control
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.720]   and jerk around.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:12.540]   And you certainly don't dream of a jerk who whenever he's around you does whatever he
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.720]   wants to do for his own delight.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   No, what you're dreaming of is the kind of relationship, and this is what God says, "Ah,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.260]   there's no perfect picture of who I am on earth, but the closest is when you get two
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:31.360]   distinct individuals that are equal in glory and dignity and have different strengths and
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   values and abilities and roles, but they are mutually submissive to one another in love.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:49.320]   And when they come together, there is more delight than any other fleeting thing on earth."
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:17:00.240]   Listen, doesn't it make a little sense to you if God is God, that intimacy with him
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.640]   is better than just an orgasm, than a moment?
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:12.800]   Man, he better be, or your God's too small.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.560]   And I get it, he's not mad at you that right now you can't imagine 25-year-old life if
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.560]   you're a five-year-old without ice cream, but I'm telling you there's something better,
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560]   something's coming.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.120]   God's told us that.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.360]   So you're not getting ripped off when you think about what may not be in heaven because
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.720]   what's in heaven is God, and you will fully know him as you're fully known.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   Now watch this.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.000]   As you think about God, though, giving you delight in the context of the kind of relationship
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.440]   that he intends for a man informed by the love of God, you're going to see the man in
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.400]   this relationship that we just celebrated last week at the very end of all through chapter
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.120]   four, in the very one verse in chapter five, is a man informed by a love that should make
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.480]   you think of Jesus, should make you think of God the Father.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:05.000]   And you're going to see that worked out beautifully in this focus on conflict that we're going
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.920]   to be on this week, but when you get a man who is spirit-filled and God-surrendered and
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:20.120]   who is spiritually appraised and a woman who is spirit-filled and loves and wisely chooses
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.440]   to yoke herself to somebody who knows the kindness and love of God, who has himself
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.160]   been forgiven so he forgives, who has self-received grace so he extends grace, and that woman
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:35.940]   understands that to be subject to God's order is not going to cause sorrow but a blessing,
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:42.280]   and they come together in mutual submission and selflessness and recklessness and service,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.200]   it ends in, "Oh, man!"
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.640]   And God delights in that.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.120]   But let me just show you human sex.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.160]   I mean, earthly sex, right?
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.160]   And so to do that, I'm going to take you just very quickly to Proverbs 7.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   So I'm going to contrast where we ended last week with what the world is offering you.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:13.120]   This is another man that comes with a woman to a place of great intimacy, and in Proverbs
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:19.440]   7, verse 21, it says this woman, "With her many persuasions, she entices him.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.680]   With her flattering lips, she seduces him."
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.520]   Suddenly, though, watch this, "You're not going to find next.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.680]   Drink deeply.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.280]   There's nothing but warning."
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   Careful, careful, don't be seduced by the promise of fleeting pleasure because it's
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.880]   not the pleasure I designed.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.240]   Don't try and get a God-given pleasure in a God-forbidden way.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:46.480]   Don't meet a legitimate need in an illegitimate way because it's going to lead to death.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.120]   I'm going to just insert right here before I just read what happens next, this illustration
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.480]   which is just so powerful to me.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:04.120]   It's how Eskimos would deal with wolves that would come in and would be predatory to the
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.340]   region.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.580]   What they would do is they would take a knife, a sharp blade, and they would have killed
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.480]   some livestock, and they will take that blade and they'll dip it in blood, and they will
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.440]   take that blade dipped in blood, and they will put it outside where it's cold, and that
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440]   will freeze.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.080]   Then they'll re-dip it in blood, and they'll let it freeze, and they'll re-dip it in blood,
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   and let it freeze, and they'll re-dip it in blood, and let it freeze.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:34.040]   Eventually, you've got this blood popsicle outside the blade, and then they will dip
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.880]   it in blood one more time.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:44.920]   These wolves that have been marauding their dogs, and their children, and their provision,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:51.120]   they'll dip it in blood, and they'll stick that knife blood popsicle into the ice, and
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.240]   they'll go to bed.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.720]   Now wolves will smell the scent of that blood, and they will come in, and they will move
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   towards it.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.680]   Now what do you think will happen when the warm tongue of that wolf starts to lick on
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.500]   that blood that's there, that's dripping down?
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.960]   What happens is the warmth of their tongue, it melts the next layer of blood, and so there's
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   more blood.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:17.120]   The more they lick, and the more they get excited, the more there's this frenzy on top
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.720]   of this popsicle.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.680]   What happens is while their warm tongue is melting the cold ice, the cold ice is numbing
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.760]   their tongue, until eventually this source of great delight becomes a source of death.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.200]   What happens is now they're licking the blade, but there's now fresher blood than there's
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.160]   ever been, and more of it, and they don't know that it's theirs.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:47.880]   Whenever I tell that story, I kind of always go like, "Yeah, it hurts."
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:53.040]   But this part of the scripture says that we've got to remind each other that it's the blessing
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.560]   of the Lord that makes the gifts that God intends for us to have gifts where there's
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.320]   no sorrow attached to them.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.560]   Satan always wants you to focus on the reward of sin and not the result of sin, and the
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.000]   reward is so fleeting.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.920]   You don't get enough licks of that blood popsicle to justify the blade.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   This is Proverbs 7.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   I'm going to tell you, when you read the whole thing, it's very seductive.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:29.440]   It almost reads like a pornographic literature, and we are at the climax of it in verse 21.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.720]   She has seduced him.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.760]   Her many persuasions have enticed him.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.120]   Her flattering lips bring him in.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.440]   Suddenly though, here's the reality.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.120]   He follows her as an ox goes to slaughter, as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.560]   until an arrow pierces through his liver as a bird hastens to the snare, so he does not
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.360]   know that this intimacy is not one to imbibe in.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.720]   It's going to cost him his life.
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.400]   That same God that was there in Song of Solomon chapter 5 verse 1 is here for you in Proverbs
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.280]   chapter 7 verse 24.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.880]   "Now, my son, my daughters, listen to me.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   Pay attention to the words of my mouth.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.440]   Don't let your heart turn aside to the ways of the enemy, who wants you to focus on a
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.020]   fleeting reward and not the ultimate results.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.120]   Don't stray into her paths, for many are the victims she has cast down.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.440]   Numerous are her slain."
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.760]   Some of you guys have died that death, haven't you?
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.360]   He just says her house, the way of the adulterous way.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.560]   It leads to Sheol, which is just the resting place of the dead.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.440]   It descends to the chambers of death.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:42.240]   How many of us have had just the scent of there must be life over there and we move
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.400]   toward in our flesh without listening to a wise God who says, "I know it looks good.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.640]   I know you think it'll feed you.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.200]   I know you don't think it hurts.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.240]   I'm just promising you, you don't understand."
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:24:01.600]   That's why you got to read Song of Solomon 1 and 2 and the first part of 3 before you
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.520]   move to that honeymoon, because God loves you.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.880]   He wants to go well with you.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.040]   He's not trying to rip you off.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:17.520]   He's trying to save you from the way that descends to death, the unwanted pregnancy,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.240]   the unwanted used up and discarded night.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:27.560]   No, you are to be cherished and loved and valued by a lover that loves with the love
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   of God.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:36.040]   I'm going to tell you, you're going to need it, because this is earth and none of us are
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   perfect lovers.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.680]   That's why God, when he tells us when we're going to yoke ourselves with somebody, he
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   just says, "Listen."
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.280]   In fact, if I could say it in a very crass way, I'd say this, "Don't marry somebody who's
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.440]   not already well married."
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.560]   What I mean by that is it says in the scripture, "For this cause, a man shall leave his father
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.840]   and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become as one flesh."
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.720]   We know that in the New Testament, Paul takes that verse from Genesis and he says, "This
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.160]   mystery is great, but when I speak that way, I speak of the love of Christ for the church."
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.800]   When a man comes to understand, when a woman comes to understand who God is, we do the
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.960]   exact same thing.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:14.560]   We leave our mother and father and our earthly ways and we no longer pursue the earth ways.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.000]   We begin to cleave to something else.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.980]   We set our mind on the things above, not on the things that are on the earth, and we become
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.520]   one with God.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.880]   We don't lean on our own understanding, but in all our ways, we acknowledge Him.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.640]   When you become that person who forsakes and adjusts every relationship because you've
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:35.080]   met your lover, God, the kindness of God, and you give yourself to Him, and you no longer
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.080]   cleave to the world or run to the world, but you evaluate every new idea, every new opportunity
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.440]   by saying, "Will this bring me closer to my beloved or will this pull me away from Him
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.200]   so I can be one with Him?"
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.140]   When you find somebody who has found the love of God, who has left and forsaken the ways
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.480]   of the world and is cleaving to Him, Jesus is saying, "That's the one you want to go
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.240]   to bed with.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.800]   That's the one you want a covenant with."
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.280]   Because they will know what forgiveness and grace and mercy, and they'll know what love
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.120]   really looks like.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.540]   They won't be lustful people who are confused.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:19.960]   They will be lovers who've been redeemed by a cross where a sovereign shepherd king has
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.520]   redeemed them.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:29.560]   This woman in the story of Song of Solomon was a migrant worker.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:37.240]   The man was a noble king, and he brings her home.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:45.080]   And he says, "You're no longer going to live in the fields slaving to bring forth fruit
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:51.280]   from a cursed earth, come into the palace of relationship with me."
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   Wow.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.920]   That's what God's done with Todd Wagner.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.960]   He's redeemed my life from the pit.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:11.660]   I was a migrant worker who was being abused by a greedy slave master who had me toiling
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:17.600]   to find a nugget of rest under the beating heat of sin, and he redeemed my life from
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.980]   the pit.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.360]   And I'm inviting you to know my lover.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.840]   He's a shepherd king.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.120]   He's the king of peace.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.440]   Now this, you're going to see a picture of me in the Shulamite woman.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:41.860]   You're going to see a picture of me in my forgetting the kindness of God and the conflict
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.420]   that I create with this God that I said I'll leave and forsake all things, I'll cleave
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   only to you.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.980]   Sometimes I get indifferent to God, even to this day.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.460]   It's unbelievable, but I do.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.940]   And he's still so tender towards me.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.080]   But watch this.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   Verse three.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.240]   What you're going to have here is the woman, and she's going to have a dream.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   And you can really look at it one of two ways.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.920]   It either really happened or it happened as a dream.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   Why do I say that?
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   Because it says right here in Song of Solomon chapter five, verse three, I have taken off
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.560]   my dress.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.040]   How can I put it on again?
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   Oh, actually, excuse me.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.040]   I read verse three.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   Let's go to verse two.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   I'm in the wrong spot.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   Let's try that again.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.180]   Reset.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.140]   The woman says in verse two, I was asleep, but my heart was awake.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.140]   So there's two ways to read that.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.760]   Number one is I was asleep, but you know when you're sleeping, your heart is awake or you're
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.440]   dreaming, you're living in a world that's not real.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:37.040]   But there's a picture here in a dream.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.240]   I think it's just as easy to interpret this that what she's saying poetically is I was
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.440]   asleep, but my beloved was not.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   He was out working.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.160]   He was in the fields.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.240]   He was doing what men do sometimes, is they work long and late hours.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   And so whether this is a dream and it really happened or whether it actually was him at
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.120]   work, you're going to see the same idea.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   Okay.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.800]   I believe that she was asleep, but her heart, her beloved, the man of her dreams, if you
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.480]   will, was awake.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.920]   And then she was startled.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.040]   A voice.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.040]   My beloved was knocking.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.040]   Open to me, my sister.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   Listen to this.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   My darling, my dove, my perfect one.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:23.280]   For my head is drenched with dew, my locks with the damp of the night.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.840]   What he's saying is I've been working all night.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.400]   I've been working dusk till dawn.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.920]   I've been beaten down.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.440]   And what do you think the guy wants when he knocks on the door late at night?
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:37.040]   And he goes, darling, my dove, are you asleep?
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   What you wearing?
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.040]   Right.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.440]   That's what I see implied in the text.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.720]   All right.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.200]   And so without reading, right, without reading verse three, what do you think she's going
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   to say?
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   All right.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.560]   You think she's going to go, Oh baby, I'm so glad you're home.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.840]   I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   Let's go.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Right.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   Now let's read it.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   You're like, what?
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   Who's knocking?
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   You got to realize there's a gap between the honeymoon.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   Now we're into the marriage.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   Okay.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   And it's not just, you know, we had the ideal.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.840]   Now we're in the ordeal and the guy's like, baby.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   And she's like, what?
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   All right.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   Got curlers in her hair.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   Slobber on her pillow.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   She's like, I'm so glad you're home.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   Let's go.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   And she's like, I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   I don't mind that you woke me up.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   And she's like, what?
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   All right.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   Got curlers in her hair.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:25.000]   Slobber on her pillow.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.040]   She's not wearing that nightie anymore.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   Right?
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.120]   Those girls long ago put that sucker away.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.560]   They can't even find it.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:40.040]   They're back in that flannel nightgown their grandmother gave them.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.800]   Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.640]   And every woman borrows throughout the rest of their marriage.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.440]   Did your great grandmother wear that to bed?
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.040]   And she's kind of sitting there and she's like, look, dude, I'm taking off my dress.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   How can I put it on again?
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.040]   I've washed my feet.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.040]   It's a long way.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.520]   It's like 20 feet to the door.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:00.080]   You don't want to get my feet dirty again.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.320]   In Hebrew, what this actually says is I've got a headache.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   All right.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.320]   That's what it says in Hebrew.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   All right.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.320]   I just let me be.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.760]   All right, now without reading, what do you think this guy's going to do?
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.760]   Hey, what?
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.760]   I've been out working all night.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:25.600]   Hey, you're a migrant worker sleeping on silk.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600]   Do you forget who I am?
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.600]   Do you know who you are?
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.080]   Do you know what I've done for you?
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.880]   Open the door, brush your teeth and let's go.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   Right?
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   Is that what you expect?
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.600]   No, watch this.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   This is beautiful.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.280]   Verse four.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   She's talking.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   No, what I have is my beloved.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.240]   He extended his hand through the opening.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.880]   So the bolt, the door, I mean, think of the best way I can describe it to you is like,
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.080]   you know, those little locks with a little chain on it that kind of comes open.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.360]   You kind of get your hand through there.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.240]   There's something, his hands coming through the door and maybe almost after he knocked,
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.680]   he kind of looked maybe through there, saw she wasn't asleep and she saw his hand and
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   maybe he just went.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:15.800]   All right.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   No yelling.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.320]   Like, oh, I thought it was, I thought it was dawn enough that you might be up.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   Right?
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320]   So sorry.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.640]   Watch what he does.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.200]   And it's, he says, my feelings were aroused for him.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.400]   Now that's not the word like sexual arousal.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   It's like compassion.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.000]   Like, oh my gosh, you know, you know how I get it when we're startled sometimes in our
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   sleep it says in the, in the Proverbs, he awakens a friend with a loud voice in the
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.080]   morning and shall be reckoned to a curse like him.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   And he's excited to get home.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.200]   I mean, the guy's a newlywed and we don't know how long they've been married, but he's
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   like, baby, baby, dad.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Okay.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.200]   Now watch.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.160]   What do you think she's going to do?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   You think she's going to go good and don't do it again.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.440]   How much money did you make?
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.840]   Go make more and let me sleep.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.960]   You think that's what she's going to say?
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.720]   No, it says at this moment, what happened is she kind of came to her senses.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.200]   She says, my feelings were aroused.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.080]   I felt some compassion.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.720]   And she says, I arose to open to my beloved.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.700]   And when she went to the door, it says, my hands drip with myrrh and my fingers with
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.760]   liquid myrrh on the handles of the bolt.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.600]   In other words, what was tradition at the times, if you would go and visit somebody
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.240]   and they weren't home is you would leave perfume on the door.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.560]   You would, you would, you would anoint the door because a friend is like a pleasant aroma.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.560]   Like I love you.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.320]   And, and almost like you would have a, um, like a, a family perfume.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Oh man, the Wagner's were here.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.520]   So pleasant when they come by.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   Right.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.680]   I mean, that's what, that was a tradition of the day.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.200]   And he didn't just go and get angry.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:00.560]   He's like, and he, and he anointed, he just said, I love you.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.600]   I want you when you think of me, I want you to know I love you.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.120]   And, and you know, I mean, uh, it's just, he just drenched it.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.800]   Now he doesn't come at her.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.240]   He doesn't do this.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.280]   Um, this thing that maybe so much of us would do, which is to kind of just drop some truth
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   on her.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   Right.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.320]   So in first Corinthians chapter seven, verse three, okay.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.500]   There's this verse that says, Hey, you know, like the husband must fulfill his duty to
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:30.440]   his wife and the wife must fulfill his duty to her husband.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.080]   The wife doesn't have authority over her own body, but the husband does.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.440]   And likewise also, he's going to have authority over his, so the wife doesn't have authority
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.440]   over her body.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.440]   Wake up.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.440]   Right.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   He doesn't do that.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   Right.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.280]   Guys, it's not what you should do.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.400]   First Corinthians seven, three through five.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.120]   Now that you've discovered that verses in your Bible, don't go, dude, I'm underlining
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   that.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.680]   And when I get married, like that's going to be in our vows.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.320]   Like I'm going to just say, babe, I don't care.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.560]   Just memorize this one verse, right?
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.560]   We'll get to everything else.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.560]   Just know that verse.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560]   Okay.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.040]   I'm just going to tell you that verse is not in the Bible for you to quote to your
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.160]   wife.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.760]   That's a verse for your wife to obey.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   The verse for you to obey is to love her as Christ loved the church.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.160]   Right?
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.480]   So there's just a reference here, right?
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.040]   In revelation chapter three, verse 20, Jesus says this, behold, I stand at the door and
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.120]   knock.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.640]   If anyone hears my voice and opens the door and comes into me, I will dine with him and
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.420]   he with me.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.080]   But I'm not going to kick the door open.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.600]   I'm not going to rush in and go, do you know who I am?
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.920]   You better give your heart to me.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   No, he's just gently going.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:40.960]   I'd love you to come in.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.080]   I've been working so you can rest.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.440]   In fact, it's finished out here.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.500]   Are you ready to come here?
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.960]   Jesus is inviting you into that and he does it with kindness.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.940]   That's exactly what the scripture says.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.200]   It says you think lightly of the kindness and tolerance and patience of God, not knowing
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.920]   it's his kindness that, that, that myrrh of grace and forgiveness and provision and his,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.880]   his head is drenched with the dew of the morning.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   It's drenched with the blood of judgment.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:14.960]   And he's just trying to wake you from your stupor and your sleep.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.280]   Now what the scripture says is that what we're called to do is to be individuals that when
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.920]   we move towards somebody, we don't, we don't go, I'm going to change you.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.840]   No, in the scripture, you never change your mate.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.360]   You never change your mate.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.600]   What you do is you love your mate.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.680]   Let God deal with them.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.240]   Let God change them.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   You love your wife.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   You love your husband.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.700]   Your job is to love, not change.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:41.960]   This is the biggest mistake most fake, most people make in the context of marital relationships,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   right?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.520]   And by the way, this is what always happens.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.400]   Girls always marry guys thinking they'll change them and guys marry girls thinking they'll
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.080]   never change.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   And they change, right?
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.680]   They don't look like they look when you marry them.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:03.120]   After they've had a couple of kids, nursed a few babies, gravity has had its way, right?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.520]   Hey, this is that a surprise to you, right?
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   Really?
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   No.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:14.360]   Bodies deteriorate, but character and persons develop.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   That's why charm is deceitful.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.400]   Beauty is vain.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.040]   Guys marry a girl like babe.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   Think I'm going to never change.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   They change.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.320]   And girls marry guys go out.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.320]   I'll change it.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:35.760]   Let me just tell you, man, when that guy, he is never going to be more motivated to
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:42.560]   be kind and gracious and deferring to you than when he's trying to close the deal.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.520]   Right?
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:52.840]   And so if that guy isn't doing well before the deal's closed, I mean, just brace yourself.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.200]   You're not going to change him.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.000]   What the scriptures are saying right here is that the way you deal with conflict, I'm
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.640]   going to use Solomon, okay?
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.580]   I'm going to use Solomon as an example of what we should do because Solomon is a type
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.040]   of Christ.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.280]   The male lover in this story is a type of Christ.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.160]   The bride, we're called the bride of Christ, she's a type of me.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.440]   Indifference has crept in.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.960]   And there's conflict in the relationship.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.120]   But watch what the beloved does.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:25.240]   And it says she kind of came and she put her fingers on the door and the handles of the
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   bolt.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   And this is what the scripture says.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.560]   You never pay back evil for evil to anyone.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.640]   That's just not what you should do.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.240]   You bless those who persecute you.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.600]   You bless and do not curse.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.360]   So this is now like from Romans 12.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.720]   And it's going to quote from Proverbs.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.280]   This is in verse 19.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.680]   Never take your own revenge.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.680]   Never.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.080]   Take your own revenge, Romans 12, 19.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.760]   But beloved, leave room for the wrath of God.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   I'll deal with them.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.760]   I'll take care.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.940]   I'll let God deal with them.
[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.860]   You just love them.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.000]   For it's written, vengeance is mine.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.200]   I will repay, says the Lord.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.420]   I'll get their attention.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.760]   Your job is not to get their attention.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   Your job is to love them.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.460]   Because this is what most people do in conflict, right?
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.460]   They manipulate back.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.460]   Like you're going to hurt me, I'm going to hurt you worse.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.960]   You're going to learn not to hurt me.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.160]   I'm going to cut you off sexually.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.960]   I'm not going to respect you.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.940]   I'm going to limit finances to you.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:12.940]   You're going to learn.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.940]   You don't jack with me.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   All right.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:15.940]   Does that work?
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.940]   Right?
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.940]   What do you do when a cold wind blows?
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.940]   Man, you just curl up, right?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:22.940]   You pull the hat down.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.940]   You curl up.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.500]   You're like, no, man.
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   It doesn't work.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:34.380]   Harassment, anger, guilt, criticism, manipulation doesn't work.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.860]   You know what makes the flower unfold is love.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:43.060]   That's why the scripture says, "If your enemy is hungry," Romans 12, 20.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.340]   This is quoting from Proverbs 25.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.660]   "If your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.940]   If he's thirsty, give him a drink.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.300]   For in doing so, you will keep burning coals in their head."
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.220]   In other words, you'll put conviction, a sense of guilt.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   They'll get them.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.220]   You know what happens all the time?
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   And this is a fact.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.140]   When I see people that are in a problem in a marriage, what some people want to do, especially
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.740]   as they move towards divorce, is they try and get that other person to respond to them
[00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.900]   in anger because it's a whole lot easier to leave somebody who's angry at them and saying
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.900]   horrible things to them.
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   Go, "See?
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:06.900]   That's why I'm leaving them.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:07.900]   That right there."
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.900]   And it makes them feel better about themselves.
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:16.140]   But when you have been wronged and you love and you don't take into account a wrong suffered,
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.340]   you don't act unbecomingly, you're not provoked, you don't seek your own, but you bear all
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.340]   things and hope all things and endure all things.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.180]   I'm not talking about staying in the midst of physical abuse.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:30.420]   I'm not talking about enabling sinful behavior, but I'm talking about moving towards somebody
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:36.020]   in love with wisdom.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.300]   I'm going to tell you what God will do.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.060]   God will bring judgment on them, right?
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.060]   Your job is to love them.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.060]   Let God deal with them.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.100]   I tell people all the time, "You know what you should do?
[00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.820]   You want to live your life in such a way that everybody that knows that other person who
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:54.500]   left you, that they will know them to be a fool.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.580]   You clothe yourself in dignity and kindness and love and grace.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.500]   You extend to them what you have received."
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.780]   Now when you do that, right?
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.340]   And I can tell you my relationship with my wife so many times, I just know, I know when
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.340]   I'm being a jerk.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.340]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.900]   And I just watch her move back to me in love.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:17.700]   This is what it says in Proverbs 15, "A gentle answer turns away wrath."
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.620]   And I just see her just kind of move towards me in love.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:24.020]   And by the way, you know what God does with guys who just continue to be abusive towards
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.020]   women?
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.020]   The Bible tells us what he does.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:29.780]   In 1 Peter chapter 3, it says this.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.740]   It says, "You husbands, in the same way you should live with your wives in an understanding
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.780]   way as with someone who is weaker because she's a woman."
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.340]   Women, you're physically weaker.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.980]   Also, I mean, your emotions are tangled.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.980]   You can't bifurcate your life decisions as much.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:45.340]   Women are made differently than men.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.340]   We're not the same, but we are equal, right?
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.300]   If you didn't ever believe that, just look at the transgender craziness now when guys
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:57.660]   who even take hormone blockers and testosterone reducing drugs, they still compete as a woman.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.660]   They dominate.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.320]   There's just a difference in the sexes.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   It's embedded.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.580]   And when you got guys who use what God's given them and he's blessed you to be a blessing
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.660]   and when you use that to be abusive, let me just show you what God's going to do with
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.660]   that.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.620]   It says, "You show her honor as the fellow grace of life," watch this, "so that your
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.020]   prayers will not be hindered."
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.700]   What God basically does to abusive guys, he goes, "You know what?
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.100]   You want to use your power to not be kind to that woman when she cries out to you in
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.100]   need?
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   I'll just show you what that's like.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.640]   Pray all you want, but I'm going to tell you something.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.940]   Your prayers are going to hit the ceiling.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.140]   They're not going anywhere.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:34.180]   I'll show you what it's like to have a sovereign over you who doesn't pay attention to you.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.780]   Your job is not to change, your job is to love.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.300]   Your job is to extend to others what you have freely received.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.100]   That doesn't mean you get abused, right?
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.420]   A loving wife and a loving husband, one of the things you do when somebody is caught
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:54.260]   in sin is you approach them, you talk about that, but then if they don't respond, you
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.680]   widen the circle because you love them.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.500]   I told my wife, someone asked me one time, "Todd, what's the best thing you do to lead
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   your wife in marriage?"
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   I go, "That's easy.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.140]   I give her permission to tell on me."
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.420]   Because I told her, "I want to be God's man.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.900]   I want to love you as Christ loved the church, but I'm also lazy.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.980]   I'm also indifferent.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.420]   This is still earth, so I'm not glorified yet.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.220]   I'm not everything God wants me to be.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.420]   So when I come back at you and I verbally dominate you or I even physically intimidate
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.820]   you, or I withdraw from you, don't let me do that because I'm marrying you to complete
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:28.820]   me to help me be the man that God wants me to be."
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.160]   In fact, I'll tell you a great story about my wife.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.820]   She went to dinner with a bunch of other wives early in our marriage, maybe three, four years
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   in the marriage.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.820]   And so we kind of came back.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   I was working.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   I came in late at night.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   I had dew in my hair.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.820]   It was early morning, dusk to dawn.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   She was still there in the night.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.820]   It was amazing.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.820]   It was gorgeous.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.820]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   I came home and we started talking and I just said to her, "Hey, babe, how was your day?"
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.820]   And she's, "Oh, it was good."
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.820]   I go, "What'd you do?"
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:49.820]   She goes, "I went to lunch with so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so."
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.820]   And I go, "Oh."
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820]   I said, "Was it a good time?"
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   She goes, "It was a good lunch.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.820]   It was okay, actually."
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:59.060]   You know, one of the things that started to happen is everybody was just kind of telling
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:03.740]   stories about their husbands and the things that annoy them.
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.740]   And I went, "Oh, really?"
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.740]   And then she said this.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.700]   She goes, "You want to know what I said?"
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.700]   I went, "Yeah."
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:19.380]   She goes, "I didn't say anything about you."
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.540]   I mentioned to the girls, "Hey, guys, I mean, this is all funny, but listen.
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   I know you.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:27.620]   I know you love your husbands, but, man, this is not going to be, I know."
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:28.820]   And she did as intently as I could.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.740]   I just said, "Hey, we're not going to make sport of how awesome we are because we put
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:36.540]   up with the Neanderthals that we said I do to."
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.540]   And she did.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.020]   She just said, "We just redirected the lunch."
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.340]   She said, "But you know what I said?"
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.340]   She goes, "Nothing about you.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.580]   And the reason isn't because there's not stuff about you that annoys me.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.340]   It's because I realized I hadn't told you what those things were yet."
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:52.660]   What do you think I did when I heard that?
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.660]   And I turned to her.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.660]   I said, "Man, baby."
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.700]   I said, "Tell me what those things are because I don't want a woman that would honor me and
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:05.700]   respect me like that and would not make me sport for her to laugh, friends to laugh and
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.100]   be popular because she's the noblest of all women that lives with Todd."
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.100]   Right?
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.100]   You ever heard that?
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.100]   "Oh, your wife's a saint."
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:18.140]   You know, guys say that to one another all the time.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:19.420]   But it doesn't ever...
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.420]   Guys don't ever come and go, "Dude, man, your wife was throwing you under the bus.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.420]   She's a saint."
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.260]   That never encourages a guy.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.100]   And I just looked at her and I said, "Babe, what..."
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.100]   I said, "Tell me what those things are."
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.100]   And she said, "Okay."
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.580]   And we just sat down and she just said, "Look, will you forgive me for not mentioning this
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.820]   earlier, but here's just a few things.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.940]   And I know who you are and I believe in who you want to be.
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.300]   And here's some things that you can do to love me better."
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:50.620]   So we talked, we prayed, and I said, "Thank you."
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:54.900]   I also told her, "If I don't respond to that, what you do is you widen that circle.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.140]   You get the mighty men that are part of my wedding procession will come around me and
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.540]   say, 'Hey, guys, can you encourage Todd?
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.580]   I've already told him this.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.420]   He knows I'm calling you, but he's struggling.
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.580]   And I know who this man is.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.580]   I know who he wants to be.'"
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.060]   Man, watch this.
[00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:16.340]   It says, "She opened to her beloved, but my beloved had turned away and had gone."
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.900]   So this is what the woman's going to do in response to this kind of love.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.300]   "My heart went out to him as he spoke.
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.740]   I searched for him, but I didn't find him.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.340]   I called him, but he didn't answer me."
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.540]   Now watch what happens.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.940]   Here comes that sense of judgment.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.780]   She realizes, "What was I doing?
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.980]   I wasn't with my beloved."
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.660]   So she just goes out to random worlds, to random guys, not her beloved.
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.540]   "They watched me to make the rounds in the city.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   They found me.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.540]   They struck me and wounded me."
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.780]   Now, I want to make a case here that this is how you know it's a dream, because she
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.180]   didn't move towards him in her dreams.
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.420]   She was indifferent to him.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:43.820]   She was thinking, "Ah, he's kind of a bother.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   I want to get my sleep."
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.420]   And then she realized, "No, before this guy, the random guy, he was abusive towards me.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.700]   He wasn't like my beloved.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.020]   Watch."
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.700]   And then she just goes on in this, "They struck me and wounded me.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.980]   The guards with the walls, they took away my shawl from me.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.980]   I was cold."
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.820]   Instead of finding peace with her man, she found harsh treatment.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.980]   "There's no life here.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.180]   I wish I had run to him and clung to my beloved."
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.180]   She's come to her senses.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.900]   "Isn't that you after sin, right?
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.420]   Isn't that what you do every time?
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.420]   You're like, 'What am I doing?
[00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   I'm beaten again.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.420]   It's cold.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:19.420]   God, why'd you leave me?'"
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.420]   "I didn't leave you.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.420]   I was like, 'Come, come.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.420]   Come off those silk sheets, the false promise.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.420]   Come here.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.420]   Let me embrace you.'"
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420]   "Nah."
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.740]   You start to feel like that, don't you?
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.740]   Watch.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:34.740]   Watch what happens.
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.740]   And so she goes out.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.780]   She's saying, "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved as to what
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.500]   you will tell him, for I am lovesick.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   I miss him.
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.500]   I want to be reunited."
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.980]   "What kind of beloved?" they say.
[00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   "He's your beloved, O most beautiful among women."
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.820]   This is exactly what we need to do.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:49.820]   We need to remind each other.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.860]   That's why we get together corporately and sing, and we just say, "Hey, listen, I got
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.540]   to remind you who God is.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.260]   He is a way maker, man.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.260]   He is the way of peace.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.260]   He's a way maker.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:05.380]   He's a way maker of restoration and forgiveness and wholeness and dignity and beauty.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.820]   What kind of beloved is your beloved?"
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.380]   And then she just starts to rehearse.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.380]   All right?
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.580]   I love Psalm 101 where it says, "I will sing of your loving kindness and justice.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.340]   To you, O Lord, I will sing praises."
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:20.120]   In other words, what a wise person does is they wake up and they just go, when you wake
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:23.240]   up and you're in your bed, the first thing you ought to do when you're startled awake
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:29.900]   by your alarm, may your first thought be of your beloved, just, "Oh, God, you're the God
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.340]   of grace and mercy who redeemed my life from the pit, who loves me, who makes me whole
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.340]   again.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.580]   Oh, let me run to you.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:43.420]   Let me wake and not be indifferent to you this day."
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.780]   This is what she says, "My beloved is dazzling and ready, outstanding among 10,000.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.700]   His head is like gold, pure gold.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:54.920]   His locks are like clusters of dates and black as a raven.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.080]   His eyes are like the doves beside streams of water bathed in milk."
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.080]   I mean, do you get that?
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   There is no little, you don't need no visine.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.080]   This guy's pop.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.320]   I mean, girls, can you see this guy?
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.600]   He's tall, dark, and handsome.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.080]   "His cheeks like beds of balsam, banks of sweet-scented herbs.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.640]   His lips are like lilies dripping with liquid myrrh.
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.080]   His hands are rods of gold set with beryl.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.920]   His abdomen is carved ivory inlaid with sapphires.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:27.000]   His legs, she's going from his head to his feet, and she is reminding herself, 'My beloved
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.480]   is altogether wonderful.'"
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.120]   Do you do that?
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:35.880]   In the midst of your indifference to God, maybe indifference to one another, you remind
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.880]   yourself, "No, I know who you are.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.360]   You're a child of God, and your desire is to be who God wants you to be.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.160]   I'm going to move back towards who you are in Him, but specifically, even in sin, I'm
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.720]   going to use this even more, not so much in a marital relationship, but I'm going to use
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.400]   this towards you and your relationship with God."
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.560]   Do you remind yourself who He is?
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:51.560]   Those songs?
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.000]   "From head to toe, God is splendid.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.360]   His mouth is full of sweetness.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.160]   He is wholly desirable.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   This is my beloved.
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.160]   This is my friend.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   Oh, daughters of Jerusalem."
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.440]   And they're like, "Are you serious?
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   That's who He is?
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.860]   That's who you were indifferent towards in your bed?"
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.400]   The girls say, "Where has they gone, O most beautiful among women?
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.920]   Where has your beloved turned?
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   Let's go.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   Maybe he's got a brother."
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   Right?
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:21.200]   Maybe he's got a single friend.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   Are you...
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.240]   Listen, this is the way we talk about...
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.640]   This is what my wife did with her girlfriends.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:31.480]   Let me tell you, shouldn't it be a badge of honor, girls, when you talk about the way
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.560]   your husband loves you and seeks you and serves you, is kind towards you?
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.040]   When my wife said, "Hey, Todd annoys me."
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.040]   And you guys know Todd.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.400]   They were all my friends at the table with her.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:43.040]   But I haven't told him yet some of the things, so I'm not going to laugh about them with
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   you.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.600]   They're like, "Dang."
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.840]   And I know he'll listen when I tell him.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.960]   "Dang."
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.080]   And I bet your husbands will listen too because I know them.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.080]   "Dang."
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:56.080]   Right?
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.160]   And how about when your friends are like, "Man, come on.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.160]   Why are you leaving?
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.280]   How come you don't want to party with us like you used to?"
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.180]   Do you know enough of your God to start from the head of who He is to His feet?
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:12.720]   And people are going to lean in and go like, "Can I know that guy?
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   This is who he is.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.680]   Watch this."
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.360]   She says, again, I'll tell you where he is.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   She's confident.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.200]   "My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of balsam, to pasture his flock in
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.560]   the gardens and gather lilies."
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.720]   He's right where he should be.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   He hadn't moved on.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:32.080]   He isn't looking for some woman who's going to treat him right.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.480]   He's my ... He went back to work because he saw I needed some more rest.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:39.600]   I am secure in His love and you ought to be secure in God's love for you.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.600]   Look at verse three.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.400]   She says, "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine."
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.720]   She goes, "There is commitment here."
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   Right?
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.560]   When I become one with my wife, I'm one with my wife.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.520]   And so when things are not going well with my wife, I don't discard her.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.320]   When my knee hurts, I don't amputate myself with a thigh.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.240]   When I jam my finger, I don't put it in a kitchen drawer, you know, with a knife and
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.520]   go, "Off with that."
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   No.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:02.920]   When my wife is hurting, the Bible says, "You go to her because you're one."
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:06.560]   And I'm just going to tell you, it's a fact.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.800]   My life is not doing well when my wife isn't doing well.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.500]   But when my wife, it's a George Strait song, when she looks so good in love, when I stole
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:19.140]   some stars from the sky and gave them to her and put in her eye, I'm like, "Man, she looks
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:24.440]   good in love and it's good with me."
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:32.720]   And there's no way I can love her unless I give her the love that I've received.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:39.360]   Because I have met the shepherd king who reminds me, "Hey, no matter what she does to you,
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:46.920]   big boy, whatever indifference or moodiness or meanness, it is nothing compared to your
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.080]   moodiness, indifference, and meanness to me.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.360]   And I love you."
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.720]   So you go give her that love.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   Watch this.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.400]   She is secure.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.760]   There's a covenant commitment here.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:05.400]   This is not just a fleeting, there's no back door if you want to use a phrase.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.600]   They're not just living together when things get hard, go, "I'm moving on, babe."
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.680]   No, there's a covenant commitment here.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   Watch this.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.640]   She was sure about his covenant love and she was sure about his kindness.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.520]   My beloved, he is the one who pastors his flock among the lilies.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.120]   He's gentle.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:28.280]   I know I wronged him, but he is gentle and he will love me.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.960]   Watch this.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   So she finds him.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.240]   And this is now the beloved.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:38.060]   This is God towards you in your sin.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.480]   When you come back and you're reminded, you come to your senses.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:46.200]   You been there?
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.840]   And you come to your senses.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.440]   You are as beautiful as Terza, my darling.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.080]   That's a mountain city.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.680]   He's like Aspen in the fall.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.520]   Just beautiful, crisp, clear air.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.400]   High blue skies.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.040]   He says, "That's who you are to me, darling.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.840]   You're invigorating.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.840]   You're as lovely as Jerusalem.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   That's the holy city.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.320]   You're still holy to me.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.600]   I said I loved you.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:17.080]   Your beauty comes from my attributing it to you.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:18.480]   You're as awesome as an army with banners.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.240]   I mean, you're just worthy of awe.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.760]   Can you imagine you've been indifferent and complacent and you got away from God?
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   And what's the enemy say?
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:31.560]   Most people say, "Ah, you screwed that up, you migrant worker.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:34.480]   You think he's going to love you again?"
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:36.520]   If he's God's man, he will.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.640]   If it's God's woman, she will.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.680]   But you don't continue to sin so grace can abound.
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.080]   You just come to your senses quickly.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.900]   You see one sleeping with six guys in her bed.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:53.120]   She had a moment where her flesh was indifferent to the wonders and the mercies of love.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.840]   And it ought to concern you if you hope he doesn't come knocking in the morning so you
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:05.440]   can just run a few other lovers through your bed until you're convicted.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.680]   I mean, there's a quick coming to your senses.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.480]   And you come to your senses when you remind who you are.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.880]   But she responds to him.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   And watch what he says.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.960]   "Turn your eyes away from me, for they have confused me."
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:25.040]   And what he's saying right there is, "Baby, you're coming at me right now, hard, and your
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.560]   eyes," if you remember back earlier in the love chapter where he looks at her eyes and
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.120]   he just melts, he's like, "Okay, man, I'm going to melt into those eyes and we are going
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.120]   to be one."
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:40.840]   And he's saying, "Baby, I'm so, this is who you are to me, but let there be no mistake."
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.800]   What he's really saying right here, "My love is real.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.840]   It wasn't manipulative love, so don't come to me like you want me now because I wasn't
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   kind to you so you would come pursue me and give yourself to me.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.440]   I just love you."
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.880]   And then he says this, watch this, "I don't want sex.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.040]   I'm not looking for makeup sex."
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:06.480]   Okay, which by the way, in your relationships, there should be makeup sex because there should
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.000]   be sex in the first place.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.980]   Let me just insert this right here, okay, are you ready?
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.120]   This is the biggest problem with premarital sex.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.600]   I already told you, it'll keep you in a bad relationship longer than you should and it'll
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:19.760]   push you out of a good one before it's time, but here's the biggest problem with premarital
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.760]   sex.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.600]   Like some guys will say, "Man, I can't even control myself, baby.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:23.600]   You're so fine."
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.600]   Right?
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.840]   I mean, surely God wouldn't want me to not do this.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.640]   He made me this way, okay?
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.040]   If you think, and this is just a fact, if you think it's hard to control your sexual
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.000]   urges before you're married, wait till you see how hard it is to control your tongue
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.920]   after you're married.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:49.120]   It is easier to keep your pants zipped than your lip.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.120]   Read James 3.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.040]   This thing sets the world on fire.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.560]   It destroys relationships.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.880]   And by the way, you marry a guy and you're not going to want him to be abusive and manipulative
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.400]   and critical and remind you that you're just a migrant worker and you're lucky and you
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.260]   ... Right?
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:12.580]   A guy that doesn't control his flesh before marriage and a guy that doesn't want to honor
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.140]   God before marriage, why are you going to be surprised after he puts a ring on it that
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.740]   all of a sudden he's going to go, "Hey, I know I've never done what God wanted.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:20.980]   I just did what my flesh wanted to do."
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:21.980]   Why are you going to be surprised?
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:24.900]   I'm not even talking sexually, but you ought to think about that.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.900]   Right?
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:27.620]   The thing you caught him with, this is the thing you're going to lose him for.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:34.040]   But I'm going to tell you, even if he's not unfaithful, he is going to be unfaithful because
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.060]   he's already showed you, "I don't roll the way God wants me to roll.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:43.860]   So don't be surprised when there's conflict when I don't roll the way Solomon rolled.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.180]   I awoke in love before it's time because I love me some me.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.380]   And over here, when you're bothering me, I'm going to love me some me and I'm going to
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.700]   let you know you don't do that.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.340]   And don't come to me surprised."
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:59.620]   The biggest problem with premarital sex is it's a tell.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:05.940]   It's showing you that this guy doesn't care about you and doesn't care about a loving
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:07.500]   God who has your best interest in mind.
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.540]   He cares about him.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:15.620]   And so he is not going to execute the playbook of restoration, reconciliation, kindness,
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:17.300]   and covenant commitment over here.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:20.220]   He's told you that.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:24.980]   So the problem is that there is a huge red flag and declaration here that you are not
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:28.260]   yoking yourself to somebody who knows the goodness of God, and then you're going to
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:36.580]   want the goodness of God to show up with that guy over here.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   Watch what he does.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.100]   You marry that guy, he's not trying to manipulate you back into kindness.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.700]   He just wants you to know, "I love you, baby.
[00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:43.700]   Don't confuse me.
[00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.100]   Don't even be confused by my love.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.300]   I don't want something from you.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.860]   I just want you to know I love you."
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:50.860]   And so here's the thing.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:59.980]   Song of Solomon 6, verse 5, is the same as Song of Solomon 4, verse 2, which is at the
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.540]   height of the honeymoon.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:04.740]   This is what restoration and reconciliation look like.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.060]   Your hair is like a flock of goats that are descended from Gilead.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:09.340]   Your teeth are like a flock of ewes which have come up from their washing, all of which
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.340]   bear twins.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.340]   Now one of them has lost her young.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.380]   This is Song of Solomon verse 4, verse 3.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.380]   There's a reason.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:19.220]   What God's doing right here is he's showing you that this is what real conflict resolution
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.220]   looks like.
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.220]   It is a reconciliation.
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.180]   You're right back where you were at the height of your love because you're married to somebody
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.820]   who never stops loving you.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.540]   This is a picture of how godly people relate, and this is a picture of how God relates.
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:35.060]   Are you all tracking with me?
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:36.060]   Have you ever felt that?
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.060]   Right?
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.060]   Like, "Oh, man, I can't go back again, Todd."
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:44.820]   Yes, you can.
[00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:46.340]   He says, this is where God speaks.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.260]   Again, he says in verse 8, this is where the lover speaks.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.740]   There are 60 queens, Eddie Conway, but I can go lots of places.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:53.420]   They're made without number.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.860]   But my dove, my perfect one, my one and only, the one I covenanted with, that's you.
[00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.860]   You're unique.
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.380]   I don't just run to some other woman because it's hard, because you're on your period,
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.660]   because you've been mean.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:18.220]   I'm the guy you hope for because he's the God I hope for, and his love lives in me.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.780]   Ladies, does your heart go aflutter when I talk like this?
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:28.460]   Men, do you want to be that kind of guy who can do that?
[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.860]   You're the pure child.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:31.700]   The maidens saw her color blessed.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.700]   Of course they do, because who is this woman who loves like this?
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:40.780]   Who is this that grows like the dawn, as beautiful as the full moon, as pure as the sun?
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.500]   The very end, it starts in verse 12.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:47.260]   It just says, "Before I was aware, my soul set me over the chariots of my noble people."
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.540]   My beloved took me back and put me right where I was before.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:55.100]   He put me back in a place of honor, a chariot over all the people.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.260]   The women yelled at her, "Come back, come back, oh Shulamite.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.460]   Come back, come back, that we may gaze at you."
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:05.100]   The word Shulamite is ... The word in Hebrew for Solomon is Shulamah.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:11.980]   So Shulamite is like, "You who are one with the king, who is glorious in all you do."
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:16.960]   The king looks back, "Why are you surprised that she's here with me?"
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.540]   Because of the dance of two companies.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.460]   What he's saying right there is like, when a couple's first fall in love, there's two
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.020]   companies that come together, the bridal company and the groom's company.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:28.500]   They come together and it's a glorious thing when there's a new family that's there.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.740]   What he's saying is, "Yeah, there was conflict.
[01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740]   Yeah, there was trouble.
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.300]   Why are you surprised like two companies are coming together?
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.220]   We were never not one.
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.540]   This is my beloved.
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.940]   Yes, we had a moment.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.820]   It's earth.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:48.980]   But there is gentleness and kindness and reconciliation and there is covenant commitment.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:49.980]   Don't be surprised."
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:57.200]   Gang, you're going to have conflict, but you want somebody who moves in conflict the way
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.080]   the God of grace moved towards you in your indifference to him.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:06.360]   I don't know who you think you are, but let me just close by telling you, you little migrant
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:12.120]   worker like me who is toiling with bloody fingers picking cotton, with just a slave
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:20.440]   master over you and there's no freedom that you have been redeemed and you have been brought
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.840]   into a relationship or can be brought into a relationship with the king.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.880]   The Lord stands at the door tonight and knocks and just says, "Come here.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   Come on.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880]   I can redeem you.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.400]   I'm the king.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   That's not the one that's power.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.880]   I can take care of him.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.160]   Just tell me you want out.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.040]   Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.720]   I'm not choosing you because you're beautiful.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.760]   I'm going to make you beautiful.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.680]   I'm the king and I'll make you mine."
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:55.920]   And then when he makes you yours, there's going to be moments when you don't walk perfectly,
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.040]   but he's just going to say, "Remind yourself of who I am.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.280]   Surround yourself with others who say, 'Rehearse to me again who the one you loved is.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.440]   I know you just moved away and said, 'But come back home.'"
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.680]   Don't run lovers through your bed.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.000]   You might have a moment of indifference.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   We all do.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.600]   But if you've gone to deep, dark places, read the book of Hosea.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.320]   He's still there.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:21.160]   But it should concern you if you're taking advantage of that.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.720]   So if you've never come home, come home.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.700]   If you've been discouraged because you've left him briefly, come home.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:35.960]   If you know his love, don't yoke yourself to somebody who doesn't.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.920]   Be a person of commitment.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.080]   Listen, some of you guys are in relationships you need to not reconcile with because you're
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.160]   in a relationship with somebody who hasn't been reconciled to God.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.980]   Let them alone define God.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.600]   You keep walking with him.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.080]   When you found him, use the keys that he has given you in your relationship with you to
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.060]   make your relationship with one another work.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:04.160]   He adds no sorrow to those relationships, even though it's tough.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:09.240]   Father, I pray for my friends.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.720]   That they would see all the wisdom and the goodness of your way that we see in this story,
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.000]   not just a picture of beautiful love.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.680]   We see a picture of the most beautiful of loves.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.600]   That you are the noble shepherd king.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.160]   That you've redeemed our lives from the pit.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.880]   That you want us to delight in every gift you've given us, but you don't want us to
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.960]   find those gifts in a way that there's an aftertaste where we're chasing after things
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.920]   that look life-giving, but they lead to death.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.000]   No, Lord, save us from that.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.120]   Redeem us from the one who lies to us and wants us to focus on the reward and not the
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.280]   ultimate result of death that so many of us have tasted.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.440]   Oh, bring people to you, Father, as we have rehearsed the kindness of who you are, as
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.680]   we do it again now through song.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.400]   Would you bring some lovers home to you?
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.280]   And for those of us that have grown a little indifferent, thank you that we're here again
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.560]   together tonight.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:06.360]   That we can awake from our stupor, be reminded of who you are so that others say, "Hey, do
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.160]   you think that God that you're so secure with, you think he could love me?"
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.600]   And that we can say, "Oh, yes."
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.360]   And then, Father, help us to be wise.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.160]   Help us to only yoke with those that are devoted to this kind of love.
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.240]   And work through conflict the way you worked through it with us.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.760]   Awaken our indifference.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.040]   Save us in our sin.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.200]   yourself in our love. In Jesus' name.
