1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,080
 Love it, keep going.

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,220
 Hello, friends in the room.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,020
 Hello, Fort Worth and friends in Houston.

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,880
 I am gonna start with a story

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,180
 about some of my college experience, how I landed.

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,000
 It'll tell us where we're going.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,080
 I was 18 years old.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,500
 It was my second semester of my senior year in high school

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,180
 and I was enrolled in the University of Texas.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,280
 If you, yeah, I love this.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,300
 And I was planning on going there.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,820
 I had a roommate lined up.

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,540
 I had a major that had been picked.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,780
 I was all set and I got a call from a coach

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,180
 at the University of Texas A&M.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,460
 Love it, didn't see that coming.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,740
 And he basically said, hey, I have an opportunity

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,500
 that I want you to be a part of

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,100
 and it involves our track team.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,260
 And I'm thinking, wait a second, track?

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,020
 I didn't play, I never did track in my whole life.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,700
 Are you sure you have the right number right now?

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,020
 And the thing involved, and I think Chad is gonna hand me

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,220
 exactly what it involved, and it was an opportunity

26
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,820
 where he basically said, I want to give you a chance

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,060
 to be on our track team and it involved this.

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,100
 Now, what is this?

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,060
 A giant toothpick, of course.

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,020
 That's not at all what it is.

31
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,300
 It involved something called the javelin.

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,860
 And I'm going, again, buddy, are you sure

33
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,140
 you have the right number?

34
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,780
 And he says, yeah, if you will come to A&M,

35
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,340
 I will teach you to throw the javelin.

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,000
 Apparently, because no one throws the javelin

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,860
 in this country, or very few people do,

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,980
 the way that they get people on their team

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,940
 is they recruit young 18-year-olds

40
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,700
 who have no idea what they're doing with their life.

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,220
 And they say, hey, if you come here,

42
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,980
 I will teach you to throw this,

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,140
 especially those who, I played baseball and football.

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,500
 So he was like, yeah, it'll be great.

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,640
 So anyways, the crazier thing, I end up going,

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,100
 I changed everything for this sport

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,220
 that I'd never been a part of.

48
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,220
 I didn't even know existed, this thing that was out there

49
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,100
 called javelin, and being on this track team.

50
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,740
 In other words, I had never once in my life dreamed

51
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,220
 about going to be a part of a track team

52
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,840
 and specifically throwing the javelin.

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,420
 When you're a little kid sitting around in class,

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,420
 you're like, oh, this is what I'm gonna do

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,020
 for college someday.

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,100
 Never did it across my mind, I'm gonna throw the javelin

57
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,180
 at Texas A&M.

58
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,940
 That never happened, and yet, all of a sudden,

59
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,060
 this thing that I had no idea about

60
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,160
 really defined my college experience.

61
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,340
 It changed everything.

62
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,060
 It changed where I was going to school.

63
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,020
 It changed what I studied, because the program

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,740
 that I was going to study at Texas,

65
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,340
 the A&M school was not as strong.

66
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,500
 It wasn't a good thing to study there.

67
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,740
 So it changed what I studied.

68
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,940
 It changed my schedule.

69
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,780
 It changed what I did with my time,

70
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,940
 because all of a sudden, now I'm a part of this team,

71
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,100
 and I'm a part of 80 other people

72
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,220
 who are on this track team, and each person

73
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,740
 does these different roles and different functions.

74
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,180
 It put me underneath this new authority

75
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,580
 of this new coaching staff that I was a part of.

76
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,080
 This thing that I didn't even know existed,

77
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,820
 javelin, all of a sudden really defined

78
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,040
 my experience in college, and it changed everything.

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,480
 The reason I start there is because tonight,

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,700
 we're gonna talk about something,

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,880
 and it is something that I think many of us in the room

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,580
 don't even know it fully exists,

83
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,660
 and don't even know why it's so important.

84
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,680
 It's this thing out there, and it's this decision

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,300
 that if you will make tonight, will define everything

86
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,220
 for the rest of your life.

87
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,120
 Or let me say it this way.

88
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,380
 If there was something tonight,

89
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,220
 or there's something we're gonna discuss tonight,

90
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,180
 that if you will decide to embrace this truth

91
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,960
 that we're gonna look at, it will shape

92
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,900
 the rest of your future.

93
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,080
 It will provide for you a place where you will be protected

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,060
 from sin for the rest of your life.

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,720
 It will provide a place where you will have

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,700
 deeper relationships than you've ever known before.

97
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,940
 It will provide a place where your relationship with God

98
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,380
 will be stronger and increasingly stronger.

99
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,500
 It will provide a place for you to experience

100
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,260
 and find your purpose.

101
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,020
 Maybe for the first time ever, you'll experience that.

102
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,820
 And all of this can take place by simply making a decision.

103
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,540
 You will set yourself to experience all of those things.

104
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,600
 What is the thing that you may not even know exists

105
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,500
 that may define, and if you will allow,

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,480
 is supposed to define everything?

107
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,500
 The local church.

108
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,220
 Being a part of the local church.

109
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,700
 In other words, it is in making the decision

110
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,500
 that I am going to not just, if I'm a Christian,

111
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,220
 and I'm speaking primarily to Christians

112
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,940
 in the room tonight, I'm not just going to attend church

113
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,960
 'cause I'm an adult and this is an adulting thing

114
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,900
 and I'm growing up and I gotta start going to church.

115
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,340
 I am going to be the church, and one of the components

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,180
 of being the church is being a part of a local church

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,560
 and a local expression, and if you will make the decision

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,940
 to connect with a local gathering, that will be the thing

119
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,380
 that shapes the world your children grow up in.

120
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,720
 It will shape the person that you marry

121
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,940
 because you won't end up marrying crazy Sally

122
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,660
 because there'll be people in your life,

123
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,860
 if your name's Sally, I apologize,

124
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,060
 or people in your life who will be like,

125
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,180
 hey, she's crazy Sally, don't marry her.

126
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,700
 You'll have people in your life who will speak it,

127
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,100
 it will shape so much of the rest of your life

128
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,260
 if you will just get this one thing,

129
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,980
 and here's why this is so important.

130
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,540
 Most of you are not connected to a local church.

131
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,380
 The vast majority of this room, we know.

132
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,280
 You may attend a place, you may attend the porch

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,260
 on Tuesdays, you may go to Watermark on Sundays,

134
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,380
 or the Village, or IBC, or Prestiwood,

135
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,140
 or any number of different places,

136
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,860
 but you are not connected and a member of a local church,

137
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,620
 and you are forfeiting the primary thing God says

138
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,600
 is the vehicle.

139
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,020
 If you connect with it, that's the thing that I use

140
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,780
 to change you and to change the world.

141
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,320
 And so tonight, we're gonna look at the scripture

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,860
 and discuss really this topic of being connected

143
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,060
 to the local church.

144
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,180
 My goal, let me get this really clear

145
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,580
 in case I can't keep your attention

146
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,420
 and you start counting things up in the air

147
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,300
 and you're like, is there coffee out in the lobby?

148
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,980
 I want every single person here to become,

149
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,400
 if you're a follower of Jesus, a Christian.

150
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,640
 If that's who you are, I'm talking to you,

151
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,700
 a member of a local church,

152
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,740
 or obedient to what the scriptures teach

153
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,000
 would be another way of saying that.

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,340
 And so if you're right now going,

155
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,920
 oh, I just got out of college, I'm not yet a member,

156
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,180
 I'm talking to you.

157
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,420
 Or if you're going, I've been out of college

158
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,180
 for like 15 years, I'm still not a member,

159
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,460
 I'm talking to you.

160
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,220
 If you are not a member of a local church,

161
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,340
 whether that's here or another one,

162
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,300
 that you would connect to a local church.

163
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,480
 So we're gonna look at three reasons

164
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,180
 why the scripture teaches that you and I,

165
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,040
 it is imperative, it is a command for Christians.

166
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,860
 Again, this is for Christians.

167
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,980
 So if you're not a follower of Christ,

168
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,060
 you'll just have kind of a window

169
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,380
 into what the Christian life

170
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,980
 and living out the Christian life looks like

171
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,060
 and what specifically being a part of the church

172
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,100
 in a local church looks like.

173
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,060
 The three reasons we're gonna cover tonight

174
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,940
 as it relates to why it's so crucial

175
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,620
 for you to be a part of a local church are these.

176
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,780
 It is at the local church where you surround yourself

177
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,820
 with God's people, you submit to godly leadership,

178
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,800
 and you serve on God's mission.

179
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,940
 It is there that you surround yourself with godly people,

180
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,420
 you submit to godly leadership,

181
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,460
 and you serve on his mission.

182
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,620
 In other words, without a local church,

183
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,100
 you cannot do any of those,

184
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,980
 all of which are commands in the New Testament

185
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,500
 from the God who loves you and wants to lead you

186
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,460
 for the rest of your life to the abundant life

187
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,820
 he created you to experience.

188
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,020
 So we're gonna look at the first one

189
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,220
 and walk through all of these.

190
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,060
 So the first one of surrounding,

191
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,940
 why is the local church so important?

192
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,820
 Because it is there that you surround yourself

193
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
 with God's people.

194
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,760
 You're gonna surround yourself

195
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,060
 with lots of people in this world,

196
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,220
 whether that's your family, whether that's at work,

197
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,940
 all the different time you're around different groups.

198
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,980
 Maybe you're in a bowling club,

199
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,040
 I don't know what you're involved in,

200
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 but the local church is to be the place

201
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,340
 where you're surrounded by God's people,

202
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,420
 by men and women who speak into your life

203
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,060
 and push you on in your faith.

204
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,780
 The author of Hebrews addresses this in chapter 10.

205
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,380
 This is gonna be kinda topical.

206
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
 We'll do three points and look at scriptures

207
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,860
 that inform each of those ideas in the scripture.

208
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,700
 The author of Hebrews is gonna talk to us

209
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,740
 about this first idea.

210
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,780
 The local church is where we surround ourselves

211
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,140
 with God's people.

212
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,680
 And he says this in chapter 10.

213
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,140
 If you have a Bible, you can flip over there.

214
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,740
 If not, it'll be on the screens.

215
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,580
 But he says this in chapter 10,

216
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,020
 and the book of Hebrews is such a great book for us

217
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,380
 because it's written to a group of new believers.

218
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,700
 They just put their faith in Jesus,

219
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,140
 they're trying to figure this thing out,

220
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,540
 and they're trying to decide,

221
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,960
 or discover what it looks like to live out this new faith

222
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,800
 that I have.

223
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,500
 Persecution is going on, and so a lot of them are like,

224
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,460
 do I really believe this?

225
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,500
 Should I keep going on?

226
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,620
 Should I keep pressing on?

227
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,080
 And the author of Hebrews writes,

228
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,620
 and he gives them a message saying,

229
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,100
 don't lose hope, don't let go,

230
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,580
 continue forward in your faith,

231
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,300
 and here's one of the ways that you make sure

232
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,940
 that your faith and your future is protected.

233
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,180
 It's by surrounding yourself.

234
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,300
 Listen to what he says.

235
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,340
 Verse 23 of chapter 10.

236
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,540
 Surrounding yourself by God's people.

237
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,540
 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess.

238
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,660
 For he who promised is faithful,

239
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,700
 and let us consider how we may spur one another

240
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,840
 on towards love and good deeds,

241
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,740
 not giving up meeting together,

242
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,700
 as some are in the habit of doing,

243
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,580
 but encouraging one another,

244
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,020
 and all the more as you see the day approaching,

245
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,560
 or Christ returning.

246
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,400
 I'm gonna read it again,

247
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,860
 and look to see if you can see anything jumping out.

248
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,580
 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess.

249
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,900
 For he who promised is faithful,

250
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,900
 and let us consider how we may spur one another

251
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,540
 on towards love and good deeds,

252
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,220
 not giving up meeting together,

253
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,560
 as some are in the habit of doing,

254
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,060
 but encouraging one another,

255
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,780
 and all the more as you see the day approaching.

256
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,280
 What's the author of Hebrews pointing at?

257
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,220
 How many times does he use these plural expressions?

258
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,060
 What is he saying?

259
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,940
 The Christian life is a team sport.

260
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,540
 The Christian faith is meant to be lived together.

261
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,740
 It's about we, not about me.

262
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,820
 The Christian life has always been this thing

263
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,060
 where we come together.

264
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,780
 Even what he's telling them as it relates

265
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,560
 to hey, holding on to hope.

266
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,220
 He's saying that the way that we hold on to hope

267
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,220
 in a world that feels hopelessly broken is together.

268
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,180
 Christianity is a team sport.

269
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,380
 It's always been meant to be lived together.

270
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,900
 The mentality that can hit any of us at any point in life

271
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,980
 where we just feel discouraged,

272
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,020
 where we just feel down,

273
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,220
 where we feel filled with doubt,

274
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,180
 where we just feel like giving up.

275
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,140
 That's why the author of Hebrews is writing and saying,

276
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,660
 look, this is a we thing.

277
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,860
 This is where we lock arms.

278
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,660
 The body of Christ comes together,

279
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,540
 and it's always been a place where it's not just you alone,

280
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,060
 you and Jesus all by yourself,

281
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,980
 but you come together, and you lock arms,

282
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,400
 and you say, I'm not letting you go,

283
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,060
 and I need you to not let me go,

284
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,740
 because sometimes I wanna go after crazy Sally.

285
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,460
 Sometimes I wanna go after crazy decisions

286
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,700
 that I know are gonna hurt me,

287
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,120
 but they still look good to me.

288
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,220
 I need your help.

289
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,140
 I need to come together.

290
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,740
 Sometimes I'm just gonna feel overwhelmed with doubt,

291
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,260
 and the author of Hebrews says the way

292
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,420
 that you maintain hope in a hopelessly broken world

293
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,580
 is we, not me.

294
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,000
 It's always been meant to be done together,

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,240
 that you are to connect to a local church,

296
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,180
 and one of the main reasons the Bible says

297
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,900
 is because you are meant to have these deep relationships

298
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,380
 with others in your life who spur you on

299
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,500
 towards love and good deeds.

300
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,340
 You can't do it alone,

301
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,260
 and you never intended to.

302
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,140
 And from the very beginning,

303
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,380
 the Christian church has always been where we lock arms

304
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,060
 because we're a bunch of broken, sinful people.

305
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,100
 That's the requirement to get in,

306
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,780
 and if you get a bunch of sinners together,

307
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,980
 of course you're gonna have crazies in there,

308
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,140
 and of course bad decisions are made,

309
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,900
 and so we spur, and we help,

310
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,300
 and hold one another accountable.

311
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,140
 It's always been meant to be lived together.

312
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,380
 It's at the heart of Christianity,

313
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,020
 and that's why having a local church,

314
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,260
 because where else is that gonna take place?

315
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,420
 It's always been a together thing.

316
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,980
 This is why the mentality of like, hey, I'm good, man.

317
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,860
 Look, I'm not a part of a church,

318
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,220
 but I got me and Jesus, me and Jesus are good right now.

319
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,520
 You know the Bible says that's not good?

320
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,940
 The very first thing that God says is not good.

321
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,980
 Anyone know what it is?

322
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,180
 In Genesis 2, 18, the world was just created.

323
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,160
 Everything's perfect.

324
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,260
 There's no sin, no apple, none of that's taken place yet.

325
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,620
 In the world, Adam is hanging out with God.

326
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,260
 You would think like, oh man, that's amazing.

327
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,980
 If anyone could ever say, hey, I'm good,

328
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,900
 I got me and God, we're in perfect relationship,

329
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,480
 there's no sin, I'm just hanging out naked with the animals,

330
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,240
 everything's going great, and the Bible says this.

331
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,820
 Before sin, God looks down and he says,

332
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,460
 it's been like 15 minutes, and he's like, this is not good.

333
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,300
 Here's what it says, Genesis 2, 18.

334
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,700
 The Lord God said, before any sin had entered,

335
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,540
 it is not good for man to be alone.

336
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,720
 I will make a helper suitable for him.

337
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,640
 In other words, it's not good just God and Adam.

338
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,760
 There has to be a human relationship involved.

339
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,200
 If anyone could ever say, I mean, think about that.

340
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,960
 Adam is in perfect relationship.

341
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,400
 Adam, arguably, you would think would be the only guy

342
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,900
 who'd be like, yeah, it's me and Jesus, everything's great,

343
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,240
 and Jesus, who's in the beginning, we're told,

344
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,920
 is like, hey, time out, not good, we're all alone here.

345
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,580
 He needs someone else involved.

346
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,080
 A man alone with God in the garden,

347
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,280
 and God says he needs human relationship.

348
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,000
 He's designed and created to experience that community.

349
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
 Where does that take place?

350
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,680
 At the church.

351
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,180
 The other phrase that flies in the face

352
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,480
 of the New Testament idea of like,

353
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,000
 you're meant to be a part of the church,

354
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 is this idea of like, yeah, I love Jesus,

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,360
 but I don't like the church.

356
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,400
 Please don't ever say that again, if nothing else,

357
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,520
 because how insane that statement is.

358
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,740
 The Bible says the church is the bride

359
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,620
 or the wife of Christ.

360
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,960
 You following me on this?

361
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,360
 In other words, when you say, hey, I love Jesus,

362
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,440
 but I don't like Jesus' wife, think how that is gonna go.

363
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,080
 Like, what husband, if you came up to me,

364
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,520
 and you're like, yeah, David, I love you, man.

365
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,040
 Hey, I'm just not a big fan of your wife.

366
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,440
 I mean, what am I, be like, I'm about to swing at you.

367
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
 What husband would not, what husband would be like,

368
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,980
 hey, man, it's cool, yeah, dude, ah, I agree.

369
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,080
 What husband would say that?

370
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,520
 (congregation laughing)

371
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,320
 Do you think Christ, the perfect husband,

372
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 is just gonna be like, yeah, that's fine, great,

373
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,200
 you don't have to.

374
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 Then no, we're always meant to be a part of it.

375
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,500
 We're always meant to be together.

376
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,540
 That's the essence of church.

377
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,760
 It's not dissimilar from, really, the Christian life,

378
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,520
 and being together is not dissimilar

379
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,320
 from like, when I was throwing javelin.

380
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,360
 If you came up after this message,

381
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,400
 and for the person who says, I'm a Christian,

382
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,040
 but I'm not connected to a local church,

383
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,520
 you are like a person who comes up after this message

384
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,600
 and is like, you threw javelin in college.

385
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,560
 Hey, I did too, and I respond with, oh, man, awesome,

386
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,000
 where did you throw javelin?

387
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,120
 You're like, just in my backyard, you know, it was great.

388
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,680
 I was throwing it up in the air, and it was awesome,

389
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,080
 and it's like, you are not a javelin thrower.

390
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,640
 You are a man with a weird hobby, is what you are.

391
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,600
 That's not a javelin, that's what a Christian is

392
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,360
 who doesn't have a local church.

393
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,600
 You following me?

394
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
 You're like the person who's just throwing the javelin

395
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
 in his backyard up in the air

396
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
 as though that's how you throw it.

397
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,980
 You are that person.

398
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,760
 It was always designed, and you were always intended

399
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,160
 to live together because, and the author of Hebrews here

400
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 says because we live in a broken world that's just hard.

401
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,840
 We live in a world where we just need one another,

402
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,360
 like we need encouragement.

403
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,680
 Who are you gonna turn to in life when cancer strikes,

404
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
 when, honestly, when you just walk through a breakup,

405
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,520
 how horrible are breakups, even if you do them all right?

406
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,000
 You're gonna turn to Margarita night?

407
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,560
 You're gonna turn to Bluebell?

408
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,380
 Who are you gonna turn to?

409
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,000
 You're gonna turn to friends that just push you

410
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
 in a terrible direction?

411
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,120
 How are you gonna make sure the breakup doesn't break you?

412
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
 And it's the body of Christ coming around you saying,

413
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
 hey, I'm gonna walk with you.

414
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,360
 I know what you're going through.

415
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,400
 I'm here for your pain, whether that's a breakup,

416
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,800
 maybe it's a layoff from a job, whatever it is,

417
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,080
 I'm not letting you go, I'm here for you.

418
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,460
 And the author of Hebrews says that's the local church

419
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,600
 that's always been intended to be this way.

420
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,720
 And where are you gonna find this?

421
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,400
 Like, you're not gonna find this at work.

422
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,720
 You're not gonna find this at the gym.

423
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,160
 At work, you're gonna find,

424
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,440
 you're lucky if you get a 401k and a dental plan.

425
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,300
 You're not gonna have people who are gonna speak

426
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,120
 the words of life to you, who are gonna say,

427
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
 look, I'm gonna remind you of truth

428
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,200
 when you are running from it.

429
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,280
 I'm not gonna let you go.

430
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,960
 I'm gonna come pray for you when you don't even wanna pray.

431
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,240
 I'm just gonna, you just sit there

432
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,500
 and I'm gonna pray for you.

433
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,420
 We're gonna pray together and I'm not leaving.

434
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,640
 Where are you gonna find, at the gym

435
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,840
 with your spin instructor?

436
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 These relationships are, they exist inside of the church.

437
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,560
 And it's there that you and I discover them

438
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,920
 and we're created to experience them.

439
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,760
 The second reason it's so crucial that you connect

440
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,780
 to a local body is probably going to be the one

441
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,700
 that everyone resists the most, and it's the second one.

442
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,880
 It's there that we submit to godly leadership.

443
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,140
 Everyone's favorite S word, submit.

444
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,820
 Submit to godly leadership.

445
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,280
 The Bible says this in Hebrews 13.

446
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,680
 Obey your leaders and submit to them,

447
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,800
 for they are keeping watch over your souls

448
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,040
 as those who will have to give an account.

449
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,720
 This is terrifying.

450
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,480
 Let them do this with joy and not with groaning,

451
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,400
 for that would be of no advantage to you.

452
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,840
 Obey your leaders and submit to them.

453
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,920
 I want you to think about something.

454
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,920
 If you're a Christian, how do you obey this verse

455
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,540
 without being a part of a local church?

456
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,240
 Just obey any Christian leaders?

457
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,240
 Like, if you're a Christian and you got leadership gifts,

458
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,400
 I guess I'm supposed to obey you.

459
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
 What should I do today?

460
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,840
 What are you to do if you don't have a local church?

461
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
 How can you obey that verse?

462
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
 Of course it's not all leaders.

463
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,020
 It's clear he's speaking about the leadership

464
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,800
 of a local church that you are to be a part of,

465
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
 to be led and cared for and shepherded,

466
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,780
 and they're gonna give an account to God

467
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,880
 for how they do so.

468
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,600
 But you can't obey this passage

469
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,700
 if you're not connected to a local church.

470
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,280
 The elders that are here, if you are here,

471
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,440
 I wrote just in my notes,

472
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,560
 man, you have got some godly elders who are not perfect,

473
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,460
 but they are purposeful,

474
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,240
 and they are men who are leading this flock,

475
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,360
 and they will give an account before God

476
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,040
 for every person who is a member here.

477
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,000
 But if you attend here,

478
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,480
 that does not include you necessarily.

479
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,860
 If you are a member and you've committed here,

480
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,920
 and if you're a Christian

481
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,640
 and you're not a part of a local church,

482
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,840
 or you're not a member,

483
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,960
 who's gonna give an account for you

484
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,600
 when you stand before God?

485
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
 Like, you'll give an account for yourself,

486
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,940
 but when God's like, all right,

487
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,760
 and David, where are your elders?

488
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,120
 And it's like, well,

489
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
 I don't know that I really had any.

490
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,520
 What church were you a part of?

491
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,560
 Well, I kind of rotated.

492
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,600
 I went here a couple times,

493
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,560
 I went here a few times,

494
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,400
 and it's like, yeah,

495
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,800
 but which one did you become a part of?

496
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,960
 Well, I'm not sure that I ever became a part of one,

497
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,480
 but I did listen to Matt Chandler,

498
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,360
 and Francis Chan, and John Piper a lot.

499
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,800
 It's gonna be like, Piper, you know this guy, huh?

500
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,840
 Back of the line, that's not gonna happen at all.

501
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,920
 But who's gonna give an account

502
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,160
 when you stand before God?

503
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,120
 Even the answer that I won't have any elders

504
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
 could be an indictment against the fact

505
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,520
 that you weren't, in this area, obedient,

506
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,360
 and you didn't experience, because of that,

507
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,560
 the shepherding and protection that comes.

508
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,480
 The reason God wants you to submit and yield to elders

509
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,000
 is because he has placed leadership there

510
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,460
 to care for, to love, to protect.

511
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,180
 So you're not just someone who comes in,

512
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,560
 and attends, and disappears,

513
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,760
 but you're someone who's known and connected.

514
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,280
 And I know a lot of you in this room,

515
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,200
 even that word submit and obey

516
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,120
 can bring up bad memories or bad feelings

517
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,800
 because the experience you've had of church

518
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,840
 wasn't a good one.

519
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,480
 And a couple things on that.

520
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,920
 One, there is no perfect church.

521
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,760
 It was filled, and the experience, if you had a bad one,

522
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,960
 it's not surprising because the church

523
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,160
 is full of imperfect people.

524
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,520
 It's a requirement to get in.

525
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,360
 And the second one is that's why it's so important

526
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,640
 to be a part of a place with godly leadership.

527
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,040
 And so if you've given up on being a part of a church,

528
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,640
 that is insane logic.

529
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,240
 Like, that's like giving up on the doctor

530
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,800
 if you had a bad doctor experience.

531
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
 You think about that?

532
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,120
 It's like, look, I am done with the whole medical community.

533
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,000
 I am out of here.

534
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,720
 This guy was horrible.

535
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,380
 If you had a bad experience in the church,

536
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,220
 it's the same thing.

537
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,120
 You don't give up on the church.

538
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,040
 You connect to a place with godly leadership,

539
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,300
 and you yield and submit underneath that.

540
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,760
 Underneath, and by submission,

541
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,560
 like just to bring real clarity to that,

542
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,880
 'cause like, what, I'm supposed to submit?

543
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,840
 Submitting like here at Watermark is going,

544
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,880
 oh, I'm gonna be a part of a community group.

545
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
 I'm gonna serve somewhere.

546
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,580
 Those are the ways that we submit or we yield to.

547
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,160
 We follow along the shepherding that God has put in place.

548
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,840
 The reason elders are crucial

549
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,280
 is because they provide the protection for your life.

550
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,880
 As you walk through this life, protection from what?

551
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,300
 Two things.

552
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,400
 The first is yourself, because you crazy too.

553
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,320
 It's true.

554
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,200
 Like, the first is all of us, as broken sinners,

555
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,140
 we're prone to wander, we're prone to go off,

556
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,500
 and it's having elders in place.

557
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,160
 There's a process for someone to say,

558
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 hey, I'm coming, I'm going to meet with you,

559
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,520
 I'm gonna pursue you, I'm gonna care for you.

560
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
 Anytime you've already said and you declared,

561
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,840
 I wanna be a part of this church body,

562
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,960
 I wanna follow Jesus, and so if you're unwilling to do that,

563
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,080
 I'm going to be with you, talk with you,

564
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,340
 meet with you, pray with you,

565
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,560
 show you in God's word how that's done,

566
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,640
 so that you don't just wander off.

567
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,340
 Like, all of us are just prone to do that,

568
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,680
 to wander off, to move from our faith.

569
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,680
 Us on the stage are prone to wander off,

570
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,960
 that's why we need community and elders in our life.

571
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,320
 We're all like one second away from a bad decision.

572
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,620
 My son, I have a nine week old baby,

573
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,320
 so we're not sleeping a lot right now,

574
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,760
 and he is like just a little milk monster,

575
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,560
 and he's doing one of three things at all times,

576
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,900
 sleeping, pooping, and eating,

577
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,680
 and I tell my wife, like, he is always

578
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,920
 about six seconds away from a bad attitude.

579
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,900
 If he wakes up and he does not get milk,

580
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,060
 and I want it now, ah, everything goes haywire,

581
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,700
 and everything goes crazy, because he's going,

582
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,840
 I want it now, I want it now.

583
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,080
 It was like the Lord was, I don't know if this was

584
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,160
 the Lord speaking, or just a thought in my head,

585
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 but as I was thinking about that, you never do,

586
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,900
 or you do, maybe you do, I don't know,

587
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,980
 let's get back to that.

588
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,200
 (congregation laughing)

589
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
 As I was thinking about that, it was like the Lord

590
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,900
 was like, David, you are six seconds away

591
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,720
 from a bad attitude, have you noticed that?

592
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
 At any point in time, I can move and make it

593
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
 six seconds away from a bad decision.

594
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
 I can be leaving Bible study and be like,

595
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,400
 man, Lord, you're awesome, amazing,

596
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,080
 get in traffic and be like, oh my gosh,

597
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,100
 what is going on here, people?

598
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,760
 Drive the car the speed limit, and all of a sudden,

599
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,800
 everything's falling apart, and if you're,

600
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,640
 I'm getting a lot of judgment, wait 'til you're

601
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,400
 in that parking lot tonight, and you are about

602
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,640
 to leave Bible study and experience it yourself,

603
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,880
 but it's the same way.

604
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
 I know that all of us in the room can experience that,

605
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,420
 or many of us, maybe you're a little more stable.

606
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,580
 (congregation laughing)

607
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,140
 Where you're like, God is so good right now,

608
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,380
 why would he break up with me, where are you, Lord?

609
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,500
 In a second, any of us can be six seconds,

610
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,340
 and less than that from a bad decision,

611
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,060
 a bad mindset that can lead us down a path,

612
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,940
 and those are humorous ones, but the reality is,

613
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,220
 the ones that we can walk towards because of the sin

614
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,460
 inside of us are not humorous at all,

615
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,160
 and so having shepherds there to protect us from ourself,

616
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,080
 it's not only protection from ourself

617
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 that we find in the local church,

618
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,180
 we find protection from an enemy.

619
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,480
 The Bible teaches that you and I are at war,

620
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,320
 there's this spiritual war going on,

621
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
 and we have an enemy whose name is Satan,

622
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,800
 and he has come to destroy your life.

623
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,600
 He's come to get you to engage in whatever he can

624
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,280
 that will distract you from pursuing Christ,

625
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,080
 from pursuing eternal things,

626
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,800
 from not being a part of the church.

627
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,660
 He's come to kill and destroy,

628
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,040
 and this is what 1 Peter tells us about that enemy

629
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,660
 and why we need elders to protect us in our life.

630
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,720
 Written by Peter in chapter five, verse eight,

631
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,520
 he says this, "Your enemy, the devil,

632
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,880
 "prows around like a roaring lion

633
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,040
 "looking for someone to devour."

634
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,360
 That Peter, who wrote at a time,

635
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,600
 and he's writing spiritually,

636
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,520
 hey, we have this enemy, Satan, the devil,

637
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,400
 who is trying to destroy your life,

638
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,680
 looking for someone who we can pick off,

639
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,520
 who's isolated, who we can pick off from the flock

640
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,660
 and devour.

641
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,680
 Peter, who had seen Christians,

642
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,320
 not spiritually get devoured,

643
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,200
 physically get devoured,

644
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,700
 likely, during the persecution that's going on

645
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,720
 that we know was going on,

646
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,940
 Peter looks at that and he goes,

647
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,220
 oh my gosh, in the same way,

648
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,000
 that's what Satan is out to do to you and to me,

649
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
 and if you don't believe it,

650
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,420
 you're likely headed towards the path of that happening,

651
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,360
 that he's out to devour.

652
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,480
 I don't even fully know what that means,

653
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,160
 but I feel like I've seen it.

654
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,920
 Devour faith in people's lives,

655
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,680
 devour marriages,

656
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,560
 devour their financial world,

657
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,720
 devour their future,

658
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,020
 devour their relationship with their children,

659
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,280
 and one of the reasons we need elders in a local church

660
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,880
 is because it offers and provides the protection

661
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,920
 from ourselves and from an enemy

662
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,240
 where we help one another,

663
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,080
 shepherd one another,

664
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,400
 and care for one another

665
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,160
 so that we are underneath that protection,

666
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,720
 and we are most vulnerable

667
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,000
 when we're isolated or alone or not connected.

668
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,820
 If you are in the room and you're not connected,

669
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,900
 you're most vulnerable,

670
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,360
 and you will continue to be vulnerable

671
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,080
 if you don't have,

672
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,900
 and you're a Christian

673
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,200
 and you don't have others in your life

674
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,600
 who can care,

675
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,680
 come alongside,

676
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,880
 encourage.

677
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,480
 The final reason why the local church is so crucial

678
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,220
 is because it's there that we serve on God's mission.

679
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,340
 It's there that you serve with the gifts he's given you

680
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,020
 as a part of God's mission.

681
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,880
 This is what Paul writes in Romans chapter 12,

682
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,020
 starting in verse four.

683
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,880
 For just as each of us has one body with many members,

684
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
 so each of us has a body and members are like,

685
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
 oh my, I got hands, I got feet, I got legs,

686
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,720
 and these members don't all have the same function,

687
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,060
 so I don't just have like five legs.

688
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,080
 And so in Christ, though many form one body,

689
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,760
 so though we in Christ,

690
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,640
 though many we form one body,

691
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,560
 and each member belongs to all the others.

692
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,540
 What are you talking about, Paul?

693
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,440
 We're all different and it's like we're this body,

694
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,680
 that's what the body of Christ is,

695
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,920
 where each person is a hand or a foot

696
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,740
 or an eye or something different.

697
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,080
 Yes, and what I mean by that

698
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
 is I'm talking about their gifts,

699
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,400
 who God has made them,

700
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,920
 says this in verse six.

701
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,240
 We each have different gifts

702
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,240
 according to the grace given to each of us.

703
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,000
 God made you different than he made me.

704
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,280
 And he wired and brings together this beautiful gathering

705
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,380
 of different men and different women,

706
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,100
 each with different gifts, different spiritual gifts,

707
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,240
 different natural giftings, different personalities,

708
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,600
 and he brings them together to form the body of Christ.

709
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
 And it's more perfect when they're united.

710
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,840
 It would be less perfect if they were all feet,

711
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,620
 if it was just one big foot.

712
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,560
 It's more perfect by the complementary different parts

713
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,400
 that make it up.

714
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,740
 And he lists out some of those gifts.

715
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,800
 We each have different gifts.

716
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,440
 If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy.

717
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,800
 And prophesying in the New Testament, quickly,

718
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,760
 is different than the prophets in the Old Testament.

719
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,880
 Prophets in the Old Testament

720
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,640
 would speak foretelling the future.

721
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,760
 Prophetic gift in the New Testament

722
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,020
 is primarily truth-telling, like boldness,

723
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,520
 speaking directly, speaking intentionally.

724
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,800
 JP has the gift of prophetic things,

725
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,740
 where he's just like, look,

726
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,120
 break up with your boyfriend now, okay?

727
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,920
 He's not a believer, and don't call me again.

728
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,160
 I don't know if anyone's calling him.

729
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,720
 But something where you speak boldly, that's prophetic.

730
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,160
 That would be a prophetic example.

731
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,280
 And I know there's gonna be people upset about that.

732
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,720
 I'll read the verse that informs that.

733
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,920
 First Corinthians 14.

734
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,720
 Paul, again, what is prophecy?

735
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,400
 It's a person that speaks.

736
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,080
 First Corinthians 14, three.

737
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,760
 The one who prophesies, what do they do?

738
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,840
 They speak for the people for their strengthening,

739
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,360
 for their encouraging, and for their comfort.

740
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,040
 It's this bold, that's what prophetic is.

741
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,880
 Moving on.

742
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
 Okay, if it's that, then do that.

743
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,840
 If it's serving, then serve.

744
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,020
 If it's teaching, then teach.

745
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,160
 If it is to encourage, then encourage.

746
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,560
 If it is giving, then give generously.

747
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,280
 If it's lead, do so diligently.

748
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,520
 If it's show mercy, then do it cheerfully.

749
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,320
 Whatever it is, it's not an exhaustive lift.

750
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,240
 He basically says, look,

751
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,440
 everybody has been given these different gifts.

752
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,140
 God made you different from me.

753
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,520
 And your gift is just as valuable as mine,

754
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,680
 and the church is a place where we come together

755
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,680
 and we serve God's mission by using whatever way

756
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,400
 God made you to build up the body of Christ,

757
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,680
 serving with your gift here,

758
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,620
 and to be a part of the mission

759
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,900
 of reaching the world for Christ.

760
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,080
 The church is a place where you bring your gifts.

761
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,960
 If you're artistic and you're good at art,

762
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,900
 maybe you're good at video,

763
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,640
 maybe you're good at any list of different things,

764
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
 maybe you're good at just leading,

765
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,200
 maybe you're an entrepreneur.

766
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,800
 The church, and this is so huge,

767
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,480
 because for so long, this is,

768
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,280
 I don't know why this has always been absent

769
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,780
 for so many churches in our country.

770
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,860
 It's a place where you, just like God made you,

771
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,800
 you come in and you go, this is what I can do,

772
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,820
 this is what I'm gonna offer,

773
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,160
 this is what I'm gonna dream.

774
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,920
 I feel like we could take the next level

775
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
 as it relates to artistic gifts.

776
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,520
 The church, as much as anybody in this world,

777
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,960
 any organization in this world,

778
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,800
 they need to be the best social media people of all time.

779
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,680
 They need to be the best at encouraging

780
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,960
 and reaching the lost, producing content

781
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,840
 that's gonna be excellent, because you know what?

782
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,680
 Coca-Cola's selling stuff and they're doing it for money.

783
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,960
 We're doing it for the souls of people.

784
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,280
 The church comes together, your gifts, my gifts,

785
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,440
 we all come together and we go,

786
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,560
 no gift is better than the other,

787
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,280
 we're just gonna put 'em all on the table and go,

788
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,840
 God, use us, do whatever you want to with us.

789
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,600
 It's not about me, it's not about what I like,

790
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,760
 we're gonna come together and we're gonna reach the world

791
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,520
 for Christ, and you can golf clap all day long,

792
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,320
 but that's the purpose for which you were created.

793
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,480
 And if you're sitting on the sideline with gifts,

794
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,400
 you are wasting your talent.

795
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,360
 You are wasting what God has given you.

796
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,080
 Some of you guys are leaders out there,

797
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,760
 and man, we need godly men, we need godly leaders

798
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,480
 who are gonna go, hey, we're gonna take Uptown by storm.

799
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
 We're gonna help people reject the lie

800
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,920
 that the next hangover is really worth it.

801
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,320
 Are you serious?

802
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,280
 How much better is the message of hope

803
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,080
 and life that we offer to the world?

804
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,960
 And are we gonna hold onto our gifts and be like,

805
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,560
 yeah, I'm pretty detail-oriented,

806
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 but I'll just work on these expel spreadsheets by myself.

807
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,440
 Are we gonna provide them to the body of Christ?

808
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,480
 Man, God has made you for something

809
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,520
 so much bigger than yourself, and that something

810
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,080
 is being a part of the greatest movement

811
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,300
 the world's ever seen, the body of Christ.

812
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,240
 The thing that I don't care where you're working right now,

813
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,280
 way outlasts what you're doing.

814
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,280
 In 1,000 years, Coca-Cola will be no more,

815
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,360
 and if you're like, eh, they could hang around, likely.

816
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,640
 I mean, let's be honest, for real, 1,000 years ago,

817
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,800
 what was going on 1,000 years?

818
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,320
 But you know what will be around?

819
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,960
 The church, the body of Christ.

820
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,720
 We're actually promised by Jesus

821
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,960
 the gates of death will not be able to stop it.

822
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,400
 The gates of death have stopped a lot of things,

823
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,080
 empires, people, but they cannot stop

824
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,720
 and will not stop the church.

825
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,360
 Will you come and be a part of it?

826
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,320
 It's a place where you serve God's mission.

827
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,140
 You're a part of building up

828
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,800
 and being involved with God's people.

829
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,120
 There's so many in this group.

830
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,920
 I love the porch because our volunteers are unbelievable.

831
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,780
 If we told you how much our volunteers did,

832
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,860
 you'd be like, what do you guys do all day?

833
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,480
 Because they just get it.

834
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,080
 They're going, hey, we're gonna make this place better.

835
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,360
 We're gonna make this city more covered

836
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,780
 and reached for Christ.

837
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,760
 Volunteers like Lance Thrillkill,

838
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,480
 who's been a part of this ministry for a long time,

839
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,680
 and honestly, there's so many,

840
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,920
 it's almost hard to mention 'em.

841
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,760
 Lance was throwing parties in Dallas for a living.

842
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,960
 That's what he was doing.

843
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,840
 Lance came on, became a volunteer,

844
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
 became a part of just throwing parties

845
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
 for prodigals to come home.

846
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,400
 He's going, the church should be the most alive,

847
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,560
 fun, engaging place in the world.

848
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
 So many places, people don't like to go to church.

849
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,280
 You should be dying inside until you get to church.

850
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,920
 You're like, I can't wait to get there.

851
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,760
 That's what it should be.

852
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,120
 So he's like, we're gonna throw parties here.

853
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,960
 Of course we are.

854
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,560
 Ryan Wall, who's an entrepreneur

855
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,200
 who has done so many different things

856
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,280
 and initiatives to be a part of

857
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,760
 reaching young adults for Christ.

858
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,920
 Started Unashamed, started a bunch of different things.

859
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,400
 Unashamed is that three-day in-town mission trip,

860
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,240
 and it's just led by a guy who wasn't on staff,

861
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,720
 who just said, we can go to Africa for mission trips,

862
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,400
 or we can live on mission in the city

863
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,360
 where we actually speak the same language.

864
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,120
 I feel like that's what we should do,

865
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,840
 and he just started this initiative.

866
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,320
 Jocelyn Jesus, who heads up our arts team

867
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,080
 with some other incredible artists,

868
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,160
 and they donate and give their time,

869
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,320
 not to just create like, oh, I like this drawing,

870
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,080
 this is fun, but to create artistic stuff

871
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,440
 that reaches young adults for Christ.

872
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,120
 And so many others who give their life

873
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,400
 and give their gifts for something

874
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,120
 way bigger than themselves.

875
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,600
 Will you jump in and be a part of getting on the team?

876
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,720
 In conclusion, the reason why a local church is so crucial

877
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,160
 is because it is there that you surround yourself

878
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,080
 with godly people, you submit to,

879
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,160
 and are shepherded by godly leadership

880
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,880
 who protect you and protect me.

881
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,400
 And it's there where we serve the body of Christ.

882
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,040
 Where do you do those things

883
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,880
 if you don't have a local church?

884
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,040
 You don't.

885
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,040
 You're the javelin thrower who's like,

886
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,400
 I threw, but I threw it in my backyard.

887
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:05,360
 The final picture, I'll land with this.

888
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,120
 While I was at A&M, the track team was there,

889
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,760
 and it was like such a perfect picture,

890
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,600
 honestly, of the body of Christ in so many ways,

891
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,680
 because you'd come together, and there was like 80 of us,

892
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,480
 and you'd go to the track meet,

893
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,240
 and everyone did their different role and different part.

894
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,440
 Like everyone looked different,

895
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,000
 and everyone had these different events

896
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,840
 that they were a part of and different things that they did.

897
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,880
 They had like the six foot seven, 350 pound shot put guy

898
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,840
 who would throw the shot put,

899
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,400
 and then you had next to him

900
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,400
 this like 100 pound, five mile runner girl,

901
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,800
 and then next to him you had this six foot long jumper,

902
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,080
 and then you had all these different people

903
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
 who played all these different parts,

904
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,400
 and they worked best together

905
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,600
 when they each played their roles.

906
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,560
 In other words, if the shot put guy was like,

907
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,240
 I think I'm gonna take on the five mile today,

908
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,400
 fee, fi, fo, fum, it would be terrible, right?

909
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,920
 Where did that come from?

910
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,200
 It would be terrible.

911
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,360
 (congregation laughing)

912
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,560
 Fee, fi, fo, fum.

913
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
 Okay, it would be terrible, right?

914
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,020
 Like the team would suffer.

915
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,120
 No, he was designed and created,

916
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,840
 he does best when he's doing what he was designed

917
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,320
 and created to do, playing his role on the team.

918
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,880
 Same with the five mile runner.

919
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,000
 In the body of Christ, like we're stronger together

920
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,120
 when we all come and we say, I'm gonna play my role,

921
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,560
 I'm gonna do my part, this is what I can bring to the table,

922
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,280
 this is the role that I'm going to play.

923
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,000
 And just like in that track team,

924
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,360
 when the runner was going

925
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,920
 and the shot put guy was over there, they championed.

926
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,600
 You do what you do, you run.

927
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,160
 I can't run, but I wanna see you run, you're doing awesome.

928
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
 I'm not angry at not having the ability to run,

929
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,960
 I'm not jealous of it, I'm gonna champion you.

930
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,540
 We're stronger together because when you win, I win.

931
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,920
 We're the body of Christ, we're all gonna come together

932
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,620
 and do whatever, we don't have to be the best

933
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,040
 in the world at anything, but we can say,

934
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,640
 God, this is the best that I can have

935
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,840
 and I want you to have it, I'm gonna give it to you.

936
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,960
 This is how it was made and I wanna surrender, submit that

937
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,720
 and serve you with it.

938
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,180
 The invitation tonight, if you're not a part

939
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,300
 of a local church, this Sunday, for those of us in Dallas,

940
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,780
 for Fort Worth, Garrett's gonna talk to you

941
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,020
 about what you have coming up.

942
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,020
 This Sunday at 11.15 a.m., come and be a part

943
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,020
 of a local church, it's membership class this Sunday.

944
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,940
 If you're like, do you guys just wanna grow Watermark?

945
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,580
 Let me just say, there is no part of us that wants to grow,

946
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,700
 I guess there is a part of us that wants to grow Watermark.

947
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,260
 If there's lots of lost people out there,

948
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,820
 we're great with growing 'em and growing 'em

949
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,960
 and you can go to another church

950
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,300
 if that rubs you the wrong way.

951
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,900
 We're great with reaching lost people.

952
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,220
 But primarily, the reason why we want you to be connected

953
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,700
 is because it grows you.

954
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:42,660
 You will get a lot more than you ever give.

955
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,460
 And so if you're not a part of a local church,

956
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,120
 this is your weekend.

957
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,420
 This is your step to adulting.

958
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,300
 You know, there's high schoolers in this body

959
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,900
 who are members, that's just embarrassing, lots of 'em,

960
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,820
 who are members of this church, like they're in high school,

961
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,380
 16, which is unbelievable to be like, I'm 16,

962
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,380
 I'm gonna go through membership.

963
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,140
 And we have 28-year-olds who are gonna,

964
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,400
 I've never taken that step.

965
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,340
 I think a lot of you never even knew that it was important.

966
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,740
 But now you know.

967
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,500
 And the God who loves you is not trying to rip you off,

968
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,940
 not trying to get something from you,

969
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,100
 but give something to you, is inviting you,

970
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:23,400
 you connect to the body of Christ where you will change.

971
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,500
 Connect to the body of Christ where through it,

972
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,500
 the world is changed, has been changed, and will change.

973
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,940
 If you're not a part of that,

974
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,580
 I'm gonna pray that you would be.

975
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,360
 Let me pray.

976
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,640
 Father, I pray for my friends in the room,

977
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,760
 thank you for just the gift of your church,

978
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,300
 your bride, who you love,

979
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,300
 who you say that you bought your own blood with,

980
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,700
 who you hold in such high regard that you say

981
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,980
 the elders are the leadership of a church,

982
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,060
 a local flock, they're gonna give an account to me.

983
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,220
 And so Father, I pray for our elders,

984
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,780
 would you protect them, would you lead them,

985
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,820
 would they hear your voice,

986
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,900
 would they yield to your word and to your spirit?

987
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
 I pray for my friends in the world, in the room,

988
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,500
 who are not a part of a local church,

989
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,380
 would you convict, would you move them?

990
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,820
 Maybe it's not here, maybe it's another church.

991
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,540
 Lord, would you move them to join another church,

992
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,680
 to give their gifts to another church,

993
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,140
 but to give it to the bride of Christ at some local church?

994
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,940
 Thank you for Jesus, who loves us as his bride,

995
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,620
 despite all of our flaws, all of our imperfections,

996
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,820
 and who allows us to serve with our gifts,

997
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,920
 allows us to be protected through godly leadership,

998
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,060
 allows us to be loved, cared for,

999
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,780
 and surrounded by godly people, would that mark our lives?

1000
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,180
 Thank you, in Jesus' name, amen.
