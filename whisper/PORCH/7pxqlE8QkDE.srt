00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 [Applause]

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Porch, how are we doing?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 We doing okay tonight?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Doing alright?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 It's great to see you.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Man, I'm so glad to be back.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 There feels like no better way to start a brand new year

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 than being right back in this room with this group of people.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 So thanks for being here.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 If this is your very first time, let me be, hopefully not the first,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 but one of the first to just welcome you.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This is a really special thing that's happening,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 not because I'm standing up here or the band's up here

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 or we've got amazing leaders that are around the room,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 but because God is here.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I really believe that.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 God is, he's really given us as a team and as a ministry

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 and as a group of friends a great vision for what he wants to do this year.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And yet the heart behind this entire ministry

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 is that this wouldn't just feel like something you show up and spectate in.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 It would feel like something we're all participating in.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 That's why we wanted to represent it with a big choir on the platform.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We wanted to put people in front of you just like you.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That way you know, man, this is something we're all on the same level

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 engaging with the same God about.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So welcome. So glad that you're in the room.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You need to know this before we go any further.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 We're going to look at a different text in just a minute.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But the passage of scripture that we're established on as a ministry

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 that's straight right to the core of who we are

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 is a scripture called, a scripture that's Psalm 27, 4.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And it says this, it says,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 "There's one thing that I ask that will I seek after

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple."

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 That's what we want this place to be.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 A place where, man, every one of us is seeking to get as close to God as possible.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 God, we want to dwell in your house.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Like, yes, there's so many things in life that could demand our attention.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And yet there's one thing worthy of our attention,

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and it's to be with you. It's to get close to you.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And so, God, that's what we want. We want to come near.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 We believe there's no one like you, that you're most beautiful of all,

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 and you're worthy of knowing.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And so that's what we're going to do.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 The way that we do it is we like to read the scriptures together.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And we love that God is letting us do this with the people here in Dallas, Texas,

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 but he's also letting us do this with the people all over the nation

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 because the porch doesn't just gather in this room,

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 it gathers in rooms all over the country.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 So would y'all do a great job of helping me say hello

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 to our Porch Live locations right now?

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 That'd be awesome. Porch Live, we love you.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I just want to say a special shout out to Porch Live, Fort Worth, Indy, Midland, Wheaton,

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Springfield, Dayton, Greater Lafayette, Scottsdale, and Fresno.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 We love what God is doing where you are.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And as much expectation as we have for this room,

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 we have an equal amount where you are too.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Well, it is the beginning of a brand new year.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 How are you feeling about it?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 2025 is officially upon us. How do you feel?

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 You feel good? Yeah. Mixed reviews. I get it, man.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 And yet what we know is at the beginning of a brand new year

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 is likely the start of a journey towards some new goal

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 that you may have set out for yourself.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Sure, maybe you don't subscribe to traditional resolutions.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 You might be an ins and outs list kind of person.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And yet the reality is wherever you fall with respect to your commitment in the new year,

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 what we know is we all want to do something meaningful with ourselves in this calendar year.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 We want to achieve something or accomplish something or attain something significant.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's characteristic of us all.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Maybe it's losing 10 pounds.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Or maybe it's gaining 10 pounds and drinking as much creatine as it takes to get there.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Maybe it's landing that job that you have always dreamed of.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Or it's leaving the job that you currently dread.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 They've taken too much of my life.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It's time for me to get some of my life back.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Maybe it's finding new friends or reconnecting with old friends.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Maybe it's speaking out more.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Letting the world know, "I've got a voice."

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Maybe it's thinking before you speak and letting the world know you actually can control your voice.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Maybe it's getting more sleep at night.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Or maybe it's just trying to get out of bed every morning.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I don't know what the case may be for you.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Why don't you tell me? What are your new year's resolutions?

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You got something? Anything that's in for the new year?

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Just shout it out.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Run a marathon.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 You're going to do that one on your own, my guy.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 What else you got? Give me something else.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Wait, wait, wait. Ironman? You just got one-upped.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 This friend says he's going to go further.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 He's also going to swim and bike.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 What else? Give me something more.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I heard basketball.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 What was it? Come on, man.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Dunk a basketball. Dunk a basketball.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Okay, man, let us know when it happens.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 What else?

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 You know, if I could discern what you all want to do,

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I would call these things out, but it's a massive humanity.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And what I know, though, is you're verifying the fact

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 that we've all got something we want to do in the new year.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 We've got big dreams, big hopes, goals that we want to achieve,

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 destinations that we want to arrive at.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 That was the case for Brooke and I.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Whenever several years ago we decided to go and visit the Greek islands.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 While we were there, we spent several days on the island of Santorini.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Anybody been to Santorini before?

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Show of hands, anybody want to go to Santorini?

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 If you don't have a hand up, you should definitely put a hand up,

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 because that place is amazing.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 While we were in Santorini, there was one thing we knew we wanted to see,

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 because it was a must-see attraction.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 It was this volcanic hot spring.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Just the sound of it is awesome.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And yet, it came with one massive complication,

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 because in order to get to the volcanic hot spring,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 you had to sail through the Aegean Sea, which sounds awesome.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Even just the thought of moving through a Greek sea sounds incredible,

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 until you think about the fact that while beautiful,

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 at the time of year which we were in Greece,

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 we knew that there were these melteme winds,

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 which are really unpredictable or unreasonable gale force winds

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 that would stir up over the sea and would throw the entire thing into a commotion.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 It was a disorienting journey, to say the least.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And yet, we knew we wanted to get to this volcanic hot spring.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So how did we do it?

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Did we do it because we really wanted it,

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and we were going to find a way to get there on our own?

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 No. We needed to find someone that was skillful at decision-making,

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 that was accustomed to the open waters, a true sea dog, if you will.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 We needed to find a captain who was trained at reading the waves

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and watching the wind and adjusting course accordingly,

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 depending upon what happened in the journey.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Now, why do I tell you that?

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Because the reality is, many of us, we enter into a new year

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 with hopes of a proverbial hot spring.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 We've got something that we really want to get to,

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 and yet the difference between where we are and where we want to be

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 requires not just desire, not just discernment,

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 but true dependence on someone that knows better than ourselves.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 You see, the reality is, the hope you have today

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 and the future you want tomorrow

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 is separated by the difference of several decisions

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 that you must make along the way.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 But what you bring to the table is not your savvy decision-making.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 You bring a really intentional dependence

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 on one that knows the waters better than yourself.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 That's what I want to talk with you about tonight.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 We're sitting at the beginning of a brand new year,

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and yet there's a way to navigate the new in 2025,

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 particularly three steps that I want to help you understand.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to the book of Numbers.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Chapter 13. Numbers 13.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Just to bring you up to speed,

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 we're catching up to the people of God in a moment where

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 they're standing at the beginning of a brand new chapter themselves.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They are staring down the barrel of their own new beginning.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 They're at the precipice of God's promise,

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 the doorstep of the land they've longed for.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But to get there, to go into the promised land,

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 they have to make a really big decision.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 They have to navigate their own set of new.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And as we watch them do it, we'll learn some things for ourselves.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So this is what it says, Numbers 13, starting in verse 1.

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 The Lord spoke to Moses saying,

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which is the promised land."

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 That's the land that they're going into.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 "Which I'm going to give to the people of Israel.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man,

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 every one a chief among them."

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Now, at first glance, this feels really wise, doesn't it?

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Like send spies out, collect new intel, do some reconnaissance,

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 build a scouting report.

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Like it makes reasonable sense to do research before you make a big decision.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Yes?

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Listen, if you're in the room, you're a young man,

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 you want to ask out a young lady, you should probably do some recon.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Like you should probably figure out, man, like is she available?

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Is she interested in actually dating somebody?

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 If she were, where would she want to go?

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 What would she want to do?

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 What would be the best way to actually engage this individual?

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Should I text her?

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Nah, that's probably too impersonal.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Should I call her?

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Ah, that could be awkward.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Maybe I'll just flirt with her through her Insta story.

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Ah, that might be slightly misdirected.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Is DMing still a thing?

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Should I send one?

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Maybe I shouldn't.

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 That might be ill-advised.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Talk to her?

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 No way.

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I would never, right?

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 No, you need to do some recon.

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Like you have to do some research to figure out, man,

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 what's the best way for me to make a big move?

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So spying on the land seems like a really good idea.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 That is until you realize that it's not God's idea.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It's the people's, which can feel confusing because you read this in verse 1,

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 it says, "The Lord spoke to Moses saying, 'Send men to spy out the land of Canaan.'"

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 It sounds like God's idea.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So how is it not his?

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Well, if you go and you read Deuteronomy, what you find is Moses is actually speaking

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 to an entire new generation of Israelites, and he's recollecting this story.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He's telling them what happened in times past,

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 and this is what he says in Deuteronomy 1, verses 20-22.

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He says, "Then I said to you, 'We've reached the hill country of the Amorites,

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 which the Lord our God is giving us.'"

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 See, the Lord your God has given you the land.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 You hear the past tense?

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 "Go up and take possession of it as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, told you.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Don't be afraid. Don't be discouraged.

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Then all of you came to me and said, 'Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.'"

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 So was it God's idea or was it the people's?

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It was the people's. They cook up the idea.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So then what's happening in verse 1? God is simply permitting the pursuit of it.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That's what he's doing in verse 1. He is allowing them to do that which they want.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 You see, God isn't telling them, "Yeah, you really need to go spy out the land,"

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 because by this point, God has already spied out the land.

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Like, he's not searching anything he has not already searched.

227
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 If you go and you read, what you see is God has been promising this little piece of real estate

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 to God's people, their ancestors, for centuries.

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Like, you see, he predicts literally everything they're going to find.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 What specific nations there were, Genesis 15, how rich the land would be,

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 how he would defeat their enemies in Exodus 3, that this was their promised inheritance in Genesis 12.

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 They had no reason to search out the land because God already searched it out for them.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So why did they do it?

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Because they trusted themselves more than they trusted God.

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 They knew. There's a destination that we want to get to,

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 but I don't know that the captain knows best.

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Maybe we should grab the will and we should direct this thing ourselves.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's a massive misstep, and it's not one we should take if we want to navigate the new.

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Instead, the first step we have to take as we move into a new year

240
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 and we consider the things that we believe God is leading us towards

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 is we have to know it is better to trust God's word than man's wisdom.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 It's better to trust God's word than man's wisdom.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 They have every reason to believe God.

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 They don't get to this point, to the foot of the promised land, without him.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And yet what they realize is despite everything he's done, they conclude he hasn't done enough.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Which feels crazy when you think about everything they've lived through.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 If you go and you read the moments that lead them to this situation here,

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 two years after they've been journeying from Egypt to the foot of the promised land,

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 what you see is God part of the Red Sea for them.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 He brought manna from heaven. He brought water from a rock.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 He was leading them by his own presence through a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You hear all that and it's like, "They are crazy!"

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Why wouldn't they believe him?

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Why wouldn't they trust him?

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Why do they need to actually discern what's ahead for themselves?

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Why would they do that?

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 What's funny is we do equally crazy things.

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Often we choose to trust ourselves instead of trusting in God.

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Because you see, where God made a way for them through the waters,

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 he has made a way for you through your sin by Jesus Christ.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Where they forgot the fact that he provided manna from heaven,

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 we often forget the fact that we've been given the bread of life through Christ himself.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Where he poured water from a rock, we have living water in Jesus.

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 The presence of God, cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, that's amazing.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 We have the presence of God indwelling through his Holy Spirit.

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It's crazy that we wouldn't trust him ourselves.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And yet we do this.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Like we stand on the cusp of that which God has been leading us to.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Moving to a new city and taking a new opportunity.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 The chance to change our career all together.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Or having gospel conversations with our neighbors.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Or going to therapy to unpack our past and pursue healing.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Or reconciling with a friend that we've lost touch with because of some hurt caused in the distant past.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Whatever it may be, we often stand on the cusp of what God's leading us into.

275
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 But rather than respond in faith porch, we reason in fear.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 We reason in fear.

277
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 We do what they do.

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 We talk ourselves out of what God is talking us into.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Because we trust our discernment more than we trust his own.

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Listen to what the psalmist says in Psalm 146.

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He says, "Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man in whom there is no salvation.

282
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 When his breath departs, he returns to the earth, and on the very day his plans perish.

283
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Blessed is he whose help is in the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God."

284
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 You trust in him, you don't trust in yourself.

285
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Now, some of you hear me unpacking this point and you're like, "But Kylan, listen.

286
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Are you telling me that I shouldn't be measured and prudent and wise with respect to my choices?

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Like, I'm supposed to just trust my gut, follow my heart, follow my instincts?"

288
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 No, I'm not telling you to just do that.

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And neither is God.

290
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And yet the reality is, often, we are not at risk of being hasty.

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 We are in danger of being hesitant.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Like, we hear the call of God.

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 We know what his word says, and yet we're slow to obey it.

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 We feel conviction, but we're reluctant to take any action.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 We process and we pray and we second-guess, despite the fact that everybody in our community is looking at us and saying,

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 "Yeah, you should do it. You should go for it."

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 We're reluctant.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You see, what we do is we, instead of initiating in faith, we procrastinate in fear.

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And the reality for why that is is because we don't just want clarity of God's plans.

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 We want certainty of God's plans.

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Some of you are so locked up.

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You won't move into what God is trying to do in your life because you're just not certain it's going to happen.

303
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 In what world is faith and certainty possible?

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Those things cannot coexist, for faith requires the presence of some uncertainty,

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 because in the face of uncertainty, trust can exist.

306
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 God wants you to trust him.

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Now, he's not going to leave you out on a limb.

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 He's going to give you clarity.

309
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 He's going to bring conviction.

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 He's going to call you to take a step.

311
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And yet, too often, we procrastinate in fear rather than initiate in faith.

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Warren Weirsbe said, "Faith takes God at his word, and it needs no other evidence."

313
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 It trusts, man.

314
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 God knows best, and what he says goes.

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So if he says, "I go," then here I am.

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I'm ready, God.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And yet, here's the thing.

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 We struggle to do this.

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 We wrestle with it.

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 We know, oh, man, I really want to, but God, I don't know yet.

321
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And yet, in his kindness, he knows we want for more reason, and so he often gives it to us.

322
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 He does that right here in this passage.

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He does that for the Israelites.

324
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 If we keep reading, we'll actually jump to 17.

325
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 It says, "Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and he said to them,

326
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 'Go up into the Negev and go up into the hill country and see what the land is

327
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they're few or many,

328
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad,

329
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,

330
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not.

331
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Be of good courage.

332
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Bring some of the fruit of the land.'

333
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Now the time was the season of the first grapes."

334
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 I remember reading this, and it's striking me how strange it was

335
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 that Moses was giving such very specific instructions,

336
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 and yet Moses is giving specific instructions because he knows what they'll find.

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Like, he's not curious.

338
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I wonder if there's any fruit.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 He already knows because God has already told them.

340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And so he gives them very detailed instruction on what to look for.

341
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 He tells them in verse 18, "Hey, go and investigate the people.

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Are they strong? Are they weak? Are they few? Are there many?"

343
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 In verse 19, "Go and investigate the land."

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Like, is it a good land or is it a bad land?

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 How about their cities? What are they like?

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Are they big? Are they strong?

347
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Verse 20, he tells them to investigate the soil.

348
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Is it a rich soil or is it a poor soil?

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 How about the trees? Are there trees there?

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Do you see fruit? Bring some of the fruit with you.

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Like, Moses is oddly specific in what he wants them to search for

352
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 because he knows what they'll find.

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 God's told him, and he wants them to know.

354
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 If you find what God has already foretold,

355
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 then you will have sufficient motivation to go.

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Because as we seek to navigate the new,

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 our second step is God will give you good reason to go if he calls.

358
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 God will give you good reason to go if he calls.

359
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And so they're going to seek.

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 God's given us really good reason to take this land.

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And yet, Moses knows they have to find it to find sufficient motivation.

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So several years ago, Brooke and I, we were snow skiing

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 whenever she lost her iPhone somewhere out on the mountain.

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Naturally, she really wanted me to find it.

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Which wasn't incredibly motivating.

366
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 You want me to find your phone on the side of a ski slope?

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It's crazy. It's a needle in a haystack.

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 There's no way I'll do it.

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And so the mission was not incredibly motivating for me.

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 That is until I learned that her Find My Friends was miraculously working.

371
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Now I had good reason to go.

372
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I actually was moving in a way where I wasn't just searching, but I was seeking.

373
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I wasn't just aimless. I was directed.

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I knew where I could find it.

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And it motivated me to get out of my chair and get back on the mountain.

376
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And miraculously, we did in fact find the phone.

377
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 You see, that's what's happening here.

378
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 The spies, they want to survey the entirety of the land.

379
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But Moses, he doesn't want them to do it aimlessly

380
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 because that's not going to make any kind of difference for the people.

381
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 No, Moses gives them very clear instructions.

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 He doesn't want them to search.

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He wants them to seek several things in specific that will motivate the people when they're found.

384
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 That's why he says, "Hey, go and see if there's fruitfulness."

385
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 He's literally sending them to a place called the Valley of Eshkol,

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 which means the Valley of Grape Clusters.

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And it's during the season of the first ripe grapes.

388
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 What do you think they're going to find?

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 They're probably going to find some grapes.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And not just regular grapes, but grapes so big

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 that they actually have to be carried between two men on poles.

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Like that's the kind of reality they're walking into.

393
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 This is the ancient Near Eastern Napa, okay?

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 That's where God's taking them.

395
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It is bursting with life.

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 It is full of flourishing.

397
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And Moses knows, "Hey, this is a land that will motivate our people to go."

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 But you're also going to find some things that will motivate our people to not go alone,

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 but to go with God.

400
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 He tells them, "Hey, go look at the nations.

401
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Assess their strengths. Inspect their cities.

402
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 How strong are their fortresses?"

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 He knows, "Hey, the people are going to see this is a land that is bursting with abundance,

404
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 and yet also it is a land that is begging for dependence."

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 There are plenty, plenty of reasons to go,

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 but there are plenty of reasons to not go alone.

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 That's how you know if God's leading you someplace new.

408
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Some of you are here, and you're like, "Man, I'm torn between two decisions,

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 and I don't know which one I'm supposed to take."

410
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I'm trying to discern whether God's leading me in or He's leading me out.

411
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 How do I know? He gives you two reasons.

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He says, "Hey, look for signs of life," number one,

413
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 "and then look for causes for trust," number two.

414
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Like, it should be bursting with life, and it should be begging for dependence.

415
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 That's how you know.

416
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It should be bursting with life.

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Like, that's what Jesus says whenever He talked in John 10:10.

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 He's like, "Hey, the reason I came is I came to give life.

419
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Like, the thief came to steal, kill, and destroy,

420
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 and yet I came that you may have life."

421
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And guess what? Have it abundantly, just like this.

422
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 To the places that you consider, the things that you do,

423
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 you should really evaluate, "Is this going to let me give life

424
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 to the rest of the world, to the people I engage with,

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 and to the places that I occupy?"

426
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Because that's what the gospel does.

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 The gospel gives life.

428
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And so here's the thing.

429
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 If you're thinking about a new job, and yet there's no opportunity

430
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 within that job to bring gospel flourishing,

431
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 to lead people to life in Christ, then Jesus is not leading you there.

432
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 He doesn't want you to take it, because He is going to lead you

433
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 to a place that is exploding with fruitfulness.

434
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 That's what He wants to do.

435
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 If you're thinking about dating someone, and what you realize

436
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 is in this relationship, I'm more prone to compromise in my sin

437
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 than conformity in Christ, He's not leading you there.

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 He doesn't want you in it, because that's not what He's come to give.

439
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 If you're thinking about friends, man, your friends,

440
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 are they exclusive or inclusive?

441
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Because one is characteristic of Jesus, but the other is characteristic

442
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 of the world.

443
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Do they gossip, or do they encourage people?

444
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Because one is what Christ would do.

445
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The other, Christ would have nothing to do with.

446
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 What decision are you trying to make?

447
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Does it have signs of life?

448
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 But then also, it should have causes for trust, which is what we see

449
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 as we continue to go.

450
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Verses 25-28, it says,

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 "At the end of 40 days, they returned from spying out the land,

452
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 and they came to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation of the people

453
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 of Israel in the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh.

454
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 They brought back word to them, and to all the congregation,

455
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 and they showed them the fruit of the land.

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 They found it.

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 'Hey, man, here it is.

458
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Look at this stuff.'

459
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And they told him, 'We came to the land with which you sent us,

460
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 and it blows with milk and honey.'

461
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And this is its fruit, so big we had to carry it between two of us.

462
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But the people who dwell in the land are strong,

463
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 and the cities are fortified and very large.

464
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And besides, we saw the descendants of Anak there.

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Like God has led them to a land bursting with life

466
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 and brimming with potential and boasting with resistance."

467
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 It is boasting with resistance.

468
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Why would God do that?

469
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Because as God leads you into a new place, and you navigate the new,

470
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 you should know God will not lead you someplace faith is not required.

471
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 God will not lead you someplace faith is not required.

472
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 The path of greatest--or the path of least resistance

473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 is never the path of greatest faith.

474
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 The path of least resistance is never the path of greatest faith.

475
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And the reason for that is because the path of least resistance needs no God.

476
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 We don't live lives where we do not need Him.

477
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Such an existence is not possible.

478
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 If we follow God, then we can expect we will go places beyond compare,

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and we will go places far beyond our depth.

480
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Why? Because He wants you to trust Him.

481
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 He wants you to need Him.

482
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 He wants you to cling to Him, not just in the face of adversity.

483
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Yes, He wants that.

484
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 But He wants you to cling to Him, grip Him,

485
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 hold fast to Him in the moments of opportunity as well.

486
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Like these people, they knew, "God, we really need you in the wilderness.

487
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 We've got some big problems out here."

488
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And yet, God, the minute we've gotten to the promised land,

489
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I think we're good. I think we don't need you any longer.

490
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 We can make decisions for ourselves.

491
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 We can figure out the way on our own.

492
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 God's having none of it.

493
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Like, God is not just a God that we need in the face of our troubles

494
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and our trials and our testing.

495
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 No, God is a God we need at all times and in all ways.

496
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Like, I think God is looking at them in this moment.

497
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 He's like, "Hey, that is not how this relationship works.

498
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Like, I will be there with you to work through your problems,

499
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 but I will also be there to walk with you into my promises.

500
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 You will never not need me.

501
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You will never not need me."

502
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And that's actually good news,

503
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 because I will never not be there.

504
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 So many of us, we wrestle with inadequacy,

505
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 but have you ever thought your inadequacy, "I'm not enough,"

506
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 is actually, it's just a declaration of dependency, but my God is.

507
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Sure, I'm not enough to be eloquent in my workplace

508
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 and lead my coworkers to Christ,

509
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 but my God is enough, and I depend on him,

510
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and so I know I can do it.

511
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I'm not bold enough to approach my neighbor

512
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 and really help them in the face of their situation

513
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 and share Christ's love with them,

514
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 but even though I'm not bold enough,

515
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Jesus in me is bold enough.

516
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I can move in my dependency.

517
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I'm not strong enough to forgive that person.

518
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Good thing Christ is with me.

519
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He is strong enough to forgive every person.

520
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 That is the heart he has, not just to love his friends,

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 but to love his enemies.

522
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Any inadequacy you feel, it is a declaration of dependency.

523
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Jesus, I never don't need you,

524
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 and you are always here with me, God.

525
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Praise the Lord that that is the case.

526
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Friends, God will never take you someplace where he becomes optional.

527
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He will always take you places where he is required,

528
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 because those are the only places that actually exist.

529
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 He will take us where we are most dependent,

530
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 for when we're in greatest need, he is closest by.

531
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Like, God did this to me yesterday.

532
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Yesterday.

533
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Like, I was going a completely different direction with this talk.

534
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 I had been planning it for weeks.

535
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I had been doing deep study

536
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and building great illustrations

537
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 and assembling carefully worded points

538
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 and gathering parallel scriptures,

539
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 all pointing to the person of Jesus.

540
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 I had been prepping this message that I felt God gave me

541
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 shortly after the porch ended in 2024.

542
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 And yet last night, in the wee hours of the morning,

543
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 it's like I hit a block.

544
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And I was talking to the Lord, and I was like,

545
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 "God, I've been writing, but I can't write any longer.

546
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 What is happening, God?"

547
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Like, we've been sitting on this.

548
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Like, this is something we've been preparing for, Lord.

549
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Why is it so frustrated now?

550
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Why are you complicating my life?

551
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Why are you contesting my purposes, Lord?

552
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And I think he was looking at me, and he's like,

553
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 "Hey, I have something else I want you to do.

554
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I want you to walk with me and depend on me along the way.

555
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 I want us to do something different,

556
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 and I want you to be willing to move by faith."

557
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And so we started thinking about this passage.

558
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And it feels so consistent with what God would do in my life,

559
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 so consistent with what God will do in your life,

560
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 because he will not lead us places

561
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 where faith is not required.

562
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I remember when I moved from Houston,

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and I came to Dallas, I was driving here,

564
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 car loaded with all of my belongings to finally settle.

565
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And I told the Lord, "God,

566
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 if your presence will not go with me,

567
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 do not take me up from here.

568
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And we made that agreement, birthed right out of Exodus 33.

569
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And as I've arrived, what I know is,

570
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 even in moments where faith feels required,

571
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I know that agreement still stands,

572
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 for God is always with me.

573
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 His presence will not depart.

574
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Now, why do I tell you that?

575
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Firstly, because whenever I do preach that other sermon,

576
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 it's gonna be great.

577
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And I can't wait for the day when it happens,

578
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 so you should stick around.

579
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 But secondly, and primarily the reason I share that with you,

580
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 is because God, in his kindness, will lead you places

581
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 where your faith will be asked much of,

582
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 but his presence will always deliver on.

583
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Do you want that?

584
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Do you want that?

585
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Like to live not just a year, but to live a life

586
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 where you experience the unexplainable,

587
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 where you make way through the world

588
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 into things that happen.

589
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 People can't really measure up who you are with what that is.

590
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 There's a discrepancy.

591
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You're not great enough, you're not smart enough,

592
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 you're not impressive enough, you're not talented enough.

593
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Why then are these things happening?

594
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Why is it that someone so simple as you

595
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 could find yourself dwelling in the face

596
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 of something as amazing as this?

597
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 How is it that you arrived to a place of promise?

598
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And you'll be able to look at them and say,

599
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 it's nothing that I've done,

600
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 but it's by everything that my Christ has done.

601
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 That's what they have the opportunity to do,

602
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 to move into a place that is so significant,

603
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 and yet they're shackled in fear.

604
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 And yet as we read, we find one man who defies the rest.

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Like he looks forward and he's not shackled in his fear.

606
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Instead, he is released by his faith.

607
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It says in Numbers 13 30, but Caleb, he quieted the people.

608
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Everyone's freaking out.

609
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And he's like, calm down.

610
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Everybody's silent.

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Let us go up at once and occupy it.

612
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 For we are well able to overcome it.

613
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Caleb knows this is impossible apart from God.

614
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 So thank goodness our God is with us.

615
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 No foe is too great.

616
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 No fear is too strong.

617
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 No force is too mighty.

618
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 If God goes with us, how do we know that?

619
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 We can be confident that God will go with us in times ahead.

620
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Because God came towards us in times past.

621
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 We can look back and we can see the fact

622
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 that Christ has stepped into our reality

623
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 and he has made all the difference.

624
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Like Jesus, he trusted the words of God

625
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 more than the wisdom of man.

626
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Like he knew there's a call on my life

627
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 and he did not hesitate from fulfilling it.

628
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 He was obedient.

629
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 He wasn't reluctant.

630
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 He was released.

631
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 He made moves because he knew if God's saying it,

632
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 then I'm going for it.

633
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And we also know that Jesus,

634
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 he knew God had given him a good reason to go.

635
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Like he looked at you and he looked at me

636
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 and he was like, man, they are enslaved in darkness.

637
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 They can do nothing for themselves.

638
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I need to get there.

639
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 They need my help.

640
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 I will go quickly and I will come to them

641
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 that they might be with you again, God.

642
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And then Jesus, while going to Calvary,

643
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 walked to a place where faith was most required of all

644
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 as he laid down his life for the sins of many.

645
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Friends,

646
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 it's better to follow Jesus into a dangerous future

647
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 than abandon Jesus for a safe existence.

648
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 For Jesus abandoned a safe existence.

649
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 (soft music)

650
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 So that you might not have a dangerous future.

651
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 What is shackling you in fear tonight?

652
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 What is keeping you dependent upon yourself

653
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 as opposed to God?

654
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 He wants to identify it.

655
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And then he wants you to let it go.

656
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Not just because it's a new year,

657
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 but because you have a new life in Christ Jesus.

658
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 God, we love you.

659
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And we thank you that we had time now, God,

660
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 just to work through your scripture.

661
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 We're eager to sing back to you, God.

662
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,500
 (soft music)

663
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:02,000
 God, we want to be a people

664
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 that live our lives where faith is most required.

665
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,500
 (soft music)

666
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 We want to be a people that go God wherever it is you want.

667
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
 We know God so often,

668
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,500
 it's our fear that locks us up,

669
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 that keeps us at bay,

670
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 that will not let us move forward.

671
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
 And so God, what we're asking

672
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
 is that you would release us from that fear.

673
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
 That you would set us free from a safe existence

674
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,500
 and lead us into a glorious inheritance.

675
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
 The chance, God, to be with you,

676
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
 to live as Christ,

677
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 and to experience all God that you want to give.

678
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 This isn't a prosperity gospel.

679
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 No, God, this is your promise to us

680
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,500
 that every day forward with you

681
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 is better than any day we've lived behind.

682
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
 And yet, God, we know that days forward

683
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,500
 are days where we must walk by faith and not by fear.

684
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,500
 And so God, we pray that you would help us to do it.

685
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,500
 I pray, God, that you would help us right now

686
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,500
 as we take action on it, please.
