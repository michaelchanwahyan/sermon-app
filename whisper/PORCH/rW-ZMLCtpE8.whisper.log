[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.160]   How are we doing?
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.680]   It's great to be back with you.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.120]   What's up Fort Worth?
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.460]   Shout out Houston.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.680]   Everybody driving down the road, listening to the message, live streaming at home.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.040]   We're glad you're tuned in.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:42.440]   The preface of tonight is that we find identity throughout our lives in different things.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.520]   And so in college, I was identified as a partier.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.520]   Okay.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.520]   I didn't know Christ.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520]   I didn't walk with Jesus.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.340]   I loved to party, love to go out.
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.120]   And so there was a part of that is it's who I was, or at least who I thought I was.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.560]   And so I went to school at this small college in Waco.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.520]   And if we really wanted to party in Waco, we would come to Dallas.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.040]   And so my boys and I, we drove up to Dallas and we were going to go to this club in Deep
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040]   Ellum.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.520]   And the problem was, is they were all over 21 and I was not.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   Okay.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.400]   But that's okay because we had a plan.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.480]   So what was going to happen is my roommate was going to get in and then pass back his
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480]   ID.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480]   Okay.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.960]   Don't try this at home.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.380]   I know you wouldn't, again, not walking with Jesus, not a Christian at this time.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.040]   And so we're waiting in this line, in this club here in Dallas and Deep Ellum.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.800]   And he gets through and I'm watching the bouncer.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   Like he's not even looking at IDs.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.820]   I'm like, this is going to be easy.
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.400]   And I'm kind of banking on the fact that he's not going to look at the ID.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.280]   And so he gets in, works like a charm.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.720]   There's six people between us.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.680]   We did that strategically, pass back the ID.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.400]   I get up there, I hand it to him and he starts looking at it real close.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.920]   And he says, this isn't you.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.440]   And I'm just kind of like, I'm trying to intimidate him a little bit.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.780]   And he says, "Babak Ali Hadid."
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:39.880]   To which I say, "It is me."
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.480]   Like I'm thinking, I'm playing the race card a little bit.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.880]   I'm like, no, don't, you can't hold me down, bro.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   Don't, you know?
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.640]   I'm like, I'm going to get in this.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.600]   And then I had accounted for that.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.040]   I had had that conversation in my head, but then he said something I didn't think about
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   very well.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   He says, "It says you're five nine."
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.560]   So just in case we don't know each other, like this is five nine.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.440]   So I'm thinking fast.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.160]   I said, it's a typo.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.320]   I'm five 19.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   I didn't say that.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.280]   I didn't really say that.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.080]   Long story short, I didn't get in there.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.760]   And if you think about what I was trying to do is I was trying to use a fake ID to get
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760]   in.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.420]   But what I think is a greater tragedy is most of us, right?
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.700]   We will go through lives embracing fake IDs.
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.120]   We will think we are someone who we're not.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.120]   That's what I was trying to do.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.320]   I was pretending to be someone who I wasn't.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.720]   And right now, some of you came in this evening and you are finding identity in someone or
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.000]   some things that you're not.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   And I hope this evening, as we wrap up this series called Amnesia, about forgetting who
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.760]   you are, forgetting your identity, I hope we have a greater understanding of who God
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.040]   truly made us to be and what really matters and who we really are.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:34.080]   Because if you go through this life and you begin to find identity in the wrong things,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.520]   you get to the end of this life and you realize that you embraced all the things that don't
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.040]   matter.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:51.160]   And there's this wake up call that you potentially wasted every second the Lord entrusted to
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.880]   you, believing that you are someone who you aren't.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:06.960]   And so let me explain with a thoughtful question for you, maybe the most important question.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.920]   Some would say the most important question.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.520]   Who are you?
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.720]   How do you answer that?
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   Who are you?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   What goes through your mind?
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.880]   You know, first you say a name.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.360]   Well, the name's not who you are.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   It's a sound.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.760]   It's something your parents came up with so that you would know you were talking to them.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.040]   It's certainly not who you are.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.200]   You say, well, my hometown is where I'm from.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   Well, that's where you're from.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.400]   It's not who you are.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   That's a geographic location.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.960]   Okay, well, my family name.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.360]   Okay, you're telling me about other people now who are related to you, still not who
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   you are.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   Okay, my job.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.920]   Well, that's interesting trivia question, but that's not who you are.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.160]   My hobby is still not who you are.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   Good to know.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   Who are you?
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.320]   And maybe right now you're like, oh, JP, I know that I'm a child of God.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.160]   Don't Jesus juke me.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.080]   That's not what you go through life thinking, hey, this is who I really am.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:06.960]   All the decisions that we make in life, we're essentially accessorizing a character based
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.360]   on who we think they are.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.240]   The car we drive, the bag we carry, the clothes we wear, where we work, where we live, our
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   apartment, whatever, our neighborhood, our friends.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.920]   We're accessorizing a character of who we think we are, but it's not who you are.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.720]   The apostle Paul is going to tell us this evening who you are and to do so he's going
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.400]   to look at fake identities, fake IDs for your consideration.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.720]   We're going to be in Philippians chapter three.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.400]   So if you turn to the New Testament there towards the second half of the Bible and you
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.160]   move through the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and then you move through Acts and Romans,
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.040]   Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, chapter three is where we'll be.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   Really the whole chapter.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.360]   I'm going to fly by not teaching so much verse by verse, more thematically through this chapter
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:04.000]   as we look at fake IDs that the apostle Paul identifies who we are.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And really kind of the points up front is the reality that you're not your accomplishments,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.160]   you're not your mistakes, and you're not your desires.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.000]   You're so much more than those things.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.680]   To set this up, Philippi is a part of the Roman Empire, an important part of the Roman
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.920]   Empire because there was a civil war that took place there, a battle that took place
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.760]   in this city in 42 BC.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.040]   And because of that battle, what happened as a result of the battle is the Roman Emperor
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.280]   granted the Philippians the opportunity to be Roman citizens.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.840]   Now you think, what's the big part about that?
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.120]   Well, as you think about the Roman Empire, the 70 million people that encompassed the
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.120]   Roman Empire, only 9% of them were Roman citizens.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.960]   And so this town, the people of this town, the Philippians, they found identity in their
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.640]   citizenship of Rome.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.200]   Not just that, but then you take this religious group, the Way, known as Christians, Christ
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.880]   followers, and there's these Judaizers coming in.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.040]   What that means is there's these people, this religious group that is saying, "Hey, you
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.920]   need to be identified by the good works that you do.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.080]   Not just the good works, but the way you treat your body, the way you dress, and things that
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.960]   you do to yourself.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.920]   That's really how you get good with God."
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.180]   That is also a fake ID.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:28.660]   So citizenship and what you do, these are two fake IDs that Paul is addressing as he
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.180]   writes this chapter 3, verse 4.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:39.460]   If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.460]   Almost sounds arrogant.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.780]   But then he goes through his resume.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.260]   He says, "Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:53.060]   a Hebrew of Hebrews, in regard to the law of Pharisee, as for zeal, persecuting the
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060]   church, as for righteousness based on the law, faultless."
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.180]   Let me put that in modern language for you because we read that and we're like, "What
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.180]   does that mean?"
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.900]   He's saying, "Hey, you want to talk about my family?
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.300]   I was born to the right parents.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.940]   They got connections everywhere.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.540]   You want to talk about my education?
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.060]   Ivy League with honors.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.380]   You want to talk about power?
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.620]   I have authority over my enemies.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.100]   I can persecute them.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.500]   You want to talk about religion?
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.940]   I never missed a day of church.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.700]   I've memorized more Bible than you've forgotten.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.020]   You want to talk about respect?
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.180]   Other guys, older guys, call me for advice.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.700]   You want to talk about money, stuff, status?
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.460]   I win.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.380]   What do you want to measure success on?
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.420]   I'm better than you."
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.460]   That's what he's saying.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:46.020]   But then he says this, "But whatever were gains to me, I now consider loss for the sake
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.020]   of Christ.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:56.820]   What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.340]   Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.460]   I consider them garbage."
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.980]   In the Greek scruple of the word there, it's almost a curse word like crap.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.100]   He's saying, "I consider it trash."
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.100]   It's slang.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:25.700]   "I consider it excrement in comparison to knowing Christ."
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.700]   The first fake ID that we're looking at is your accomplishments.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.980]   The apostle Paul is not identified by his accomplishments or his resume.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.700]   He's saying, "Hey, I know that I'm better than you by any measuring tool that you can
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.540]   come up with, but I no longer point to what I've accomplished.
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.700]   I point to what Christ accomplished for me."
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.540]   He makes this really big effort to explain this so that you would find identity not in
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.900]   what he's done, but in what was done on his behalf.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.260]   This is so important.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:06.660]   I think it's the hardest lesson for us to learn outside of the incomprehensible grace
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.900]   that God gives us.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.780]   He's saying, "Let me lay out some fake IDs for you guys.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.620]   What you make, it's not who you are.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.580]   Where you work, it's not who you are.
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.180]   Who you date, that's not who you are.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.500]   Who your family is.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:36.100]   Do you find pride or bow up or say, 'Hey, this is my ...' Your ethnicity, that's not
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.940]   who you are.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.660]   How many followers you have.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.100]   Are these things that you think about more than you think about your identity in Jesus?
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.340]   That's not who you are.
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.860]   Where you live, the neighborhood, what apartment you live in, where you bought a house, the
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.060]   fact that you were able to buy a house, this is not who you are," he's saying.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.060]   He's telling us this.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.620]   "This is not what is ultimately important.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.860]   It's not bad things.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.860]   It's just not who you are."
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:10.340]   He says, "All the things that you think are worth working for, they're crap to me."
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.900]   I use that word because he did.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.620]   They won't matter in 100 years.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:25.720]   He says ... Actually, let me explain it like this.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.660]   It's very philosophical and difficult, and I don't want you to get stuck early in the
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.940]   message thinking about this in a loop, but I will say this up front.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.140]   I think the most honest answer to who you are is who you will be permanently.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.420]   If you think about that, because nobody came in here saying, "Hey, this is who I am," pointing
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.860]   to who you were, pointing to old accomplishments.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.680]   We just don't do that.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.020]   We feel sorry for people who do that.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:56.380]   Some of you were the prom queen, but none of you came in wearing a tiara, saying, "That's
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.320]   right, guys.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.740]   That's who I am."
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:05.160]   You wouldn't do that, even though one day in the past it was really, really important
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   to you.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.660]   Probably, and I'm so sorry if you did, nobody came in wearing a letter jacket.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.340]   It's cold outside, so I'm going to bundle up in this guy, and plus, the patches attract
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.460]   the ladies.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.060]   Nobody did that.
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:25.380]   But once upon a time, you would have been like, "Yeah, this is who I am.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.380]   See that?
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.380]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.380]   That's what I'm talking about."
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.380]   Power lifting.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.380]   What?
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.660]   That's what you would have done.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.820]   Right now, Paul's saying, "Hey, we don't find identity in our past accomplishments."
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.860]   He's saying, "Indeed, you don't even need to find identity in your present accomplishments.
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.180]   Consider where you will be.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.420]   Consider what is going to be forever and ever and ever."
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.740]   Like at the sum of your life, at the end of it, people aren't going to talk about things
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.900]   that you did when you were little or things they didn't see or once upon a time what happened.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.420]   They're going to talk about the sum of your life.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.980]   They're going to talk about what they knew of you for the longest part of your life and
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.020]   the last part of your life.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.980]   But he's saying, "Hey, there's something past this life."
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.980]   He's going to begin to tell us this.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.140]   This is the context of this, right?
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:20.580]   We're not living in the past.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:26.380]   And so I want you to consider what accomplishment is most important to you right now.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:31.500]   And can you have the maturity to say right now, "Outside of knowing Jesus, it really
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.780]   doesn't matter.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:35.780]   I have that perspective.
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.980]   It really doesn't matter."
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.380]   He says, "I consider them garbage that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.700]   a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.300]   Christ, the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith."
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.500]   So now he's saying, "Hey, it's not my righteousness.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.300]   It's Christ's righteousness, and I want to know Christ."
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:03.620]   "Yes," he says, "to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings,
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.420]   becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining the resurrection from the dead."
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.900]   Paul is saying something really key that is true for you too.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.980]   He's saying, "The greatest thing about me is not something I've done, but something someone
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.700]   I know did."
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.660]   He says, "Let me point to one really amazing accomplishment."
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.300]   Like, what is the most amazing thing that anybody could accomplish?
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.220]   Like this thing that if you could do, we would just be like, "Well, you win.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.020]   It's better than any promotion, any trophy, any jacket, any crown."
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.740]   Like if you can do that, that's the greatest accomplishment bar none.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.460]   Let's go with A, living forever.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.180]   Eternal life.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.060]   Like you're dead, you come back to life, and you live forever.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.060]   He says, "Hey, you stack my accomplishments next to that.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.100]   I got nothing.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:01.780]   Why am I going to point to what I've done when I can point to what he's done?"
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.900]   My first point this evening is this.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:12.540]   You are identified by Christ's accomplishment, not your accomplishments.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.700]   Paul's not going to stack his accomplishments next to Christ's.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.580]   He's going to say, "Hey, I haven't missed Sunday school at all," when he has over here
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.580]   perfection.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.940]   You are identified by Christ's accomplishment, not your accomplishments.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.580]   There's something else key that's happening in this text.
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.420]   This is why he doesn't find identity in the wrongs he's done.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.620]   Because remember, this guy's done some wrongs.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.340]   He's done some terrible things, worse things than you've done, he's done.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.180]   That's why he writes in verse 12, "Not that I have already attained all this, or have
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.980]   already arrived at my goal."
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.180]   No, the goal's still ahead of me.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:46.620]   "But I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:52.140]   Brothers and sisters, porch goers, young adults, I do not consider myself yet to have taken
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.140]   hold of it.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:59.100]   But one thing I do, forgetting," listen, "forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.100]   ahead.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:04.900]   I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.900]   Christ Jesus."
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.340]   He says, "I'm not looking back, I'm looking forward.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.100]   It's not where I've been, but where I'm going that's important."
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.740]   And so the fake identity that he addresses here is being identified by your past.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.260]   Things that have happened to you, things that you participated in, sins that mark you.
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.500]   He says, "Hey, this is not who I am."
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.980]   Some of you cannot see Christ's forgiveness past your wrongdoings.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.300]   When you look at the cross, all you do is see the wrong you've done.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.940]   You don't see God's grace and his forgiveness.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.260]   The grace that he freely extends you in spite of you.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.380]   And Paul is not identified by his past.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.420]   He's not sitting here in this letter like, "Guys, I just got to tell you, remember when
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.220]   Stephen died and they stoned him and I was there and I took joy in that and then I locked
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.420]   up women and children and it says that I persecuted them in the scriptures.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.980]   It said I persecuted them to death.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.980]   I killed them.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.980]   I'm a murderer.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.980]   Woe is me.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.220]   I can't do ministry.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.220]   I'm disqualified."
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.700]   He doesn't do that.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.740]   And he doesn't even talk about abuse that he's endured.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:09.420]   He doesn't say, "Man, when I went to Antioch, they beat me.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.740]   These people turned on me.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.580]   Guys I thought were my friends stoned me.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.660]   They whipped me.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.740]   You don't know what it was like.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:17.740]   They whipped me.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.740]   I can't do ministry."
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.740]   No, he doesn't do that.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.780]   He said, "Yeah, man, terrible things happened to me.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.860]   I did terrible things.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.020]   I'm looking forward.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.380]   I'm looking ahead to the prize.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.780]   I'm looking where I'm going, not where I've been.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:38.420]   I'm looking forward."
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:45.340]   When people tell me, this conversation I have all the time, "You going to heaven?"
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.340]   "Yeah, I don't know."
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.340]   "Why?"
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:48.500]   "I've just done some things."
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.180]   They think that's humble.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.180]   It's not humble.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.380]   It's really arrogant.
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.340]   If you think that something you've done wrong can keep you from heaven, then you think that
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:04.300]   there's a good you can do to get you in heaven.
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.780]   You're only going to get to heaven because of what Christ did for you.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:14.740]   It has nothing to do with what you've done, only what you believed about Jesus.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.420]   There is no sin, no sin, none whatsoever.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.540]   The scripture says God delights in forgiving your sin.
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:28.840]   There's no sin that can disqualify you from heaven other than you rejecting Christ with
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:34.180]   your life.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:41.580]   You're not good enough to get to heaven, and you're not bad enough for heaven to be kept
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.980]   from you.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.940]   It's not about your good or bad works.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.420]   Christ's radical forgiveness doesn't belittle your sin.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.860]   It magnifies his grace.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.540]   You hear that?
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.900]   His radical forgiveness doesn't make less of your sin.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.460]   It just magnifies his amazing grace.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.780]   When I was in college, clearly I liked to drink.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.380]   I've already told you I liked to party.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.580]   I was at this particular party.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.440]   It was on Baylor's campus.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.300]   The police came, and I got arrested for MIP.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.660]   It stands for minor in possession.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.740]   I was cuffed and taken to the back of a car to jail.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.460]   I spent the night in jail.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.300]   As hard as I thought I was, I was honestly scared.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.500]   I stood before the judge the next day.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.380]   There were all these consequences, fines, and things they were putting in front of me,
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.300]   but there was this one, these words that I didn't even know why to be afraid of these
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.500]   words, but they just seemed so terrifying.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.580]   It's going to be on your record.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.020]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:59.420]   I don't even know where this record is kept and what it sounds like, but I don't want
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.820]   it to be on my record.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.900]   It just feels like for the rest of my life I'm going to meet with someone, "Hey, I'm
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.300]   JP, and I've got to tell you I've got a minor in possession in college."
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.700]   Every job interview I go to is like, "Hey, how are you?
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.420]   No, I think I'm really competent and proficient in Microsoft Word, and yes, minor in possession."
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.860]   That's just going to follow me.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.700]   I remember having a conversation with my parents, and everybody being like, "Hey, we've got
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.420]   to make sure this doesn't stay on your record."
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.980]   Not that we had a lot of money, but I remember my dad talking to an attorney and just thinking
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:36.460]   through, "Hey, what can we do to make sure this doesn't stay on my record?"
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:42.620]   I remember even bargaining with the judge and me losing my license in exchange so that
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.940]   this doesn't stay on my record.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.220]   I remember celebrating the reality that it's not on my record.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.220]   It's not on my record.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.460]   It got off my record.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.540]   It wasn't that I didn't get an MIP.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.020]   It's just that now the MIP doesn't mark me.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:55.860]   It's not like it never, ever happened.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.340]   Now it just doesn't follow me.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.500]   Is that not the beauty of the gospel, that Jesus comes to you and says, "Hey, it's not
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.180]   on your record"?
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.340]   Abortion?
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.340]   Not on your record.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.340]   Pornography?
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.340]   Not on your record.
[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.340]   Drunk driving?
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.340]   Not on your record.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.340]   DWI?
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.280]   Not on your record.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.660]   How beautiful is this that he comes to you?
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.380]   It's not like you say, "I never drove drunk."
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.380]   It's not denial.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.740]   It's like, "Hey, I did, and he forgave me.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.060]   It ain't who I am.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.980]   It's not on my record, man.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.980]   It's not on my record.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.420]   It's not who I am."
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420]   That's what Jesus does.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.660]   He comes, and he says, "Hey, man, that's not on your record."
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.060]   Why?
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.060]   Why is it not who you are?
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.060]   Because it's not who you are in eternity.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.060]   God, you don't get up there and go, "Hey, man, listen.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.060]   Come here.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.060]   Let's talk about this MIP.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   No, let's talk it before we let you in.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060]   That's cool.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.580]   Christ, cross, all that.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.580]   Preaching.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.580]   Okay, cool.
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.980]   Minor in possession."
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:57.580]   It's funny, because it ain't going to happen, because I've been forgiven.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.820]   It's not on my record.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.820]   You're identified by Christ's payment, not your past.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:12.420]   My second point, you're identified by Christ's payment, not your past.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.700]   It's not that the MIP wasn't a big deal.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:24.140]   It's that the fact that it wasn't on my record was a bigger deal.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.500]   You're identified by Christ's payment, not your past.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.460]   Paul's talking about looking toward the prize, and he says this, verse 15, "All of us then
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.540]   who are mature should take such a view of things."
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   What does he mean here?
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.540]   He's talking about maturity.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   Could you imagine talking to a high school student?
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.540]   He's like, "Hey, did you make the team?"
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.580]   He's like, "No, it doesn't matter, though.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.300]   It's not going to matter 10 years from now."
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.100]   "Hey, did you get the letter jacket?"
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.780]   "Nah, I didn't.
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:49.780]   It's okay.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.780]   It's not going to matter 10 years from now."
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.220]   You would say, "Wow, that's a really mature view."
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.540]   We are that student right now.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:00.380]   That's happening right now.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.500]   There's things right now that you're like, "They're so important."
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.900]   He's like, "No, no, they're not important.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:11.580]   A hundred years from now, they won't be important, so they're not important."
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:18.060]   If on some point you think differently, verse 15, that too God will make clear to you.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.100]   Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:26.780]   We're not focused on the punishment from the past because Christ has forgiven that, and
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.860]   God who stands outside of time sees the finished product in us, the product that he finishes
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.020]   himself, our glorified state, our sinless state presented to him white as snow, pure
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.440]   as Jesus.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.700]   He sees that standing outside of time, and so why don't we live up to what he has already
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.780]   freely given us?
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:51.020]   If I'm running a race and I've already given the prize, they say, "Hey, here's the prize.
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.460]   You win, but I just need you to run the race."
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.780]   I'm running the race, and I fall.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.820]   I don't stay down.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.940]   I get up, and I finish the race.
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.940]   I keep running.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.940]   Why?
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.020]   Because I'm a runner, not a faller.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:09.120]   In Christianity, as we walk this walk, we don't stumble, trip, fall, look at something
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.520]   I shouldn't have, did something I shouldn't have, and then just stay down.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.920]   No, man, I did it.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.300]   Dust myself off, get up, and I'm running because I'm a runner.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.920]   That's what I do in a race, and the prize is already promised to me, so why am I going
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   to stay down defeated?
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.420]   Keep going.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.600]   Live up to the prize you've already won, verse 17.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.960]   Standing together and following my example, he says, "Brothers and sisters, and just as
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:42.160]   you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.180]   For as I have often told you before and now tell you again, even with tears in my eyes,"
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.180]   think about what's happening right here.
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:55.800]   He's writing this letter in Rome, and he's writing to these people that he loves in Philippi.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.400]   As he thinks about where he's about to go, he just starts weeping, so much so that he
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.200]   tells them, "I'm weeping.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.520]   Even with tears in my eyes," you've got to hear this, guys.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.960]   "Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.400]   Their destiny is destruction."
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.320]   Simply means they're going to hell.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.040]   Their God is their stomach.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.500]   Here's what that means.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.560]   It means they worship by feeding their appetite.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.720]   They do whatever they want to do.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.080]   Have you ever met someone who does whatever they want to do?
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.560]   They're dysfunctional.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.560]   It's not good.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.200]   That is the freedom that many of us came into the room wanting.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.680]   We want to do whatever we want to do.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.880]   We want that level of freedom, yet we know consciously it makes people dysfunctional.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:56.400]   No one has ever done well with that.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.720]   Their God is their stomach.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.040]   They follow their appetite.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.600]   They feed their desires.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.440]   They feed their preferences.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.220]   Their glory is in their shame.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.160]   They take pride in the locker room, conversate.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.720]   "Man, you won't guess what I did, guess who I did, guess what happened, guess what I want.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.160]   Oh, did you see that?"
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.920]   Their glory is in their shame.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.000]   They're not just sinning.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.720]   They're proud of their sin.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:33.320]   And then it says this, consider where this is to, their mind is set on earthly things.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:40.280]   So in this list of these people whose destiny is destruction, he punctuates it with their
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.800]   mind is set on this world.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.240]   They want to be a really big deal in this world.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.960]   They're not thinking about the next world.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.800]   And so this fake ID is your earthly desires.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.400]   You being identified by your desire, "Man, I love food.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.400]   I love food.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.760]   I love shopping.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.840]   I'm a leg guy."
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.320]   You being identified by your desires.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:17.460]   I kind of picture myself as a gossip girl or a Gilmore girl or a sex in the city girl.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:24.480]   And we begin to think that our, not me, but maybe one of you, we think our desires define
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   us.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.040]   And Paul is urging you not to be identified by your earthly desires.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.720]   So we got to hear this.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:41.680]   Some of you, some folks you know, and even folks in the church, your glory is in your
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   shame.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.280]   You call what is evil good and what is good evil.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:54.460]   You made this exchange and you don't even realize that your conscience is so seared
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:01.520]   and you begin to find identity in your sexual identity or your number of partners or how
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:06.760]   much weed you smoked or how big of bar tab you've had or how drunk you've been.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.140]   "Man, remember that time we got so wasted that I threw up."
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.660]   A fight you got in.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   How you profited on someone's misfortune.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   "Boy, you wouldn't believe how I got the money.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.660]   It was great.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.660]   He was so stupid."
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.060]   And your glory is in your shame.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.260]   And you don't even see, you are celebrating the things Christ died for.
[00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.060]   The very things that held him to the cross.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.540]   You're entertained by them.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.540]   You're watching.
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.540]   I can't wait to see that movie so that I can be entertained by the things that killed my
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.420]   God on a cross.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.020]   You're out there, you're dancing to a song.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.500]   You don't even realize it's about sex trafficking, pimps and hoes and whatever.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.300]   And you're dancing to the beat, it's so great.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.660]   Glory is in your shame.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:30:03.020]   You're so lost in the world that your eternal citizenship has been lost in your life and
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.540]   you don't even see it.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.580]   You don't even know it.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:25.300]   You are entertained by the things Christ died for.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:31.420]   And there's no place for you in eternity.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:36.340]   Unless you repent.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.140]   And you turn to Christ.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.380]   You say, "Take my life.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:45.820]   I'm tired of my glory being in my shame, my destiny being in my destruction.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:51.020]   I'm tired of feeding my preferences and seeking to do whatever I want to do when I want to
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.020]   do it.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.900]   I want to learn the discipline of yielding to your Holy Spirit.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.380]   Would you give me your spirit, God?
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:03.540]   And instruct my heart, God, so that at 2am in the morning when I can't sleep, I don't
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:10.820]   return to the only coping mechanism that I've ever known, I stand strong, God.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.140]   I don't just feed my appetite.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.100]   I don't just call him because I miss him when I know he's not good for me.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.940]   I don't just go back like a dog to his vomit to the same bar scene, the same club scene,
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.520]   the same dead relationship, the same sin struggles that I've had that I thought would always
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.700]   mark me.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.700]   I'm done.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:30.700]   I'm done.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.700]   I'm done.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.180]   I turn to you, Jesus, and I believe you're enough.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.020]   I believe your death and resurrection is enough.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.540]   I'm not so arrogant to think that my sins will hold me back from you.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:50.140]   I'm not so arrogant to think that your spirit is not strong enough to heal me from this.
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.420]   I'm not so arrogant to think that I can't tell anybody about my struggles.
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.020]   I'm going to step into the light and I'm going to turn to you, Lord, and I want you to take
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.020]   over my life.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.220]   I know you are playing games tonight.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.380]   I don't want you to go into this Christmas season playing games.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.060]   I want you to stop right now.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.100]   I want you to turn to him and I want you to say, "Christ, I know you died for my sins
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.540]   and I know that death was enough.
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.100]   I know the resurrection is promised for me.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:17.500]   It's a hope for eternity for me that I will be with you forever and ever and ever in your
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   kingdom."
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.860]   All of these things that I've tried to fill my life with and find identity in out of my
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.140]   own insecurities, that this world is all that I have.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.580]   I said I believed in heaven, but I lived like this world was all I had.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.660]   I was a functioning atheist.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.860]   I was an atheist.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:38.860]   I rejected you with my actions and now I turn to you with my life.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.780]   Some of you have got to do that tonight.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.860]   I don't need a notch in my belt.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.780]   I don't get a raise if you do, but I don't want you to go through life playing games
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.780]   like I did.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.100]   If you had asked me in college, I would have said, "I'm a Christian.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:58.900]   Nothing in my life looked like I was following Jesus.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.740]   Nothing.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:14.520]   Maybe that I would have showed up here on a Tuesday, but nothing else."
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.020]   If I could tell you what I did most of my life, I would define it like this.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.100]   I would say I was looking at the wrong score.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.540]   I wanted to be a millionaire before I was 30.
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.700]   Moved to this city, began to find identity in the things of this city.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:34.140]   I landed in this sales job, started making money, flipped a house, had a chunk of money,
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:40.940]   bought a Jaguar, bought a penthouse condo in uptown, lived near a bar called T.A.B.C.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:47.380]   that I frequented.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.180]   Had the watches, had the suits.
[00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.620]   I had built a fake identity.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.980]   I was looking at the wrong score.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.220]   There was a game the other day that you would never know about except something interesting
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.220]   happened.
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.420]   It was Brown University Bears.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.580]   They were playing the Bryant University Bulldogs.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.980]   The Bulldogs freshman guard got the ball with 3.8 seconds left.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980]   Anybody hear about this?
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:15.900]   He got the ball with 3.8 seconds left, and he dribbled out the clock, which means he
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   ran the clock down.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:23.260]   His score was 91-90, and when the buzzer went off, he throws the ball up in victory, but
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:29.980]   the other team begins to celebrate because he was looking at the wrong score.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.900]   He lost the game because he was looking at the wrong score.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.700]   Can you imagine some of us getting to the locker room of heaven and saying, "Yeah!
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:39.700]   Did you see that?
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.060]   My resume?
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.500]   Did you see how hot she was?
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.660]   Did you see how hot I was?
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.700]   Did you see how disciplined I was?
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.260]   Did you see how often I went to church?
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:51.380]   Did you see this?
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.580]   Did you see that?
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.820]   Did you see that I was proficient in Microsoft Word?
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.820]   Did you see?"
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:04.500]   He's just like, "You were looking at the wrong score, bro.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.220]   It's about Christ and you.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:10.140]   You living for my kingdom, not that world.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:18.980]   That's why he says, "But our citizenship is in heaven."
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.780]   Remember how they found identity in their citizenship to Rome?
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.500]   He says, "But our citizenship is in heaven.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.660]   We don't belong to this world.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.580]   In fact, we are eagerly awaiting.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:30.780]   We are eagerly anticipating."
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.540]   Anybody anticipate Christ's return today?
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.100]   Anybody wake up this morning and say, "Jesus, I can't wait until you come back.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.260]   I can't wait till you make this okay, till you do away with cancer, you wipe away the
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   tears.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.740]   There's no more heartache, no more breakups, no more hurts, no more diseases.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:48.860]   Jesus, I can't wait for you to come back."
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:56.220]   We eagerly await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who by the power that enables
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.940]   him to bring everything under his control will transform our lowly bodies so that they
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.900]   will be like his glorious body.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.860]   That's how this ends.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.380]   What are you holding onto in that moment when your body is transformed to his glorious body?
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.380]   Who are you then?
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.700]   Am I six, seven then?
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   I doubt it.
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.700]   Do I have blue eyes then?
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.700]   I doubt it.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   Brown hair?
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.700]   I doubt it.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:18.700]   They didn't recognize Jesus in his glorified state.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.700]   His friends did not recognize him.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:26.380]   I bet you everything on my true driver's license today is not who I am in that moment.
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.580]   Is my name Jonathan?
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.540]   Doubt it.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.740]   What matters then?
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:37.780]   Not just then in that moment, but then for the next billion years to the power of infinity.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.540]   What matters then?
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.540]   Who are you then?
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.100]   That's who you are.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.100]   Who are you then?
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.100]   I'm asking, who are you then?
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.100]   You think about that.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:46.100]   Get your mind around.
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.500]   Was it who you dated, the breakup, the job, the promotion?
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.660]   Is that who you are then?
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.660]   Think about it.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.660]   Who are you then?
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.820]   You're Christ.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.660]   Forever and ever and ever.
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:58.940]   Are you that abortion?
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.940]   No.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:00.940]   Pornographer then?
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:01.940]   The hooker in Vegas?
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.220]   No, no, that ain't who I am.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.220]   Not then.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.620]   Wiped away.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.620]   Who are you then?
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.900]   Man, I'm good at sales.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.900]   Not then.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.900]   Nobody cares.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.740]   I was so pretty.
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.860]   I had this many friends on Facebook, this many likes on Instagram.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.100]   Who cares?
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.100]   What's Instagram?
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.580]   No Instagram up there?
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.580]   You see my story.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.580]   Who cares your story?
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:31.220]   Did a sinner of Christ?
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.220]   Was it about Jesus?
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.220]   Who are you then?
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:45.340]   My final point, you are identified by your eternal destination, not your earthly desires.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:51.660]   See, he's dealing with identity crisis here.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.620]   My roommate, he was born in Iran.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.180]   That's why his name reflects that.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:04.020]   Despite my weak accent that sounded more Indian, he was born in Iran.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.860]   I mean no offense by that.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.620]   That's where he was born.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.140]   If I went through life thinking that I was born in Iran, embracing his identity, that'd
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:15.100]   be an identity crisis.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.180]   If you go through this life living for this world that you do not belong to, that's an
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.540]   identity crisis.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.740]   What's crazy is the vast majority of us do.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.240]   The vast majority of us have an identity crisis.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.460]   Very few of you would come up here after this message and say, "JP, man, listen.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.460]   I get it.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.580]   I belong to heaven, man.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.860]   There's nothing in this world that holds my heart.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860]   Nothing.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.860]   Nothing.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.860]   I don't need relationships.
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.980]   I don't need a status change.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.980]   I don't need those things.
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.980]   I don't need the stuff.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.980]   I don't need the promotion.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   I don't need that boss to like me.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:43.980]   I don't need that boy to like me.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.980]   I don't need that girl to like me.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.980]   I don't need those friends.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:59.280]   I need outside of knowing Christ, belonging to his body."
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.800]   Paul is not identified by his accomplishments, his past mistakes, or his earthly desires.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   He's not identified.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:13.740]   You're not identified by what you've done because where Christ lives, it matters more
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.940]   than what you've done.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:21.700]   You're not identified by what has happened in the past because it doesn't exist in eternal
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.700]   life.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.340]   You're not identified by your earthly desires because they were an appetite for counterfeit
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:34.020]   gods and in eternity, your appetite will be fully satisfied by the one true, real, everlasting,
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:39.940]   eternal God whom you will be with forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.620]   This is who you are.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:52.620]   You are what you persevered in, what you are the longest, the sum of your existence.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:57.720]   Who you are is who you are in eternity.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.580]   Some of us tonight, and I mean tonight, we've got an identity crisis we've got to deal with
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.840]   tonight.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.840]   You know it.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   Like right now, you know it.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:10.980]   There's an identity crisis.
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:17.280]   I grew up in a church to a family that loved Jesus.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.700]   Every Christmas after Thanksgiving, we'd set up the tree.
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:27.720]   I would really enjoy as a child getting out this nativity scene.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.260]   It was always wrapped in newspaper.
[00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.840]   Mom would wrap it in newspaper and put it up.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.780]   She would wrap up the figurines.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:36.340]   I would unwrap them carefully.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:41.980]   I'd set out the wise men and the shepherd and the sheep and the animals and the Mary
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:47.100]   and the Joseph and the baby Jesus and the barn-like stable thing.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:51.620]   I'd arrange them and I'd make it look like it was this scene, like the wise men are walking
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:56.580]   up and the shepherd's there.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.060]   I'd always just kind of take delight in that.
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:04.060]   There was something pure about that, something real about that, something Christmas about
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.700]   that.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:14.540]   Then as the weeks would go by, people would come and visit us and they would bring presents.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:20.820]   Presents would begin to surround the tree and to crowd out the nativity.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:29.860]   On Christmas morning, I'd wake up and I'd come out of my room and I'd rush to the tree.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:34.700]   Santa had come and there were presents everywhere.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.580]   There was no sight of the nativity.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:48.460]   It was drownded out by materialism cloaked in generosity and there was no sight of Jesus.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.620]   This is a metaphor for me.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.140]   It's become a metaphor for me at this time of year of what happens at Christmas.
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:02.180]   I believe that Christmas has an identity crisis.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:06.860]   What I mean by that is you're going to leave here and something's going to happen in the
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.380]   next few days and the next few weeks.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.020]   Your stress level's going to rise.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.420]   The traffic's going to be crazy.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.780]   The temperature's going to drop.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:21.340]   You're going to begin that your mind's going to get to focus on your to-do list.
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.900]   You're going to work longer hours.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:28.540]   You're going to feel the pressures of this world at this time where we're called to stop
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:36.380]   and to acknowledge God becoming a human being, not taking off his deity but putting on humanity
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:41.460]   for us to rescue us coming into our broken world to show us where our real citizenship
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:45.020]   belongs.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:52.260]   You're going to forget the reason for the season as some say at this time.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.740]   I share that with you, friends, for this.
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:43:04.140]   It's a microcosm example of the identity crisis of your life.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:12.540]   What matters most in you today, tomorrow, and forever is what you've done with Jesus
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.540]   Christ.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:20.100]   It's Christ living in you, the same Christ that embodied this baby in a stable where
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:27.460]   shepherds came to worship, born of a woman.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.060]   This same Jesus lives inside of you if you've trusted him.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:38.260]   His spirit is influencing your life, carrying you to eternity to be with him forever and
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.460]   ever and ever and ever.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:45.260]   What you're going to leave here and do if you are not extremely careful is you're going
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.380]   to begin to fill your life with things that block him from the world.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:56.780]   You're going to change the identities in front of him, stack presents and things and cars
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:03.460]   and jobs and bosses and relationships and work and promotion and bank accounts and sin
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:11.900]   struggles in front of him so that when people look at you, they don't see him.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.780]   They see those things that you've tried to make yourself to being, the ways that you've
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.260]   accessorized your life.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:23.100]   But in that moment when he comes to transform your earthly body into a glorified body, all
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.060]   that stuff's going to hit the floor.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.220]   And what's going to matter then?
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.580]   Who are you going to be then?
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.100]   Who are you then?
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:41.020]   Because that's who you really are.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.020]   What matters then?
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.580]   I pray that you'd renew your mind.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.060]   I pray that as you leave here this message, you'd continue to trip over it every time
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:57.180]   you see a nativity, when you celebrate Christmas, that you'd stop the craziness of the world
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.180]   and say, "Not me.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:02.500]   Man, I'm focusing on the baby in a manger.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   That's my God.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.500]   That's my Savior.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:12.060]   It's the one who matters most.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.540]   I'm not going to get caught up in peppermint lattes and crazy lists.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.540]   Jesus."
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:27.140]   And I pray that it would stretch beyond the season into your life.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.100]   Father, would you do that?
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:41.180]   Just now as we turn to worship you, would you continue to grab our attention and focus
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:46.100]   our heart and mind on all that you've done for us, Lord?
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:50.140]   We're so grateful for the gift of your grace through Jesus Christ.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.980]   We're so grateful for the incarnation that you came here as a man and lived a sinless
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.780]   life and died for our sins, and you rose from the dead.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:03.660]   One of the craziest narratives, crazier than creativity could write.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:11.060]   And Father, would you help us to trust in that, to believe that all our sins are paid
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.900]   for through that?
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.900]   It's not on our record.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.540]   We love you, Lord.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:20.540]   We praise you now.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:21.540]   Amen.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:22.540]   Amen.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.540]   Man, it's been a long time.
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:28.540]   Amen.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.740]   Man it's been an incredible year, guys.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.860]   It's been silly what God has done in our midst.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:43.040]   And I just can't lose this perspective that if he began to capture the hearts of young
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:50.140]   adults all over this city and all over this world, that we would come and we would give
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.340]   our lives to him and that he would prepare a place in this world for Christ to return
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.340]   back to.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.340]   And I just can't wait for that.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:03.940]   I'm so excited about that moment because all, every single thing I hate, and I use that
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:12.680]   word strategically, all that I hate is finished through that event.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:17.100]   And it's incredible that we're going to this place where we're going to be forever.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.860]   And anytime I've been, I'm going to a place that I don't know, like I haven't been to
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.860]   before.
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.380]   What I tend to do, like for example, over the Christmas break, we're taking the kids
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.020]   to Disneyland in California.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.020]   We've never been.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:33.940]   And so as soon as we decided that we were going to do that, I began to call people who've
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.940]   been to Disneyland.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.560]   Like we're probably going to do this one time and I want to get the most out of the opportunity.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.580]   And so I'm asking folks like, Hey, how do we get there?
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.580]   And where do we buy tickets?
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.660]   And what do we do when we get there?
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.900]   And how do I get the most out of that?
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.900]   I talked to people who've been there.
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:55.380]   Well, if we're going to go and be in heaven forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:00.340]   and ever, and that's what is truly most important, then what should we do?
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:07.380]   Let's, let's look to the only one who's been there and came here to tell us how to get
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.380]   there.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:12.500]   In fact, he's the way, the truth and the life.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:18.620]   He's the door, the gate, the good shepherd, he's God.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.540]   I'm asking you, I'm pleading with you.
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:25.260]   Give your life to him.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.260]   If we can talk to you tonight about anything that I've said, or you realize, man, I've
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:30.700]   got an identity crisis.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:33.900]   There's going to be a team of folks, really anyone with the yellow light bulb on their
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:38.380]   shirt shirt that says the porch would love to engage with you and pray with you and talk
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.060]   with you and help you in any way that they possibly can.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.820]   If you're here and you're in college, we have a party for you as you go out there.
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.060]   Where is it exactly?
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.260]   Stage two, which you're going to go up the stairs and walk that way.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.820]   As you keep walking that way, you're going to see some folks.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.340]   And so you can go into stage two, ask anybody where it is.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:59.380]   There's a party for you if you're here and you're in college.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:03.140]   If you're looking for community, we do have open community group tonight.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.380]   So don't go through this break alone.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.280]   Don't go through this break without community guys down this hallway in a room right there.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.860]   There's other guys looking for community girls down this hallway in a room right there.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:17.100]   There's other girls in there looking for community, super easy place to walk into and just say,
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:21.500]   Hey, I'm here and I want to hear more about this, this thing called community and for
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.500]   the rest of you.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.780]   And I mean the rest of you and all of your friends and everybody else that you know,
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.020]   that's around your age.
[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:32.380]   I will see you January 17th, uh, unless you're coming to the Christmas party next week.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.340]   And so January 17th, make sure that's on your phone.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:41.100]   We have a lot of exciting things in store in January, starting with the new series.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.020]   I can't wait to be with you guys.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   Love you guys.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.260]   Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
