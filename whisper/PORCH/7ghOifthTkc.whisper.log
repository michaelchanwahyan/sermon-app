[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   [Heartbeat]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   [Exhale]
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Love it.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We are continuing the series, Exhale.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   If it's your first time, you came on a great night,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   and we would highly encourage you to go back and check out all the exhale messages
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   as we just explore this topic of finding relief or finding an exhale in a world
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   that seems to be anything but relaxing or providing anything but relief.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And so we're walking through the Psalms where we're just experiencing what God has provided for us.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So hello, friends of the room. Hello, friends of Fort Worth, friends of Houston.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I'm going to start by reading Psalm 118. If you have a Bible, you can flip over to Psalm 118.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   We're going to explore that together, and I'm going to read it, and then we will walk through it.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It says this, Psalm 118, starting in verse 1.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. His love endures forever.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Let Israel say, 'His love endures forever.'
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Let the house of Aaron say, 'His love endures forever.'
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Let those who fear the Lord say, 'His love endures forever.'
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   When hard-pressed, I cried to the Lord. He brought me into a spacious place.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   The Lord is with me. I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   The Lord is with me. He is my helper. I will look in triumph on my enemies.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humans.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   All nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord, I cut them down.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the Lord, I cut them down.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   They swarmed around me like bees, but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   In the name of the Lord, I cut them down. I was pushed back, about to fall.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   But the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and my defense.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He has become my salvation. Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   The Lord's right hand has done mighty things. The Lord's right hand is lifted high.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The Lord's right hand has done mighty things. I will not die, but live,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and will proclaim what the Lord has done. The Lord chastened me severely,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   but he has not given me over to death. Open for me the gates of the righteous.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I will enter and give thanks to the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I will give thanks for you answered me, and you've become my salvation.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   The Lord has done it this very day. Let us rejoice today and be glad.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Lord, save us. Lord, grant us success. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   From the house of the Lord, we bless you.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The Lord is God, and he has made his light shine on us. With bows in hand,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You are my God, and I will praise you. You are my God, and I will exalt you.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Let me pray, and we will dive in.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Father, we thank you just for this psalm.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I pray for the next 30 minutes that we'll have together.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I pray that you would allow us to see more of the King that we just sang to.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   The King that we worship through song.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Many of us have a relationship with the King whose name is Jesus.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Whose name we will praise for all eternity if we know him.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And so would you help us to see him, because you tell us in seeing him we're changed.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Thank you for just today. Thank you for the cold weather.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Thank you for Thanksgiving week. Thank you for a million other things that I take for granted.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And we have much to be thankful for.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And at the top of that list is Jesus. Help us now to see him. We love you. Amen.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Have you ever been, I'll start tonight like this, stood up for something?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And it's a terrible feeling, isn't it?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I remember my earliest memory of being stood up was when I was like five or six years old.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And it was involving something called Indian guides.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   You guys remember Indian guides or Indian princes? Yes.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   You know Indian guides are still around.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's like on a very short list of politically incorrect things that we still are hanging on to.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Along with Aunt Jemima.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And so I was an Indian guide, which if you don't know what Indian guides are,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   it's like a Boy Scout, but you're essentially you go camping father-son.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   You go stay in teepees and you camp out and do these camp outs.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And I was an Indian guide.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And I was like five years old and we had this camp out that was going to take place.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And I was so excited for it. I was pumped.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It was going to happen. Going to go out camp with all the different people in our tribe.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You go out and you stay in this big teepee all together.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And you and your father go out there.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And I went out with a friend because my dad was going to come meet us out there that night.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And so we go out, we set up camp. This is great.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   You know, we're playing with s'mores, getting to see fire.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And as a five-year-old, this is amazing.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I'm beginning to realize, oh man, it's getting late.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   It's getting close to dinner. We have the s'mores, we do dinner.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And oh no, it's getting later and later.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Dad still hasn't shown up. Where is he?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I'm sure he's going to come. I'm sure he's coming through.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Where is he going to come? Or when is he going to come?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And I continue to wait. And all of a sudden, it's like, oh no, it's getting later and later.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's like nightfall. It's time to go to bed.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And dad still hasn't shown up. Oh man, he's going to show up.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And he continues. Or I continue to wait and wait.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And he still hadn't come. And now everyone's going to sleep.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, where is my dad?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I'm sitting outside of the teepee because I can't sleep.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Because I'm in there with a bunch of my friends and their dads who are just scary old men to me.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And so I'm waiting outside going where, when is he going to come?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   This is like pre-cell phone, so there's no like, hey, I got you.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   It was like, oh man, where is he?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   If anything, he may have had a pager, but it didn't allow immediate communication.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And I continued to wait and waited, honestly, until like two in the morning.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And I see this car that pulled up because he had just gotten back from a business trip.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   But it's one of those moments where I was like, man, is he going to show up?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Where is he? He's letting me down.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I don't know if he's going to come through. Will he come through?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   He certainly didn't come through like I had planned for him to.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And the reason I start there is because I think a lot of us, as it relates to our relationship with God,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   wondering like, where is he? Is he going to show up?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Is he going to come through? Is he going to appear?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Like I find myself, I feel like I'm waiting.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I feel like God isn't right now fighting for me.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I wish that my circumstances in my life were different.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I don't feel like God's going to come through and provide a job.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   My singleness doesn't seem to be going away.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And this might, my biological clock is ticking.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I don't know if God is going to come through. Where is he?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And so tonight we're going to look at a psalm.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And we just read a psalm that really answers that question as we just explore a really common experience for all of us,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   including believers of wondering this question.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   God, are you going to come through? Where are you?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Will you come through? Can I trust and can you be trusted?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Can I trust that you're going to show up?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And David gives us the answer to that inside of the Psalm 118.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And so Psalm 118, there's a little bit of background as we just explore why we can be confident God comes through for his people.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Psalm 118 has a very particular background that I'll kind of dive into and give us an explanation and do it as clearly as I can.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Hopefully, Psalm 118 was very unique among all the psalms.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So the psalms we're doing this series, exhale,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   we're looking at these songs that were part of the Psalms, which is just a songbook.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So the Israel, Nation of Israel, had on the Israeli iPod was the psalm book, if you will.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   All the different psalms are just songs that they would sing.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Psalm 118 was very unique among all of them.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Arguably, it was one of the most sung of all of the psalms.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   It was a psalm that was sung to remind the nation God will show up and fight for his people.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And it was sung every year at a very particular event.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   That event was a holiday known as Passover.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   In other words, on Passover, which is like this holiday, they'd come every single year, they'd get together and at Passover, they'd have this meal.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Similar to Thanksgiving, honestly.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Thanksgiving, we think food and football, right?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And at Passover, you thought food and football.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   We didn't think football.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   At Passover, you got together and you thought food and you thought about this event.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   As you looked back, and it was a celebration, much like Thanksgiving where we celebrate the pilgrims and the Indians getting together.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Much like there, at Passover, you'd come together and you'd eat this meal.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And it would be done in remembrance of a moment in time where God showed up for the people and the Nation of Israel.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   He fought for his people and did so by passing over them.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Passover. What does it mean to pass over?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   What took place that led to the annual celebration of Passover?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Passover goes back to the founding of the Nation of Israel.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So I promise this is going somewhere.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Because this is the context in which they would sing this song every single year.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Passover was a celebration of what God did when the Nation was founded.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   The Nation was slaves, originally, in Egypt.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   So Pharaoh, slaves. Remember this story?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Moses is raised up. The Nation is there.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And God says, "Moses, go get my people, the Nation of Israel, out of slavery."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   There are slaves down there. They're doing all the work for the Egyptians.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Moses goes to Pharaoh and says, "Hey, God wants his people back. We'd like to leave."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Pharaoh says, "No."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And so God says, "I'm going to send different plagues."
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Moses goes again and says, "Let my people go."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Pharaoh says, "No."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He sends another plague.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And Pharaoh is just like, "Come on. We can take it. Frogs? I like the frogs. You want some more?"
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   God continues to send these ten plagues.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And eventually, he sends one that loosens Pharaoh's grip.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And it was the plague known as the Death of the Firstborn.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And in the Death of the Firstborn, Moses goes to Pharaoh and says,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "God is going to kill every firstborn in the land,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   unless they have the blood of a spotless lamb over the doorframe of their home.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And if that blood is there, of this spotless lamb, the angel of the Lord will pass over.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But I'm going to do this, Pharaoh," God says, "so that you will let my people go."
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Pharaoh says, "Bring it."
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   The angel of the Lord shows up. He passes over every home.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Or he does not kill the firstborn in every single home that had the blood of the lamb over it.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Pharaoh's home did not have that.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   His child dies, and he finally opens his hand and says, "Get out of here."
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And so the nation of Israel celebrated because that allowed them to go become a nation.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   That moment took place with the Passover feast.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And at the Passover, they would sing Psalm 118.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And remember, our God is a God who shows up and comes through.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And in Psalm 118, we realize why they were so confident.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   God's going to show up and fight for his people.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   So we're going to pick it up in verse 1, and we'll walk through this story of this song
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   that they would sing every single year together over the Passover feast.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   When you thought about Passover, much like Christmas, it's like, "Oh, holy night."
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You think Christmas songs.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   The NSYNC Christmas playlist on the Passover playlist was Psalm 118.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I love it. It's such a great album.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Okay, verse 1. Here we go.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   "Let Israel say, 'His love endures forever.'"
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So let the nation say, "Let the house of Aaron's"--that's the priests.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   "Let them say, 'His love endures forever.'"
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   "Let those who fear the Lord say"--that's the non-Jews.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   If you were not a Jew but you believed in God, you were called a God-fearer.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   "So let those who fear the Lord"--the non-Jews--say, "His love endures forever."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So it really starts high-energy, up-top song.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's like a pep rally where the singer is basically going,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   "Hey, where are my Jews in the house? Praise the Lord!"
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   "Where are all my priests? We got no priests in this place? Praise the Lord!"
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   "Where are my Gentiles at? You're not a Jew. Praise the Lord. Let me hear from you."
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And it starts off really high-energy, up-top, where he's going, "Hey, everybody get involved."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   And then all of a sudden it goes from everyone to just one person stepping up to the microphone,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   and he begins to say why they can praise and define the Lord.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   But he gives us, inside of this, this defining characteristic of who God is
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and why he can be trusted to come through.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Inside of that. In other words, David starts off this psalm and he says,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   "Let me tell you why you can trust God."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   He's a God who's marked by one quality.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   One defining characteristic pops out, and it's a characteristic that his love endures forever.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   "His love never ends," your American translation would say.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   "His love never ends."
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   The first idea, or the first point that comes from this song is that God never stops loving you.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   God never stops loving you.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   If you're a part of God's people, God's covenant people,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   the first idea introduced in this song is that God never stops loving you.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And he uses a specific word. His love endures forever, and he uses the word "hesed."
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   What does the word "hesed" mean?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   "Hesed" is a word that appears over and over in the Old Testament.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Covenant-keeping love.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   What is "hesed"? What's the word? His love.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   What kind of love endures forever? My covenant-keeping love.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   In other words, David says his love towards his people that he has stepped into a covenant with.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   When God looks at you, his love never ends.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   If you are in covenant relationship with him, it never ceases.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   There's nothing you can do to stop it, nothing you can do to change it.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And David says, "Let's start by praising the Lord, everybody in the different spheres,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   because God's a God whose love will never cease, will never stop, because we're in a covenant with him."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   What's a covenant? A covenant is very different from a contract.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   God says, "I have this very particular love for my people,"
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   which would be then the nation of Israel.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   If you're a part of the church, you've put faith in Jesus, you are a part of the people of God.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And God says, "You're in a covenant with me, and that covenant means I'll never stop loving you."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   If you're a part of his people, I'll never stop loving you, because this isn't a contract.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   A contract is you do certain things, and if you do them, or you don't do certain things,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I don't want you to, then I'll love you.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   But if you stop doing those things, or you start doing the things I don't want you to, then I'm out of here.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   That's a contract. God says a covenant.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   A covenant says no matter what you do, I will not stop loving you.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I will never stop. You can run, you can hide, but I will not stop loving you.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It's not dissimilar, or really marriage is the clearest example that we have of this.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It's an imperfect one because of so many marriages that just imperfectly reflected,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   but marriage is a covenant.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I remember when I married my wife, and JP did the ceremony,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and we stood up there, and I looked eyeball to eyeball with my wife, Callie,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   wearing this white dress, and we made these insane promises.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   We took these vows, and we promised that I will never stop loving you,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   for better or for worse. I'm not going anywhere.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   If you go crazy, and you run off to Venezuela, I'm coming after you.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I will never stop loving you.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   That's the promises that you make inside of that covenant.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And she looked at me. It means there were no ifs inside of that.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   You never go, "And I vow that as long if, or if you don't do this, then I will."
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Inside of that, it's not conditional. That's what a covenant is.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I'll never stop loving you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And God looks at his people, which is the church, and here the nation of Israel,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   and says, "I'll never stop loving you."
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And David says, "Praise the Lord. Here's how we know we can come through,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   because no matter what, I can go to sleep at night knowing God loves me
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   because I'm a part of his covenant."
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   He's a covenant-keeping God whose love endures forever.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   He never stops loving you. Never stops loving you.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   David starts by saying, "Let's thank the Lord. He's good. He's rich in love.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   That's not the only reason. We know he will come through."
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Here's what he says, verse 5.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   "When I was hard-pressed, I cried to the Lord, and he brought me into a spacious place."
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   David says, "I was in an overwhelmingly tight place."
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   You ever felt like you're overwhelmed, anxious, feel like your chest is getting tight?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "I'm in this tight place right now in life. I don't know what I'm going to do about my job,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   my finances. I was in this tight place, and what did I do?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I didn't turn to anxiety medication. I didn't turn to substances. I didn't turn to anger.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   I turned to you, Lord, and you brought relief," is what David says.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   In other words, in my initial response, which is so foreign for me,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   when I get overwhelmed or stressed, I feel like I just get angry.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And maybe you can relate to that.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Or maybe you get like just, you just start wailing because you're overwhelmed.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Maybe you get emotional. Maybe you start turning to alcohol.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I don't know what it is for you, but all of us will turn in our anxiety to something.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And David says, "Here's what I do. I turn immediately to you, God.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I bring my anxieties to you immediately. I'm overwhelmed, and I go immediately to you.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I'm in this tight place, and I don't turn to any of these other places.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   I turn to you, and I go, 'God, will you help me?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I'm going to bring the things I'm anxious about to you.'"
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   How much of your life would change?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   How much more would you be able to exhale if you really did that?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And I don't know why that's so hard for us when we get anxious,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   and I'm like, "Man, I'm just really worried about this."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And someone will be like, "Well, have you prayed about it?"
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   "No, I haven't prayed about it. I really enjoy being anxious about this right now."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Like that, it doesn't make sense at all.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   We wouldn't even say that, but it's like, "Of course, I should pray about it,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   but for some reason, that's not my knee-jerk response."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And David says, "Immediately, I'm overwhelmed, and I go to you."
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And unlike those things, like alcohol or anger or anything that brings temporary relief,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   which is why we go to Him,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   He says, "I go to you, and you bring lasting, enduring relief
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   without other consequences for those other things.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I turn to you in my anxiety."
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   He says, verse 6, "The Lord is with me. I will not be afraid.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   What can mere mortals do to me?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   The Lord is with me. He is my helper.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I will look in triumph on my enemies.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   It is better to take refuge," I love this,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   "It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humans."
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   David describes why he's confident that he can face the world around him,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   and it's not because his confidence is in himself or in his friends
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   or in some other person or in his job.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He says, "My confidence and security is in you.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I'm going to take refuge in you. You are the shelter.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   You're the reason that I can face the world around me
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   that feels like it's falling apart because I find security and strength in you."
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Our second point tonight introduced in this text
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   is that God's protection never fails.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   God's love for you never stops.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   His protection never fails.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   To those who go and seek his protection
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   or who will accept his protection, it never fails.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And David identifies why he can face so confidently the world.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   His source of protection are found in you alone, God.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And it's so--I feel like this is so relevant
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   because it's so easy to do the opposite of what David says,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   where he says, "Hey, look, don't find security in other people,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   in yourself, in money, in the way that you look, in any of those things."
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Like, all of us are going to be tempted to find security
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   in the things that David just listed out, particularly two of them,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   as it relates to a person.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   "Don't find security in a person," David says,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   "or in princes," he says,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   "or in getting married." Like, I don't find my security
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   or who I am in dating someone.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   I'm not the person who always has to be dating someone
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   because there's not a me without a her.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And so I always have to have someone inside of my life,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   some sort of relationship that's going on.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I'm not going to be defined by whether or not I'm married.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I'm not--I don't find my security in those things.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   How relevant is that?
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I mean, some of you may need to memorize verse 9.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   "It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in prince,"
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   insert "charming" at the end of it,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   that I'm not going to find my security
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   in a man showing up or in a woman,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   princess, charming, showing up.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   I'm not going to be defined by whether or not I'm married,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   by any of those things.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "Leave alone, Lord," or where I'm going to find my security.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   I'm going to find my strength.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I'm not going to date to feel loved
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   because I'm secure in that I'm loved.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   That's not the reason I'm going to date.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I may date out of the overflow of my relationship with God,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   and I want to make sure that I'm rooted and grounded,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   but I'm not going to date or need to have a boyfriend or girlfriend
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   just because I don't feel loved,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   and that's the only way I can experience it.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   No, David says that's crazy.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   All of those things, if you find security in a person,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   it's going to fail you, but there's one who won't.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Or find our security in money.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   How easy it is, David, or we experiencedly--
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   I know, personally, to find my security in money.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   There's something about where I'm like,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   "Man, if I just have a little bit more in the bank, I just feel.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   The more I have, the more I feel a little bit like,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   'Whew, I can sleep a little bit better at night.'"
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And David would say, "That's crazy.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   There's only one who can give you true security."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Ironically, money, despite how it makes us feel more secure,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   is the thing that we print on it,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   "Hey, don't find security in this,"
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   or "We don't find security in this."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   You ever think about that?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Like, think about it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   On the money, we literally print, "In God we trust."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   We don't trust in these little green pieces of paper.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   It's almost like a comical joke, like,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   "In God we trust. Oh, my God.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And by God, we mean these things."
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And it's like hilarious.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   We find security in this.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's all of those who fall away in an instant.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   There's nothing holding up an economy that's based on opinion.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   All of those can fall away.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   But God is the only thing that provides lasting security.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Trust in Him.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Confidence or security being found in your looks.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   David would say, "Don't do it."
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The way that you appear, your appearance, your external beauty,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   all of those things are going to fall away.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   If that is the thing where you find security,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   it's going to fail you and let you down.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   We see this.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Thousands of moms within a very short distance of here
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   have found their security in the way they look
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and they're injecting all kinds of weird things into their body
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   to hold on to the beauty that they had in their past.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And it's falling away.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And David says, "Don't hold on or don't be defined.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Find your security in the way that you look.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Find it alone in God.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   He's the only thing that will last when the storms come.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   He's the only thing that will last throughout time."
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Finding security in a job or in health.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   David says, "I'm going to take refuge in the Lord
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   because all of those things can crumble.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I'm not going to find my confidence in them."
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   It's not dissimilar to...
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Have you ever heard of a storm room?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Have you guys heard of...
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Friends from Oklahoma, a storm room or like a storm shelter
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   or storm dorms, if you will.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Storm dorm is actually a company in town.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   There's a guy who goes to Watermark, remember here,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   and he sells these things called storm dorms.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And they're these like metal boxes.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   That's what they look like right there.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And inside of a storm dorm,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   it's basically like a box they'll put inside of your house.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   They'll put it in your garage.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   They'll build a home around it sometimes.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Very common in Oklahoma.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Any Oklahoma people in this room?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Three of you.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Oh, man, awesome.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Man, and any...
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Never mind.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Okay, we'll keep going.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Inside of Oklahoma,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   they find different houses with this inside of it.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And so in that, if a storm comes,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I go inside of that room.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And here's why.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Because this is what happens when a storm comes
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   and the houses around you fall apart.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   But those will last in the midst of the storm.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   They stay standing.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   It's a steel box around you
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that can withstand like thousands and thousands
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   of pounds of things on top of it.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And they provide, not only do they stay standing,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   but anyone inside of them, like think about this.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   I just want you to see this.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Anyone inside of that, anyone that goes inside,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   family came out of that.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And that family was protected.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   The four-year-old came out of that.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And the four-year-old, if he had been four feet away
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   to the left, would not be alive, found protection.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And the only thing that stays standing,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   David says, if you find security
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   or you go to anything else to be your protection,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   it's going to crumble, but there is one.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And everyone who goes and seeks refuge inside of him,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Jesus, God, will find protection
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   no matter what storms in life come.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But he alone, like he liked that storm dorm
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   in the midst of a storm, stays standing
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   and everything inside of it is protected.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   God is that same way.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   When all else around us in this world can crumble,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   he won't.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And David says, go to him, run to him.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   In this room, I know very personally,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   in conversations, there are storms
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   that many of you are walking through.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   And David would say, and the Bible teaches,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   will you come to God?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Will you come and find your security, rest,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   protection in him?
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   His protection never fails.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   The world around you may, your health may,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   but he won't.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And if that is where you find security, you win
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   in this life and the next.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   And he continues and gives us further illustration
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   of how God delivers his people
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   in the song that they would sing,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   looking back how God delivered them in Egypt,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   delivered them in Israel at Passover.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Here's what he says.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   This specifically refers to when they were delivered
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   in Egypt.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It comes directly from Exodus.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Here we go, verse 10.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   All nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I cut them off.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   They surrounded me on every side,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   but in the name of the Lord, I cut them off.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   They swarmed around me like bees,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   In the name of the Lord, I cut them off.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   I was pushed back and about to fall,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   but the Lord helped me.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   The Lord is my strength directly from Exodus.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   This is directly from the song they sang
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   after they crossed over the Red Sea.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I'll explain that in just a second.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   The Lord is my strength and my defense.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   He's become my salvation.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Shouts of joy and victory resound
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   in the tents of the righteous.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   The Lord's right hand has done mighty things.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   The Lord's right hand is lifted high.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   The Lord's right hand has done mighty things.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   David refers back and knows his protection never fails
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   and they look back as they celebrate
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   the events that took place
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   where he delivered them from Egypt.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   How did he deliver them?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   This was when Pharaoh said,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   "Finally, you guys get out of here."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Then Pharaoh went back to his life
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and realized it's noon, it's time for lunch.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   There's no one here to make me lunch.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Let's go get these slaves again, guys.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   They go after the slaves
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and the slaves have left the nation of Egypt
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   and they're going to found their nation.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   All of a sudden, Pharaoh's army shows up
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   and they surround them.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   The bad news for the nation of Israel
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   is their back was to a sea.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   They have this entire army surrounding them
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and then their back is to this ocean.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   They're wondering, "What are we going to do?"
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   All of a sudden, God says to Moses,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and you probably know the storyline,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   "Stretch out your hand."
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   He reaches out his hand with his staff
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   and God parts the sea
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and the nation walks across dry land.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   It says it's like walls of water were created
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and they walked across.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   When they got to the other side,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Pharaoh's army came after
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and the walls crashed down on them.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   This is the song that they sing.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   The very first song the nation of Israel ever has
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   is this one right here,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   that the hand of the Lord has done mighty things.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   The hand of the Lord has done mighty things,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   that God is in control.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   God is in control.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   He will deliver and He will come through.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   He says this in verse 17,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   "I will not die, but live
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   "and will proclaim what the Lord has done,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   "that I'm going to live and I can trust
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   "because God's in control.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   "God's protection never fails
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   "and I will not die before God has appointed the time."
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   That as one of our pastors on staff says often,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   "You are immortal until God is done with you."
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Another guy who had a open heart surgery
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   in response to,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   he basically was going into open heart surgery,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   which is a really dangerous thing,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   and was having a either triple or quadruple bypass
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and somebody asked him,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   "Hey, are you nervous about it?"
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   'Cause like you're on the table.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I mean, open heart surgery is like,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   "Hey, one bad snip, you're done."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And, "Are you nervous about the surgery?"
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And he says, "No."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   And they asked, "Why?"
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And he said, "Because I'm not gonna live one day less
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   "than God has already ordained for me."
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And so if so, if I'm on the table and that happens,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   God knows it, He's in control.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I'm not nervous because God is in control
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and He's the one who moves the ships.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He's the one who knows what's going to happen.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   His protection never fails.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   He's ordained and I'm immortal until He's done with me.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   He then says this, verse 18,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   "The Lord has chastened me severely,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   "but He's not given me over to death."
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   That David, wait a second, the Lord disciplined you?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Yes, He disciplines, even His discipline
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   is a form of protection.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   You get that, you see what I'm saying in that?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Like even God, David says,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "Look, the Lord even disciplines me,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "but even in that discipline, it's God protecting me."
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It's God, sometimes God will allow inside of your life
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   consequences, you to experience consequences for sin,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   me to experience consequences for sin,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   not because He's angry and He's trying to get payback at you,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   it's because He's trying to get you back.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   You know what I mean by that?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   It's not because He's trying to get payback,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   He's trying to bring you back to relationships.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   So He's going to say, "I'm gonna let you get a DWI.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   "I'm gonna let you get an STD.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "I'm gonna let you lose that job,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   "not 'cause I'm angry, because I love you."
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So even my discipline is protecting you
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   because if I don't do that,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   then you may just continue down that path
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   and experience more and more pain.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Even my protection is an expression of my love
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   or even my discipline is an expression of love
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   and protection for you.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   It's not dissimilar to, I have a dog
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   that is a Rhodesian Ridgeback and he's like 130 pounds.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   He's like a little baby elephant running around.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And we have a shot caller on him,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   which I know I'm getting judged right now
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   by all my PETA friends in this room.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And we'll use the shot caller
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   because he will run out and take off into the street.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And so right when he gets over to the edge of the street,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   all of a sudden the electrocution begins
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and he starts taking off back into his owner.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   The reason I do that, it's not that bad.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I've done it to myself plenty of times.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Okay, easy guys.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It's a static shock.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   The reason we do that is not because we're angry at him
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   because we love and we want to protect him
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   from running off to where it could hurt God in the same way.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Allows us to experience consequences
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and disciplines his children, not to pay them back,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   but to bring them back to him.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And David says, look, you disciplined me
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   not to hurt me or kill me,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   but because of your love and protection for me.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And after establishing that,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   how we know he's going to come through,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   that God always protects, his protection never fails.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   His love never ends.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   He really begins to proclaim
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   how we know now we have victory in God.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And the song turns into like Queens,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   we are the champions from here.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Here's what happens.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It does.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Verse 19, open the gates of the righteous
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   and I will enter in and give thanks to the Lord.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   This is the gate through which the Lord,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I will give thanks to you for you've answered me.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   You've become my salvation.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   David continues speaking about this like parade
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   and this triumphal entry of open up the doors for me.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The victory is already mine.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   The third idea of the Psalm proclaims
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   is that victory is already ours in God
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   because God is on our side.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Who can be against us?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Because God is for us, that victory is already ours,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   that God's victory is certain.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   The third idea introduced that no matter what happens,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   we win.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   That no matter what we face in this life,
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   if you're in Christ, you win.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   And David says the victory is already ours.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You can be confident and certain.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   He's basically saying, give me the crown of victory.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Open up the gates, start up the parade
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   because I know that my God wins
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   and me with him, I win, David says.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   And he takes a transition that indicates really
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   that there's something else going on in this Psalm.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Here's what he says, verse 22.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   The stone the builders rejected
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   has become the cornerstone.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Come, the Lord has done this
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and it is marvelous in our eyes.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   The Lord has done it this very day.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Let us rejoice and be glad.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Lord, save us.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Lord, grant us success.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   from the house of the Lord.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   We bless you.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And then David begins to lay out something else
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   that's going on in this Psalm.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   The stone the builders rejected.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   We're gonna come back to that in a second.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   But he also points out this idea of Hosanna
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   or the Lord has brought success.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   The Lord brings success.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   The word and the reason I say Hosanna is verse 25
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   is that word.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Those three words, Lord, give us success
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   or Lord, save us, is the word Hosanna.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Hosanna.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   If you grew up in church, you may have heard the word before.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You may have heard this whole sentence before.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   The very words that Jesus,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   as he walked into Jerusalem
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   on what was called Palm Sunday.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   If you ever heard of Palm Sunday.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   If you went to church growing up as a kid,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   you'd hold these palm branches around.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   On Palm Sunday, Jesus walks into the city of Jerusalem
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and the men and women gather around him
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   and they throw those palm branches on the ground
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and they shout Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And David says and refers to this parade, this triumph.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   We're a part of the victory parade.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   We get to be a part of it.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   David may know or may not know fully
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   that he's talking about an event
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   that would take place with Christ.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   But he says, let the parade begin.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Hosanna, Hosanna.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Words that would later be repeated
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   referring to Jesus as they walk in.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Verse 27, the Lord is God
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   and he's made his light shine on us
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   with boughs or tree branches in hand.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Join in the festival procession
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   up to the horns of the altar.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   So in other words, gather around, bring out palm branches.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Palm branches would be,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   they were symbolic of the nation of Israel.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   It's just like patriotism, right?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   It'd be like the state of Florida being like,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   we all got oranges.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   If you go over to the nation of Israel,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   they have palm branches everywhere.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   So palm branches represented the nation of Israel.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   This is kind of our flag.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And so they all gather together.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   We're going, we are God's people.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   There's victory that we have been given through God.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And they start this processional, this parade, if you will.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   You are my God, verse 28, and I will praise you.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You are my God, and I will exalt you
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   and give thanks to the Lord for he is good.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   His love endures forever.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   The David and the nation of Israel,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   because of David's writing,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   would gather together and say,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   God, your love never stops.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   You will never stop loving me
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   because I'm a part of your people.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   You were the only protection in a world that is so broken
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   that will never fail and never falter.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   You're the only thing that at the end of my days
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   will not crumble around me.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Relationships may, my bank account may,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   my job may, my children may,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   my future spouse may, whatever it is,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   but you never will.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   You're the only thing that will,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   and victory is mine no matter what happens, God.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Through you, we win.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Through you, we win.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And they would gather together every year,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   and they would sing this song,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and they'd look back,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and the reason the nation of Israel would look back
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and say, look, we know God's gonna come through.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   We know he comes through.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   He's a God no matter what we're facing right now.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   We know God's coming through
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   is because they would look back,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and they'd point back to Passover,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   the single event in the nation's history,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and they'd say, look, look at what happened.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   We know God delivers his people.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   We know that this took place.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   We know he will come through for us.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And we, as followers of Christ,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   if you're one of those,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   we have a vantage point that is so much better than theirs,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   because the reason you and I know
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   if you're facing a storm right now,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   if you're facing trial,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   when you face anxious times in life,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   the reason you and I know
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   that God is a God who comes through,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   and he will come through,
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   is not because of Passover,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   and not just because of the words in this song,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   but because of something else,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   because of something else this song,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   and even Passover,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   always pointed to.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   In other words, this psalm,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   that's all about Passover, right?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   It was sung at Passover.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   This would be what they'd come together.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   They'd sing this song.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Hey, God's gonna come through for us.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   They would sing this song at Passover.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   It's all about Passover,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   but it's not just about Passover.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   There's clearly something else going on.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   In fact, Passover is not just about Passover.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   They're both about Jesus.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Here's how we know that.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Passover, when Jesus came together,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   he told his disciples on his last night on earth,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   where they came together,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   and they came together for an event
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   that was called Passover.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   They came together,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   and Jesus on his last night together,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   we call it the last supper,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   if you've ever heard of the last supper,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   where they'd come together,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and they'd have this meal together,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   and Jesus and all of his boys,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   they'd get together,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and Jesus begins to open
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   and begin to speak up about how Passover,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   the psalms, it's all been pointing to Jesus.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   It's all been about him,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and the reason why we can have great confidence
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   is not because of what God did in Exodus,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   but because what God did after this last supper
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and that meal on the cross.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Jesus sits down at Passover,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   where they would have gotten together,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   they would have had this meal,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   they would have had this cup of wine,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   they would have had this dinner,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   and then this cup of wine,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and then this bread,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   that both all were symbolic of the Passover feast.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   They were kind of a part of it.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And Jesus gets them together,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and at the end of that feast,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   they would have sang Psalm 118,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Psalm 118, and he gets them together,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and he starts off by saying
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   that the psalm and all the psalms and Passover,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   they weren't about Passover,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   they were ultimately about me,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   the spotless lamb,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   that whoever by faith applies it to their life
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   will find protection and be passed over.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   God will allow to experience life.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Jesus says, "It was all about me."
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   He takes this cup,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and they're sitting at this meal,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   and all the disciples had been little Jewish boys,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   they'd sat through Passover dozens of times.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   It'd be like you opening Christmas presents
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   on Christmas morning,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   like you know how it works,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   you know what's gonna take place next.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   You got together,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   and Jesus at this meal,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   he doesn't say what normally took place at Passover.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   He begins to go off the script.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   He begins to say things that they'd never heard before.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   In other words, they came together,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and he lifted up the cup,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   and they'd seen the cup,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   I mean, it was just, it's a part of the meal,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and he lifted up the cup,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   and he didn't say what you were supposed to say,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   which is this,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "Lord, oh merciful one,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   "make us worthy to live in the days of the Mashiach."
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Allow us to be the Mashiach, the Messiah.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Allow us to be worthy enough, Lord,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   to live in the days of the Messiah.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Jesus takes the cup,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and he looks at his boys in the face
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and the Passover meal,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   and he says, "This is about me,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   "and my blood that will be shed for you,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   "and the new covenant that will be established
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   "by what I'm about to do on the cross,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   "and then he takes this bread,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   "and he begins to say,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   "This is not what they would have heard normally,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   "would be this is the bread of affliction
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   "that our ancestors ate as they left Egypt,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   "and he says, "This bread has always been about me.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   "This is my body, broken so that you don't have to be."
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   That he displays the unending love of God,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   the protection of God,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   the victory that would come through God,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   dying on the cross,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   and he says, "This is about me.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   "It's always been about me.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   "Passover, think about it.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   "The time where God allows the firstborn spotless lamb
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   "to be killed, and anyone who accepts
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   "the provision of that and puts it over their life
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   "will by faith live.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   "They will be passed over and have life.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   "The spotless lamb of Jesus,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   "whose blood was shed,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   "and anyone who accepts the protection that he extends
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   "freely will experience life,
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   "and will be passed over from the wrath of God.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   "It's always been about me," he says,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   and he looks at them,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   and then as they begin to sing the psalm
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   that they would have heard and sang all the time,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   all of a sudden it has to eclipse.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Jesus, the Son of God,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   begins singing out this psalm, 118.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   He begins referring as he leans back and sings out,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   "The love of God endures forever,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   "and I'm about to go show it on the cross."
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And the Son of God sings out loud,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   "The love of God endures forever,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   "the love of God endures forever,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   "the love of God endures forever."
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And his disciples, who had no idea
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   the fullness of everything that Jesus was saying,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   as he's about to display,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   "It's always been about me.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   "The psalm has always been about me,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   "and me displaying there's no end
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   "to which I will not go to show you that I love you.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   "There's no thing that can come against my protection
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   "for those who will accept it.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "There's no thing that can stop my victory,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   "because whoever trusts in me, in Christ, we win."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And he sings as he leans back and sings a song.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Matthew 26, 30 says this,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   that Jesus sang a hymn,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   and they went out to the Mount of Olives.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   All scholars today, they still will sing psalm 118
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   at the end of the Passover meal.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   And Jesus just laid out, "It's always been about me."
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   The reason we have confidence God will come through
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   is because he already has in Christ.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   And so no matter what we face,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   he invites us to turn to him,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   invites us to experience just the blessing
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   of living in relationship,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   but we rest in the fact that no matter what comes our way,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   we're gonna make it, we're gonna be okay,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   whether that's in this life or the next,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   no matter what, we win.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   The whole psalm, I mean, think about it.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Lay out the palm branches, it had to have clicked.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   And here's how we know the psalm 118 clicked.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Oh my gosh, for the disciples,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   the men sitting at the table,
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   maybe it was after Jesus rose from the dead
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   that this has always been about Jesus.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   The stone that builders or the leaders crucified
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   became the cornerstone?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   It became the stone that was first laid,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   the firstborn, the stone on which every other stone rests.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And if you remove that stone, the whole thing crumbles,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   but it is that thing that holds everything else in place,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   it's about Jesus.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   And at some point, the men sitting around that table,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   it all clicked.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   The reason we know that is six different times it appears.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   or become the cornerstone.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Six different times, Peter and all the boys,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   they write, the writers of the New Testament write out,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   it's always been about Jesus.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And we have confidence now in this life.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   We have confidence that we know his love endures forever
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   because of what happened when Jesus,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   after he leaned back and he sang out the words,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   "Let the nation of Israel say, 'His love endures forever.'
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   "Let the priesthood say, 'His love endures forever.'
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   "Let all who fear the Lord say, 'His love endures forever.'
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   "Because I'm gonna walk out overwhelmed
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   "to the point of grief, and I'm going to die
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   "so there is no end, that I, the God of the universe,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   "will not go to pay the price for those whom I love
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   "to remain in covenant.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   "I will not stop loving you,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   "and anyone who will accept my protection
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   "will be able to say for all of their days,
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   "no matter what happens, we win.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   "No matter what I face, I'm gonna make it."
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   And in the end, we win, and we win through Christ.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   If you don't know that God, if you don't know that message,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   that's the meaning of Christianity.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   That's the meaning of everything inside of your Bible.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   It's always been pointing to Jesus.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And Jesus is a God who doesn't look at you and say,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   "Why don't you get it together already?"
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   He's a God who says, "Look, I will die for you on a cross.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   "I will pay, and in doing so, I will pay for your sins.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   "I will pay the debt that you deserve to pay.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   "I will die the death that you deserve to die.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   "I'll live the life you cannot live,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   "and if you will just by faith
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   "accept that Jesus paid for my sin,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   "you will live forever, and you will say,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   "with all the saints for eternity, we win.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   "And no matter what happens, we win.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   "No matter what we face, we win.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   "Neither death, life, nor anything else
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   "in all creation, tribulation, famine, distress,"
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   as Romans 8 says, "can separate us from Christ.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   "We win, and we exhale now,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   "knowing that you are the God who comes through,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   "because you already have, and you will come again,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   "and you've already paid, and through you, we win."
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   If you don't know that God, I'm gonna pray that you would.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   We'd love to talk to you about it.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   That's why we do everything that you see here.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   That's why every psalm was written.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   That's why all of life, all of your life exists.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   That's the meaning for which you were born.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I'm gonna pray that you would.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Father, thank you for the psalms.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Thank you for David.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Thank you for the writings
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   of just men who loved you, and who knew you,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   and who through their writings,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   we are able to know you better.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   God, thank you for Jesus.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Thank you for Jesus.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Thank you for the Passover lamb,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   the true one whose blood was shed
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   so that mine would not have to be.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And who did so not because of a reluctance or an obligation,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   because he really loves us.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   You love us with a love that for your people never stops,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and provides a protection that never fails,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   and through which we can have confidence to say,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   "We win, no matter what comes my way."
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   "What comes my way, and I don't know what that will be, Lord."
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Would you allow us to walk by faith and say,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   "We win in this life and the next."
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   And to be men who trust in that lamb,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   who trust in the meaning of Passover,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Jesus, the meaning of Psalm 118.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Amen.
