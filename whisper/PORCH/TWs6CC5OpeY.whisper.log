[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:26.560]   I never really know what to wear to these things.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.000]   You know, it can feel kind of like a fashion show,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.400]   if you will.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.580]   And so yeah, man.
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.500]   Anybody know what this is?
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.540]   (audience shouting)
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.740]   A gi.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.400]   It's not a karate gi.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.860]   (audience shouting)
[00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.680]   Jiu-jitsu.
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.320]   It's a jiu-jitsu gi.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.720]   That's right.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.560]   It's not a flex, right?
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.400]   'Cause I'm a white belt, I'm no good, you know?
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.920]   Let me just tell you that up front, right?
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.280]   Anybody into BJJ, that's kind of your thing?
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.240]   They call it rolling, you know, you roll,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.040]   that's like wrestling, that's like mixed martial arts,
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.880]   you're on the ground.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.440]   Brazilian jiu-jitsu is really wrestling.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.960]   Anybody, any practitioner, like,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.160]   they got a higher belt, you got a white belt?
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.480]   (audience shouting)
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.320]   Right there?
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.140]   What is it?
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.760]   Purple belt, come on, man, come on.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.920]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:35.800]   I just gotta ask you some questions, right?
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.000]   So, no, no, stay here, stay here.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.960]   No, no, I'm serious, oh yeah.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.360]   We're gonna do this.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.000]   I know you didn't know that, but it's gonna be awesome.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.900]   But like, so just because they don't know anything
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.320]   about it, maybe, so like, if, when I want to be done,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.160]   right, what do I gotta do?
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.000]   - Tap out.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.040]   - Tap out, so just like.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.800]   - No, like, you can't be done just right now.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.640]   - Okay.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.760]   - Like, I gotta get you in something
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.880]   and then you gotta tap out.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.200]   - But, but if, if.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.480]   He said, he said, I gotta get you in something,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.520]   then you gotta tap out.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   I'm like, I don't know, man.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.960]   Even, even the accent's intimidating me, I'll be honest.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.400]   Okay, but, but hold on, so, so if I tap out,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.320]   you're gonna stop?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.160]   - Yeah.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.200]   - Okay, at any time?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.040]   - I got you.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.560]   - Like, I can tap out at any time and you stop?
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680]   - Even right now, if you go like that.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   - You gotta stop, okay.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   And so I can tap out on me, on the ground?
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.520]   - No, you gotta touch the person.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.000]   - I gotta touch the person, okay, okay.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.360]   And so you give me your word, when I tap out,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.200]   you're gonna stop?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.020]   - Yeah.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.860]   - Okay, you promise?
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.700]   - Yeah.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.520]   - You promise, promise?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.360]   - Yes, sir.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.200]   - Okay, 'cause I know you're probably like,
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.360]   there's some lady here I gotta show, you know,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.640]   I know, I see you, man.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280]   Okay, okay, no, no, no.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.640]   So let's, yeah, no, yeah, but I might be bigger,
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.960]   you're a purple belt, I'm a white belt, okay?
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.680]   All right, okay, okay.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.080]   So, so let's just, so when I tap out,
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.680]   you're gonna stop, you promise?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.000]   Okay, so let's just go real slow, okay?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.520]   Okay, ready?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.360]   Let's go.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.520]   You're a purple belt, like, why do I want to roll with you?
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180]   You're a purple belt, all right?
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.960]   Hey, thank you, thank you for coming up, man.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.480]   It's like, why, like, why am I gonna do that, you know?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.720]   Like, so one time I'm here in Dallas
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.880]   and I'm training BJJ, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, right?
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.200]   And I am a big guy, that's true, I'm tall, right?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.600]   And so that means I always get paired with the big guy,
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.040]   right, nobody else is there.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.220]   Like, there's always like one big guy that shows up
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.860]   that I get paired with, which is like,
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.080]   just really unfortunate.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.160]   And so there's this Dallas police officer,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.200]   he's 330 pounds.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.640]   And he too, ironically, is a purple belt, right?
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.600]   And he just works me over, like, he's always just,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.280]   you know, taking me to, so it's like, you're right.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.600]   And so one day we're rolling and I catch him
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.800]   in what's called the guillotine,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.180]   which is like this choke right here, and I got him.
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.960]   And it's like, it's in his throat, you know,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.120]   I'm, yeah, finally, right?
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.160]   And I'm thinking, I'm gonna win for like the first time ever,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   like out of hundreds of times, I'm about to get him.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.240]   And so I just like cinch it in, right?
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.040]   And I'm just, like, I'm about to get you, man.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.200]   And he's like in and out of consciousness,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.960]   but I'm a pastor, you know, I'm a believer.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.000]   I'm like, I don't, man, I don't want, like, tap, dude, tap.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.480]   But he's not tapping, right?
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.160]   And so I'm just, you know, trying to get him.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.440]   And he gets out.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.920]   He gets out.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.680]   So I'm like, I'm like, I got nothing left, man.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.080]   I got nothing left.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   Why, because why am I going to go through all that strain
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.720]   and all that struggle when I can just tap out?
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.840]   And I think it's because, especially in America,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.720]   we've been trained, you've been raised,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.240]   you've gone to this systematic school of thought,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.920]   you tap out, you lose.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.500]   You surrender, it's no good, right?
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.720]   But the scripture actually calls you to surrender.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.000]   And some of you, you might as well go through the world
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   wearing a Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi because you're wrestling.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.240]   You're in this place where you're trying to figure out
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.440]   who God is, if he loves you.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.680]   And he's calling you to leave something
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.580]   that you don't want to leave.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.000]   And you know it, you've heard it.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.380]   You're like, gosh, how did they know?
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.380]   Like, it seems like they're talking to me,
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.220]   like why am I here?
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.660]   Now I know why I'm here.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.440]   And you know he's calling you out of some relationship.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.040]   He's calling you out of some job.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.560]   Maybe he's calling you to move.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.480]   He's calling you to have a conversation with somebody.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.360]   He's calling you to go and ask for forgiveness.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.920]   He's calling you to follow him in a new way,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.440]   a new way, like an all-in kind of way.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   But I don't know if I can.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.960]   Tap out.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.480]   Surrender.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.940]   Because to tap out, it's gonna reevaluate,
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.700]   it means to reevaluate what I trust,
[00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.220]   what I place my trust in.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.540]   It means to reevaluate my ambition,
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.980]   what's driving me, where I'm going, what I'm aiming for.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.760]   And it means to reevaluate my perspective,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.340]   how I see the world.
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.660]   Am I really going to start following this Jesus
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.540]   and living according to his word
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.200]   and doing what it says and seeking to know it?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.140]   And I get it, man.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.300]   I stumbled into this place, hung over, sat in the back row,
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.220]   smelt like smoke from the club the night before.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.220]   And I had been in church my whole life.
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.980]   Addicted to pornography, addicted to sex,
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.820]   loved to party, worldly, as all get out.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.940]   And I was like, I'm a Christian.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.820]   And I had to learn that I wasn't a Christian
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.820]   to become a Christian.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.060]   I had to realize that I actually wasn't following Jesus
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.060]   so that I could follow Jesus.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.140]   And maybe that's you.
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.940]   Like maybe the greatest thing that you can hear
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.420]   this morning is that you're not following Jesus,
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.540]   but you could start.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.020]   You could start right now.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.060]   You could follow him in the way you date.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.860]   You could follow him in the way you work.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.740]   You could follow him in the way you speak.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.780]   You could follow him in the way you spend.
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.580]   You could follow him in the way
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.220]   that you choose your friend group.
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.620]   You could follow him on social media.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.820]   You could follow him wherever you go.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.580]   Or you could not.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.740]   Some of you, you heard passionate people
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.380]   say things like this before.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.980]   And so what's gonna be the difference in this moment?
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.420]   And I'm imploring you to tap out.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.500]   Just say, okay, God, I'm tired of driving.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.340]   That's what I wanna talk about,
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.980]   what keeps us from surrendering.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.220]   We're gonna look at three things,
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.180]   really examine three things.
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.100]   See, I was raised in the church.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.660]   I was a churchgoer.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.780]   And the cost to go to church was really, really low.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.700]   It was essentially waking up early
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.380]   and being bored for an hour.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.260]   That was the cost to go to church.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.700]   I called myself a Christian,
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.980]   but in reality, I was a churchgoer.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.860]   The cost to follow Jesus,
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.300]   that meant what I did with my girlfriend needed to change.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.820]   Okay, what I did on the weekends need to change.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.540]   What I did after everyone went to bed needed to change.
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.780]   The way I handled alcohol needed to change.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.740]   The way that I talked needed to change.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.500]   So I was completely fine
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.180]   continuing to pay the cost to go to church,
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.100]   but I didn't want to pay the cost to follow Jesus
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.180]   because all I saw was cost.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.180]   And I'm here and I'm sober
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.300]   and I'm of sound mind
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.980]   and I've been following Jesus now for 20 years.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.220]   And I would tell you, praise Him, praise Him.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.540]   (congregation applauding)
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.260]   And I would tell you, there is so much to gain.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.260]   And I know you've experienced just a commercial of that
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.180]   over the past 48 hours, 72 hours, right?
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.140]   Just a commercial of what you have to gain.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.620]   But if you have not surrendered to Jesus,
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.580]   you cannot follow Jesus.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.380]   And I'm just saying that it's foolish
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.940]   to live in opposition to God.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.100]   And so as we look at a text,
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.500]   we're gonna examine what you trust in.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.820]   We're gonna examine your ambition.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.300]   And we're going to examine your perspective
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.820]   because these are the three things
[00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.580]   that I think will help you understand
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.060]   why you haven't surrendered if you haven't surrendered.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.860]   And I'm gonna look at one of the saddest stories
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.820]   in all of the Bible.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.500]   And I tried really hard not to teach this story
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.420]   because it's my favorite story.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.780]   I go back to it often, right?
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.300]   Some of you have maybe heard me teach this text
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.420]   in Luke 18 before.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.900]   But when I think about surrender
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.140]   and I think about young adults,
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.220]   like this is where I sense the Holy Spirit
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.620]   continue to take me to say, hey, it's this one.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.100]   And I wrestled with God myself.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.140]   I'm like, are you sure, right?
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.620]   But I'm gonna teach this in a fresh way.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.700]   Now I'm gonna show you something in this text
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.780]   that the vast majority of you have never heard before.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.260]   That I think is so relevant to the topic of surrender.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.580]   This is one of the saddest stories in all the Bible.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.140]   Because most of the time, somebody interacts with Jesus
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.000]   and their life radically changes.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.380]   But you're going to see someone your age
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.060]   in your situation and circumstance interact with Jesus
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.220]   and they leave sad because they can't tap out.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.540]   They said, no, I will spend the rest of my life
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.760]   wrestling with you.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.580]   'Cause I love the world.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.760]   I can't give it up.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.540]   And I know that some of you have one foot in the church
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.160]   and one foot in the world and you're only losing.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.220]   You have so much church that you can't really enjoy
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.620]   the world and so much world that you can't really enjoy
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.140]   the church and you're like, why am I so down all the time?
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.260]   I know why you're down all the time.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.660]   You're exhausted.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.460]   You're exhausted.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.980]   (claps)
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.840]   Luke 18, verse 18 is where I'll be.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.980]   Keeps us from surrendering.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:38.160]   This guy, because you may not have context for him,
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.140]   he's the OG celebrity Christian.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.300]   I mean, he's like Sadie Robertson or Chris Pratt.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.980]   We look at him and we think he's a bad guy.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.660]   Everybody in that culture would have looked at him
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.660]   and he'd have like 2.6 million followers on Instagram.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.660]   Like everybody would have looked at him as like,
[00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.460]   that's what it means to know God.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.280]   Like we're gonna read all his books.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.300]   Like we want to get to know this guy.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.960]   It says a certain ruler asked him,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.420]   we know them as the rich young ruler.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.920]   That's this guy, he's the rich young ruler.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.660]   That's how he's been preserved in history.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.900]   Rich young ruler, good teacher.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.380]   What must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.720]   Now pause, because if you know anything about the Bible,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.020]   you think, okay, he's asking Jesus, how do I get to heaven?
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.260]   This is where Jesus shares the good news
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.660]   that he died for his sins, or he's going to die for his sins
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.980]   and he's gonna raise from the dead
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.340]   and all he needs to do is trust in him.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.260]   But there's some things happening that are difficult
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.460]   to understand in context that I want to explain to you.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.260]   Jesus says, why do you call me good?
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.820]   Which is a strange answer.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:43.020]   No one is good except God alone.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.220]   It'd be a great time to tell him you're God.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.240]   You know the commandments.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.080]   You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.880]   you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.320]   Honor your father and mother.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   And this is where the guy should say, that's too hard.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   I've fallen so short.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.600]   But what he says is, all these I have kept
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.380]   since I was a boy.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.520]   Here's what's happening.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.960]   He says good teacher, the word there is agathos.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.340]   Agathos doesn't mean man who teaches well,
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.220]   it means man who is good and teaches.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.900]   He's saying, Jesus, you're good.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.460]   This is this man's problem.
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.620]   What he's actually asking Jesus is,
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.540]   how good do I have to be to get into heaven?
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.620]   So Jesus says, what do you need to do to get into heaven?
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.660]   You need to keep the law perfectly.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.380]   Do all of these things.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.540]   And that man who is relying completely,
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.700]   he's trusting completely on his performance, says I have.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.960]   Because he trusts in himself.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.640]   He trusts in his ability.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   He trusts in his striving.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.920]   And so that's the first thing as you consider
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.380]   what to examine if you feel like maybe
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.660]   you haven't surrendered is your trust.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.520]   What do you trust in?
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.600]   My hunch is for most of you,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.180]   the problem's gonna be in one of two categories.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.240]   You trust in your performance or you trust in your sin.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.940]   Trusting in your sin, that's strange.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.700]   I'm gonna explain that in just a minute.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.860]   But let's talk about performance for a second.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.820]   Like this guy right here, he's got a black belt in church.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.420]   Like he's the guy that shows up early,
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.220]   he sets out the chairs, he stays late,
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:30.400]   he's memorized the Torah, like he's got it going on.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.360]   He's followed all of the rules.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.620]   So when he says, hey, what must I do?
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.200]   Jesus is really trying to show him what you must do
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.300]   is realize that you'll never do enough.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:49.580]   Tap out, surrender.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.560]   And so this is where he's pulling him in the story.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.840]   This is where he's trying to take him.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.820]   So what do you trust in?
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.500]   Some of you might trust in your accomplishments
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.740]   like this man.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.580]   I did that.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.060]   There was this time where life got really busy
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.020]   and it got busy with really good things.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.080]   I had written this book, Welcome to Adulting,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.320]   had just come out.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   And that kind of put me on this speaking circuit.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.100]   And so I'm traveling, I'm on planes,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.940]   like some of them nice planes.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.820]   I'm doing things I never thought I would get to do
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.960]   in ministry.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.280]   You can actually make money in ministry.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.820]   So that was interesting.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.420]   This was all like new territory for me.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.580]   And people wanted to be around me.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.960]   They're like, let's take a picture.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.100]   Well, you signed my book.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.260]   And I'm like, this is new.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.420]   Like I got in ministry to set out chairs and serve people.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.140]   Like I didn't, you know, like now you think,
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.100]   well, I want to go into ministry.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.820]   I want a spotlight on me and a microphone.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.420]   I got into ministry 'cause I was like, you know what?
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.900]   I'd love to understand the word and help people live by it.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.940]   Like in one-on-one conversations.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.700]   And God just began to do this thing.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.940]   And the weight got really heavy.
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.300]   And I had taught on anxiety my whole life.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.360]   But one day I'm laying in this hotel room
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.540]   about to speak at one of the largest churches
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.380]   in the country.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.200]   It's not a flex.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.540]   It's just where I was that day.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.980]   And all of a sudden I start having panic attacks.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.500]   Waking up like with a jolt of electricity.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.180]   My heart's beating really hard.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.220]   Anxiety jumped on me.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.380]   I go to the doctor.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.060]   Then I go to a therapist.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.280]   And essentially this therapist who went to school
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.540]   to help people like me in my situation says,
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.880]   you need to sit still.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.580]   Like, what do you mean sit still?
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.420]   I'm sitting still.
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.340]   He's like, no, like every day you just need to be still
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.960]   for an extended period of time.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:55.340]   Like, oh, yeah, like a quiet time.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.240]   I get the sense you're rushing those.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.180]   Checking boxes, reading things.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.640]   They're like, oh, so I can tell your small group you did.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.060]   No, sit still.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.360]   Like a Psalm 46 10 kind of thing.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.380]   Be still and know that he's God.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.420]   Like at some point in this journey,
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.440]   you started to think that you're God
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.040]   and you weren't meant to carry the weight that God carries.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.020]   You need to sit still.
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.520]   And so that was my prescription, right?
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.480]   Like that's what I left the doctor with.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.160]   Oh, I need to go and sit still.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.240]   And so I started doing it every morning.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.620]   And God worked through that to heal me.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.140]   To remove the anxiety in my life.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.580]   Maybe that's a word for some of you.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.500]   You realize like, yeah, I've got that.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.420]   That happens to me.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.180]   Jolt of electricity, I know what he's talking about.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.380]   Yeah, I don't sit still.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.980]   Sit still, what does he mean by that?
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.900]   I mean sit still.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.800]   Like in a chair, sure.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.640]   Doing what?
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.460]   Nothing.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.540]   Just knowing that he's God and you're not.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.380]   For how long?
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.760]   Longer than you're comfortable doing it.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.420]   Like wait until you don't wanna do it anymore
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.500]   and then go like another 35 minutes.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.700]   And I'm serious, right?
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.580]   The other thing that can show me
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.020]   that you're trusting in your ability
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.580]   is you think your sin's so big.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.420]   And so I remember when a rich young ruler
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.020]   walked into this place, actually the tower next door,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.380]   and he was asked two questions.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.180]   Between one and 10, 10 being certain,
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.660]   one being not so sure.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.980]   If you died today, how certain are you
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.260]   that you would go to heaven between one and 10?
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.300]   Maybe you've heard that question, maybe you haven't,
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.060]   but let me put it in front of you again.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.060]   Between one and 10, 10 being certain,
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.040]   I know for a fact that I will go to heaven,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.080]   one probably won't go to heaven.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.500]   Where in that spectrum are you,
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.980]   what's the number that you would say,
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.540]   can we just play this game real quick?
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.860]   So I'd love to know who I'm talking to.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.860]   Can everybody shut their eyes?
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.540]   Okay, everyone in the room's gonna raise their hand
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.620]   on this deal, okay?
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.300]   So I'm gonna ask you a couple questions.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.140]   Between one and 10, I want you to get your number
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.760]   with your eyes closed, I'm watching your purse,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.260]   you know, I'm making sure nobody's moving, okay?
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.740]   With your eyes closed, get your number.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:13.440]   Between one and 10, how certain are you?
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.500]   If you died right now, how certain are you
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.900]   that you would go to heaven?
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.620]   Just hang tight, I'm gonna ask you a question,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.940]   you don't have to put your hands up, right?
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:26.740]   So I'll just say, some of you, you're pretty sure
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.660]   you're like an eight or a nine.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.780]   How many of you are an eight or a nine?
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.820]   Raise your hand.
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.940]   Okay, lots of eights or nines, great.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.100]   Some message moved you or something.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.680]   Okay, how many of you are a five, six, or seven?
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.500]   Okay, several fives, sixes, or sevens.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.260]   Yeah, I see you, I see you.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:51.120]   Okay, how many of you are a two, three, four?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.860]   You got a place where I'm a two, three, four,
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.040]   that's how sure I am, the others seem arrogant,
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.440]   like I just, not sure where I'm at right now.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.760]   A few two, threes, or fours?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.880]   Okay, okay, you can open your eyes.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.280]   So that person was asked between one and 10,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.120]   how certain are you that you would go to heaven?
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.300]   He said seven.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.840]   And the second question is, if you stood before God,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.640]   and he says, why should I let you in, what would you say?
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.280]   And this guy, like this guy is, he was the rich unruly.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.360]   Like he was kind of everything wrong
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   with Dallas in a person, right?
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   I mean, truly, like he had, he drove a Jaguar.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.960]   Like let's just be honest,
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.400]   that's like the most obnoxious car, right?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.680]   It's not reliable, like it's just, it just says,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.720]   look at me, I'm Cash McMogelson, right?
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.400]   And so, drives a Jaguar, has a Brioni suit,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.120]   thousand, multiple thousand dollar suit,
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.520]   like he had all the things, new watches
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.080]   for every day of the week.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.420]   He says, how sure are you?
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.280]   And he says, why should God let you in?
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   He says, because I do good.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.780]   Because I tried hard, because I loved him, right?
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:06.440]   And what I want you to know is nobody gets to heaven
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.400]   because they do good, because they tried hard,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.500]   because they love him.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.480]   Even the demons know about God and shudder.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.360]   The only way that we get to heaven is by trusting,
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.920]   trusting in the finished work of Jesus Christ
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   to pay our way in.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.080]   That's the only way we get into heaven.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.720]   And so you might think, right, well, if I say a 10,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.920]   that's arrogant.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.920]   No, to say a nine is arrogant.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.480]   Because you say a nine, you're like,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.240]   there's something that I can do
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.760]   that's bigger than the cross.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.080]   God, you wasted your son's death on me
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.520]   because I'm a bigger sinner than your payment.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.280]   What?
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.480]   Careful.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:54.680]   Nah, his sin is, his payment's way bigger than your sin.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.400]   His sin, he doesn't have any.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.280]   His payment's way bigger than your sin.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.660]   So why not start trusting in that completely?
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.840]   I'm all in, like I believe that Jesus Christ
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.840]   died for my sins, that God raised him from the dead, right?
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:20.000]   If you could get to God by your effort,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.640]   then he wasted the death of his son, Jesus.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.560]   I want you to know that you cannot miss heaven
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.520]   because of any sin that you've committed,
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.960]   and you cannot get there because of any righteous act
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.200]   you've committed.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.960]   Only by the blood of Jesus.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   See, where this shows up in the scripture is important,
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.400]   because it comes right after this verse 15,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.200]   which is where they're bringing babies to Jesus
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.040]   for him to place his hands on them.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.680]   And when the disciples saw this, it says,
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.440]   they rebuked him, but Jesus called the children to him
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.160]   and said, "Let the children come to me
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.960]   "and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.340]   "belongs to such as these.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.300]   "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.740]   "the kingdom of God like a little child
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.200]   "will never enter into it."
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.800]   And what's true about a child
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.000]   is they have nothing to offer anyone.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.200]   Like all they do is take.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.760]   And Jesus is like, this is who you need to learn from.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.800]   This is your example, that you bring nothing to God
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.920]   except need.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   What do I need to get into heaven?
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.440]   Need.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.480]   You need to be needy.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.020]   You need to be at a place of surrender,
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.920]   to say, God, I can't, but you can.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.120]   I'm not strong enough, I'm not good enough,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.360]   I'm not smart enough, I haven't memorized enough scripture,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.600]   I'm not articulate enough or educated enough.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.120]   I can't, but you can.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.720]   And that place of surrender is where I want you to stay.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   That's the place where God's gonna use you.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.300]   You start turning all things over to him.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.620]   So back into the story, verse 22.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:58.940]   The man says, "What do I gotta do to get into heaven?"
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:01.140]   Jesus says, "What do you gotta do?
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.580]   "Like on your own?
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.660]   "You gotta obey the law."
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.160]   And he says, "I have."
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.460]   And then Jesus said, it says,
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.500]   when he heard this, he said to him,
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.520]   "You still lack one thing.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.980]   "Sell everything you have, give to the poor,
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.440]   "and you will have treasure in heaven.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.500]   "Then come, follow me."
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.300]   And I've always read this text wrong,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.620]   like all my life until I would say about four years ago,
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.660]   I read this text wrong because I always thought
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.140]   like Jesus is just messing with this guy.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.420]   Like he is going Ashton Kutcher straight punking this dude.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.140]   Like he's like, "Oh, what do you gotta do?"
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.180]   You know, "Hey, let me give you some rule.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.340]   "You ready, buddy?"
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.900]   I'm ready, and he's like got the disciples there.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.820]   He's like, "Hey guys, listen, okay, watch this, man.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.920]   "This guy thinks he's good.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.420]   "You know, you hear him, he thinks he follows the rules.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.540]   "So watch this, okay?
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.580]   "Hey, it's just one thing you gotta do.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.140]   "Sell everything you have, give it to the poor,
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:53.980]   "and follow me."
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   Watch this, watch this.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.620]   Are you sad?
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.540]   You look sad.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.620]   That's how I always thought that's what he was saying,
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.180]   you know, like Jesus is just coming after him.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.980]   But in Mark, hey, listen, listen, listen.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.260]   In Mark, that's important.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.280]   In the Gospel of Mark, okay?
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.220]   In the Gospel of Mark, it adds this detail
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.860]   that's not in any other Gospels.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.820]   It says this.
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.780]   Teacher, he declared, "All these I have kept
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.660]   "since I was a boy."
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.400]   And it says Jesus looked at him and loved him.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.660]   So Jesus looks at him, he's like,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.060]   "No, you don't understand.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.300]   "I just want you to surrender."
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.600]   That's what this is, friends.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.200]   This right here in this text,
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   this is Jesus giving him an invitation to surrender.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.520]   Will you surrender everything to me?
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.740]   Will you leave everything behind and follow me?
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.380]   But it says when he heard this,
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.140]   he became very sad because he was very wealthy.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:02.500]   He wasn't ready to surrender 'cause he had some stuff.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:08.020]   He had some trinkets and some treasures and some things.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.000]   To understand if you've surrendered,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.220]   I want you to examine your ambition.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.980]   Okay, your ambition is your drive,
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.220]   it's what you're aiming for.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.140]   And the reason I use that word ambition,
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.140]   because this was an ambitious guy.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.900]   The thing that he didn't want to lose was his money.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.640]   The thing that he loved more than following Jesus
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.960]   was his great wealth.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.760]   The text goes out of its way to show us that.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.760]   This man didn't follow Jesus because he wanted things.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.860]   And he didn't want to leave those things behind
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.940]   to follow Jesus.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.620]   Now what is it that you don't want to leave behind
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.780]   to follow Jesus?
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.620]   Is it a relationship?
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.940]   Is it an engagement?
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.500]   I talked to a young woman right out there yesterday
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.580]   and she just said, "You know what?
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.300]   "I just called off my engagement."
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.980]   I said, "Man, that's so hard."
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.640]   She said, "Yeah, he knew God,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.220]   "but he didn't follow Jesus."
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.620]   To which I might say, "He didn't know God."
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.340]   And you did the right thing and I know it was costly.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.420]   Invitations go out, everyone's looking forward to it,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.060]   you feel embarrassed.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.560]   It's so worth it.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.260]   It's so worth it.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.060]   And you're here and you're like, "Man, yeah, I've got drive.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.900]   "You know, I want to be a millionaire before I'm 30.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.300]   "I want to change the world.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.540]   "I want to go Elon Musk on this place.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.860]   "Like, let's go, you know?
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.080]   "I got me a little Dogecoin, it's gonna be awesome, right?
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.880]   "I'm watching, yeah, I get it, I get it, you know?
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.300]   "I'm a wise investor."
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.560]   What do you love more than Jesus?
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.340]   Like, what is it if he asks you to give it up,
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.600]   you'd be like, "No, I can't do that.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.200]   "Don't, please, please,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   "don't convict me too much right now, please.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.140]   "I'm nervous, this isn't fun anymore.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.500]   "Like, let's go back to the dance party.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.480]   "I don't stop this, okay?
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.600]   "What's next?"
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.700]   Ambition is what you're aiming for, right?
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.260]   This guy, he's aiming for wealth.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.160]   That's what he desires in this world.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.660]   I want to ask you, do you believe that Jesus
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.260]   has something better than what you're holding onto?
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.700]   Like, do you really believe that
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.780]   at a heart and hands level?
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.820]   'Cause this is what it says in Mark, again.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.580]   Chapter eight, verse 36 in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.060]   "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.060]   "and yet forfeit their soul?"
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:49.300]   There's an Olympian rifle shooter, Matthew Emmons.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.900]   And I'm not sure if you've heard of him.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.180]   Here's a picture of him.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.980]   He's the most decorated rifle shooter in history.
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.220]   Multiple medals in the Olympics, right?
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.740]   He is the best.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.700]   He's kind of like the Michael Phelps of his day,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.540]   if you will.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.740]   Like, he's by far the best at this sport.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.340]   So what happens, and I know a lot of you are like,
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.700]   rifle shooting, my favorite.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.980]   But people would come to see him from all over
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.580]   because he was so good at what he did.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.340]   And he had already had a medal in the Olympics
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.860]   and he's there in his second event,
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.680]   but this particular event is the one that he's the best at.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.300]   And so everybody's there watching him
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.580]   because he's a phenom.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.260]   Like, he's the greatest at this event.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.180]   Like, he just shoots right in the middle of the bullseye
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.980]   and he's already had one great shot
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.420]   and all he needs to do is hit the target to medal.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.220]   And so there he is, he takes aim at the target
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.740]   and everybody holds their breath as they watch
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.820]   and he shoots the target
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.200]   and he hits right dead center of the bullseye,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.140]   but the crowd responds very different and he's confused.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:59.500]   And then he realizes he aimed at the wrong target.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.600]   He shot the target left to his target,
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.980]   which means he completely missed his target.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.700]   And while he hit a bullseye, it wasn't the right bullseye.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:14.020]   I think there's a picture of those targets, the results.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.140]   So that's him, the second one, it's blank.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.200]   And had he just hit the target, he'd have left with the medal
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.700]   but it's the realization that he aimed at the wrong target.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.220]   Some of you are here right now
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.380]   and you're aiming at the wrong target.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.260]   If I sat down with you and we said,
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.020]   "Hey, what do you most want?"
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.060]   You'd be like, "White picket fence,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.380]   "German shepherd, two kids, with silly names."
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:41.860]   I've got this Pinterest, it's amazing.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.540]   "What do you most want, man?"
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.140]   I just really wanna get and climb the corporate ladder,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.780]   get to the top, own a company.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.500]   I got this GoFundMe thing happening,
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.060]   it's gonna be amazing, we can take it public, IPO.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.340]   "What do you most want?"
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:59.180]   I really just, like a shack on the beach,
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.780]   take it easy, surf all day.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.860]   That seems, "What do you most want?"
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.440]   Avoid hard things.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.300]   "What do you most want?"
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.700]   Him to ask me out, her to say yes.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.300]   "What do you most, what are you aiming for?"
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.780]   And I hope in just a few minutes,
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.740]   what you're aiming for is I want my entire life,
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:29.700]   all of my being to go all in 100 with Jesus.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.140]   Like 100%, I'm all in Jesus,
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.980]   you can take anything from me and I'm gonna follow you
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.340]   'cause we're gonna be dead soon
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.940]   and what's it gonna matter then?
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.580]   And I'm just gonna tell you again,
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.180]   I'm gonna remind you I'm sober,
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.120]   I'm of sound mind, and I'm just telling you it's worth it.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.940]   That anything that you would give up to follow Jesus
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.700]   is absolutely worth it.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.960]   Verse 24.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   "Jesus looked at him and said,
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   "'How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   "'How hard it is for those in America,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.600]   "'in the comfortable church, with the comfortable chairs,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.700]   "'in the central air and heat, carrying their Bibles,
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.360]   "'singing worship to amazing bands,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.440]   "'how hard it is for them to enter the kingdom of God.'"
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.320]   Remember, this guy's Christian 18, okay?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.440]   "And indeed, it is easier for a camel
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.600]   "to go through the eye of a needle
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.120]   "than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.300]   Now maybe you've heard, like people try to speak that away,
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.800]   like, oh, the eye of the needle's like a gate in Jerusalem
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.920]   and camels, no, no, no.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.600]   He's speaking in hyperbole.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.320]   He's talking about a giant animal
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.800]   getting through a tiny little hole
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.440]   and he's saying it's that hard for someone
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.780]   who is so well-resourced and distracted by the world
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.840]   to understand their need for Jesus.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.400]   That's why this text is in your Bible.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.040]   It's a wake-up call.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.800]   He's saying, hey, this is really hard.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.240]   So he's speaking in hyperbole.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.920]   He's like, hey, it would be easier to out-style JD,
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.720]   you know, something crazy like that, right?
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.720]   He's saying, hey, this is almost impossible.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.520]   That's why they respond the way they do, okay?
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.360]   That's why they say, well, who then can be saved?
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.720]   And he says, what is impossible with God,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.760]   or what is impossible with man is possible with God.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.500]   I've said it like this before.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.840]   It's like he's saying, hey, you wanna get into heaven?
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.800]   You gotta be fast.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.940]   And they say, well, how fast do you have to be?
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.240]   And he says, you know Usain Bolt?
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.460]   Like, yeah, 'cause he's not fast enough.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.960]   So then they're like, whoa,
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.640]   well, who then can get into heaven?
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.760]   Because remember, this guy was seen
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.940]   as the Christian black belt, the A-team.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.460]   Like, everybody's looking at him and saying,
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.740]   man, if we could only know God like he does.
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.340]   And then Jesus says, this guy, he's not gonna get in.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.760]   And they're like, whoa, hold on, wait, wait, wait, why?
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.740]   'Cause he can't surrender.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.740]   See, he's got just enough God and just enough world
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:17.620]   to never really have all of God, okay?
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.900]   So he's not getting in.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.640]   And that's why he leaves sad.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.140]   And that's why Jesus has compassion on him.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.840]   And that's why Peter says, wait, wait, wait,
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.060]   hold on, hold on, Jesus.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.200]   You know, we've left all, we had to follow you.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.420]   And truly, Jesus says, truly, I tell you,
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.700]   no one who has, and this is important, really important.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.500]   No one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.100]   or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.980]   will fail to receive many times as much in this age
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:50.020]   and in the age to come eternal life.
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.660]   And what Peter is saying is,
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:54.500]   Jesus, it's been all cost for us.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.940]   We did it, man.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.580]   We walked away from our jobs for you.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.940]   We walked away from our relationships for you.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.180]   We walked away from our families for you.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.300]   We did it.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.540]   Jesus is like, you hadn't walked away from anything.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.340]   I've taken it, I've multiplied it,
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.420]   and I've set it in front of you.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.660]   You're walking toward it forever and ever.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.100]   Don't you understand, Peter, you're gonna be dead soon.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.980]   Nobody gets up to God like, hey, man,
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.220]   why didn't I get married?
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.880]   Where was my German shepherd?
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.760]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   Whatever you sacrifice for my sake,
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.520]   I'm guaranteeing with my blood, it will be worth it.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.160]   And I know some of you are like, yeah, yeah, okay, okay,
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.400]   but I get married, right?
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.080]   I don't know.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:42.920]   Probably.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.080]   Probably.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.280]   But I do know it won't matter 100 years from now.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.640]   I do know that.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.360]   And that's crazy to think about.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.240]   That's wild to think about.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.280]   You gotta have that eternal perspective.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   And that's my third and final point.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.040]   Understand, if you've surrendered,
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.000]   I want you to examine your perspective.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.600]   How do you see the world?
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.360]   Are you living with an eternal perspective
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.680]   or a worldly perspective?
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.040]   Because there's so much in this world
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.760]   that's just a distraction.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.500]   You'll start to think this is all there is
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.760]   and that you have to actually live
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.080]   with an atheist worldview, which is like, okay,
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.640]   I die and I get put in the ground
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.600]   and nothing happens to me.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.960]   Worms just eat me.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.160]   And so I need to cram in as much fun
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.280]   and as much pleasure and as much attention
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.520]   and as much affirmation, right, and rewards
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.800]   and all the things in my little 76 years here.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.920]   And that is antithesis to the gospel.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.680]   Like, that's the thing is there's so many people
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.640]   in the church on a Sunday morning
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.840]   living with an atheist perspective,
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.400]   calling themselves Christians,
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.560]   raising their hands at songs,
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.880]   but actually living with an atheistic perspective,
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.880]   not a biblical perspective, not an eternal perspective.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.280]   They're just living for this world.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.560]   And that will keep you from surrendering
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.920]   because you'll start to want to make a home here.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.720]   Peter's like, we left it all.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.640]   Jesus is like, no, you haven't.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.840]   When I was in college, we were,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:30.840]   I ran with this group and we all would go wakeboarding
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.460]   and we were coming home from the lake.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.400]   We're coming home from the lake
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.760]   and I was riding with my buddy in his Tahoe
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.480]   and right there on the console,
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.200]   so I'm in the passenger seat, he's driving,
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.920]   and right there on the console is this check.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.400]   In his name, for $23,000.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:55.080]   Now in college, I had never in my life
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.320]   seen a check for $23,000,
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.440]   other than like on TV kind of stuff, right?
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.000]   Press, Price is Right kind of stuff.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.920]   But the first time in my life to see a check for,
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.720]   and I've got no money in college.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.520]   Like, I'm poor as can be
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.140]   and I see this check for $23,000 and so I stole it.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.980]   No, I didn't, I'm kidding.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.720]   And so I, I'm just joking.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.880]   Just making sure you're paying attention.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   And so I'm like, whoa, buddy, what is that?
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.480]   And he's just driving down the road.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.800]   He's like, oh, that's that, that's this,
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.240]   this check my grandma gives me every month.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:35.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.760]   Wait, wait, you say your grandma gives you every month?
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.440]   Yeah, man, it goes into this account.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.080]   I can't get it until I'm 30.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.100]   Okay, does she need some more grandkids?
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.920]   Like, can I apply for this position?
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.080]   Like what's, I was just like,
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.840]   I was, I was so dumbfounded in this moment.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.880]   I'm like, you get $23,000 every month
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.440]   that goes into an account that you have access to
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.900]   when you're 30?
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:09.400]   Bro, how do you have a bad day?
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.120]   Like, like, I mean, whatever happens, you lose your job.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   You're like, it's okay, 'cause I'm loaded.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.400]   You know, you like ask a girl out,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.960]   hey, would you like to go on a date with me?
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.800]   And she's like, no.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.040]   And you're like, that's okay,
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.480]   'cause I got $23,000 this month and you didn't, you know?
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.960]   I'm like, like, how, how do you have,
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.360]   how could you ever be sad?
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.240]   Like, I just, like, if I'm ever sad, I'd be like,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.400]   oh, but one day, you know, I'm gonna be 30,
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.600]   30 and flirty, right?
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.560]   That's what I was like, what, like, what,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.880]   like, what is really going on here, you know?
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.720]   And I'm like, I tell him,
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.160]   I'm like, you're a trust fund baby, bro.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.020]   Like, you're a straight up trust fund baby.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.920]   You're a trust fund baby.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.400]   Don't you get it?
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.280]   $23,000, that's a joke.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.760]   That's what they paved the streets with there.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.280]   You hear me?
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.120]   Like, that's a joke.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.960]   Like, you have eternal riches,
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.320]   glorious riches at his right hand forever and ever
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.840]   and ever and ever, more than any money can buy
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.560]   when you are adopted as daughters and sons
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.940]   to the most high king through the blood of his son
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.760]   by trusting in his death and resurrection
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.360]   for the forgiveness of your sins,
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.480]   not trusting in you not being a sinner,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.160]   but trusting in you being made righteous
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.180]   because of his righteousness being imputed on you.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.420]   And I know those are some, like, big seminary words,
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.120]   but that's the way that it works.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.680]   Like, in that moment, God says, why should I let you in,
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.080]   which I don't think it happens that way,
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.360]   but if he did, right, you could point to your resume,
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.320]   right, I'm proficient in Microsoft Word,
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:50.320]   or you could point to Jesus's resume, I'm perfect, right?
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.240]   That's the option that you have.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.960]   You can go all in by trusting in his works right now.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.800]   You don't even have to go anywhere,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.640]   you don't have to do anything,
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.800]   you don't have to change your clothes,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.880]   you don't have to put a gi on,
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.600]   you don't have to do nothing, right?
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.060]   You just, I trust Jesus died for my sins.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.280]   God raised him from the dead.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.800]   Okay, but then how certain am I that I'm gonna go to heaven?
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.920]   You're certain.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.600]   What if I, what if you, anything,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.640]   because it's everything to do with his works,
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:28.640]   that's the gospel, that's the gospel, that's the gospel.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.040]   Like that, like, you know, that guy on TikTok is like,
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   that's what I wanna do right now, right?
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.320]   That's the gospel, you know?
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.720]   Like, that's what I'm trying to say.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.220]   It's his works, not your works.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:47.220]   You are not gonna out-sin the crucifixion.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.180]   You're not.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.300]   That's what he's calling you to, right?
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.580]   If you don't have Jesus, this is as good as it gets.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.380]   But if you have a relationship with Jesus,
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.100]   if you've surrendered your life to him,
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.680]   this is as bad as it's ever going to be.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.380]   And I want you to know, because I know some of you,
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.660]   you've experienced some of the last few days,
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.860]   like following Jesus is an adventure.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.980]   Like, it's amazing.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.340]   Like, I'm telling you, I have sinned in epic proportions.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.980]   You do name it, what are we talking?
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.180]   Molly, we talking weed, you know, whatever.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.860]   We're getting drunk, hugging toilets, strip clubs,
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.260]   right, the whole deal, pornography,
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:32.020]   things that if I told you, you would be so uncomfortable.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.580]   You're like, I'm never listening to that guy again.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.500]   It's all there.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.700]   You don't ever have to listen to me again
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.360]   'cause it's all there.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.980]   It's all there and it's all been covered.
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.260]   And it doesn't mean, like, right,
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.860]   I'm not afraid to talk about it
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.180]   because he set me free from it.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.500]   I'm not walking around all like full of shame.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.900]   I'm like, no, he set me free from it.
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.220]   I can boast in the Savior.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:55.660]   I can boast in the Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.900]   (congregation applauding)
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.060]   That's what he's done.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.860]   But he's calling this guy to the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.020]   And this poor guy, right, like Jesus is like, follow me.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.100]   Like, he could have been the 13th disciple.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.600]   Somebody we name our children after,
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.380]   like Matthew or John or Luke.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.940]   But he's like, I don't know, man.
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.180]   See, I got a lot of stuff.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.380]   But he's talking to the guy with all the stuff.
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.660]   The cattle on a thousand hills are his.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.300]   All the stuff is his.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.220]   This dude's just got it on loan.
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.180]   This guy's king of the universe.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.020]   And he's like, I don't know
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.860]   if I really want to follow you, right,
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.380]   'cause I'm a rich young ruler.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:29.820]   You're a joke, right?
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.860]   Today, dude's not rich.
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.860]   He's no longer young and he's not ruling anything.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.740]   He missed out, right?
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.700]   We don't even know his name.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.700]   Just three little adjectives.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:49.900]   Some of you are here and your aim is,
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.980]   well, I want to be rich.
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.380]   I want to stay young.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.260]   I want to be in charge.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.620]   It's exhausting.
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:14.100]   And the enemy's gonna come around you
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.380]   and tell you you can't.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.180]   And here's what I want you to do.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.540]   What jujitsu does is it uses
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.900]   your opponent's strength against them.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.060]   That's kind of how it works.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.940]   It's like they come at you
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.340]   and you just use their strength against them.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.060]   So that when the enemy says, hey, you can't,
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.020]   say, you're right, but he can.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.380]   He's gonna come in and he's gonna say,
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.660]   hey, listen, you're not good enough.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.340]   Say, oh, I know.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.580]   I know.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:39.540]   But he is, right?
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.540]   And he's gonna say, hey, don't you remember prom night
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.900]   or last night or last week?
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:51.780]   You know, don't you see how great a sinner you are?
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.300]   And you just say, absolutely.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.780]   But I have a great Savior.
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.540]   I have a greater Savior.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.660]   You just use his strength against him.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.020]   Jujitsu that guy.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.100]   What's up, you know?
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.540]   Guillotine, right?
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.060]   And you just tap out.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.940]   I don't need to wrestle anymore.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.900]   Jesus did the work for me on the cross.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:17.380]   I'm gonna tap out, right?
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:24.740]   So surrender your trust, your ambition, your perspective.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.860]   Examine those things.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.820]   I'm gonna end with just some good news.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:33.740]   Maybe we do know who this guy is.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.860]   Really interesting things when you start studying
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.300]   church history.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.340]   Who's the rich young ruler?
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.580]   We don't know his name.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.980]   Yeah, man, I kinda stumbled upon some things
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.140]   that are pretty fascinating.
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:52.140]   For 1,500 years, it was believed
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.980]   that the rich young ruler was actually Mark,
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.580]   who wrote the Gospel of Mark.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.740]   And let me just see if I can get you there,
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.260]   'cause I've been in it, right?
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.420]   And it's okay if you don't agree with this,
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.460]   but for a long time, people did.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.940]   And I think it's fascinating.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.220]   Remember, Mark's the one who said
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   he looked at him and loved him.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.980]   He added that detail.
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.460]   And there's something that only shows up
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.100]   in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.760]   And it's this guy who's naked when Jesus is arrested.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.420]   There's someone there who doesn't have any clothes on,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.500]   which is weird.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.140]   It's a weird detail to add.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.260]   Like, if I was Mark, I'd just have skipped that detail,
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.780]   'cause everybody else did, right?
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.620]   But he adds it in.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:29.540]   It's Mark 14.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:32.300]   A young man wearing nothing but a linen garment
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:34.740]   was following Jesus when they seized him.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.360]   He fled naked, leaving his garment behind, right?
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.140]   And so, like, they come up, right?
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.280]   And all he has is like this, you know,
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.120]   kind of like a robe.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.700]   And they grab the robe, and he's just like,
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.620]   "Take the robe," you know?
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.200]   And he's in his, like, you know, birthday suit,
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.620]   just running down the road.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.740]   And it's like, why did Mark add that detail?
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.200]   Well, because for 1,500 years of church history,
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.540]   that was believed to be Mark,
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.980]   also believed to be the rich young ruler,
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.700]   who sold everything that he left sad,
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.980]   and then he came to his senses,
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   and says, "Okay, I'm gonna sell it all,
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.100]   "and I'm gonna follow Jesus."
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.700]   So maybe he was one of the 12.
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.900]   Listen, this is what Richard Wurmbrand said.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.140]   The Greek word, eutheos.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.460]   Eutheos means straightaway.
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.500]   It's really interesting that this word
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:22.420]   is repeated more in the gospel, a lot more,
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.100]   multiple times more in the gospel of Mark
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.040]   than anywhere else.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.840]   Eutheos, it shows 40 times in Mark.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.300]   We see the word, eutheos.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.460]   The Greek word, eutheos, translated in Luke 14, verse five,
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.080]   as straightaway or immediately,
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.780]   is the most characteristic word of Mark's gospel.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.500]   It is found more often in Mark
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.800]   than in all other gospels combined.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.060]   Wow.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.260]   The reason is as follows.
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.220]   Tradition identifies Mark as the rich man
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.060]   to whom Jesus said that in order to be perfect,
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:58.660]   he should sell everything he had and give to the poor.
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.380]   It seemed to him that at that time, too big of a price,
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.140]   and he left the place with sadness.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:07.940]   Later, he repented and fulfilled the commandment of the Lord
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.780]   and there remained remorse in his heart
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.620]   for the time lost in disobedience.
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.940]   Therefore, he repeats continually in his gospel
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.620]   the word, eutheos, straightaway, immediately.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.900]   What is good must be done straightaway, immediately.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.520]   Only this moment is ours.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.100]   The next moment might belong to death,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.420]   even if we are young and in perfect health.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.780]   So maybe you're here and you're like,
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.220]   one day, one day I'm gonna tap out.
[00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.620]   One day I'm gonna surrender.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.420]   One day I'm gonna give it all up.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.700]   That's how I was.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.860]   I mean, I was raised in church my whole life.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.420]   Right?
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:47.780]   But I stumbled into this place
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.460]   and this guy told this story about this horse.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.140]   It's such a silly story, but I was like hungover,
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.900]   had a headache from the night before at a club, you know?
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   And he just talks about this horse
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.300]   that just wanted to be free.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.780]   And in his desire for freedom,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.700]   he had to hunt for food and hunt for water
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.060]   and find shelter from the elements
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:03.900]   and all these people were trying
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.620]   to capture this beast of a stallion.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:09.780]   One day there was a drought in the land
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.980]   and the horse got weak and a cowboy successfully
[00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.580]   came alongside it and got a rope around his neck.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.280]   He took it home and he put it in a fence,
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.260]   but he loved him and he cared for him and provided for him.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.500]   He broke him.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.580]   The horse surrendered to him.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:30.020]   He was able to lead him to food and lead him to water.
[00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.060]   And it was this line right here
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:33.020]   where the Holy Spirit just rushed into my heart.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.800]   It wasn't until he was fully submissive to his master
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.460]   that he truly experienced freedom for the first time.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.600]   Okay?
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.420]   That is the paradox of the Christian faith.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.740]   That freedom comes through submission
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.280]   and victory through surrender.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.700]   That's what's crazy about Christianity.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.540]   Let me say it again.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.220]   Freedom comes through submission
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.580]   and victory comes through surrender.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.580]   That when you, it's like, hand up, winner!
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.620]   You get a kingdom!
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.540]   That's different, man.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.300]   You don't see that anywhere in the world.
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.400]   That when you're like,
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.340]   if you're at this place,
[00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.400]   especially like if you were one through nine
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:19.380]   on that little exercise, which hundreds of you were, right?
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.220]   If that's where you were,

[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.540]   and it feels like everybody's looking at me,
[00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:31.180]   but this is a, what in a way to end the conference
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.020]   at this place where it's like,
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.360]   I just wanna surrender everything.

[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.180]   I wanna go all in with Jesus.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.260]   I'm ready to surrender my life to him.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.680]   I believe on the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.700]   for the forgiveness of my sins and nothing else.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.220]   Father in heaven.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.300]   Father in heaven.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.260]   Father in heaven.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:52:00.160]   Father in heaven, have mercy on us.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:06.260]   We know that you sent Jesus to die for our sins
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.220]   and we needed him because we've sinned.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:10.180]   We've ran from you, God.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.760]   We've done what we wanted to do.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.940]   You know all the sins.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.900]   The enemy wants to rub our face in them,
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.620]   help us to just do jujitsu.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.060]   You're like, yeah, I did it, but Jesus died for it.
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.140]   Help us to know that.
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.880]   At a heart level, help us to believe that.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.220]   Even the believers in the room,
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.980]   like we need the gospel preached to our heart every day.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.300]   Help us to know that.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.340]   Father, would you turn our hearts to you?
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.180]   Help us to see the cross
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.460]   that you sent him to die for our sins,
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.820]   that you raised him from the dead, defeating death,
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:47.100]   giving us the hope of eternal life.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.060]   And Father, we love you so much.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.540]   We love you so much.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.700]   Thank you for all that you're doing in this place,
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.060]   for the way that you're at work in this place.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.540]   Thank you for the fun that we've had,
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.380]   the laughter that we've had.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.260]   Forgive us for our sins, protect us from evil.
[00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.220]   Lead us not into temptation, God,
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.220]   but deliver us from the enemy.
[00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.940]   If he seeks to tempt us, help us to stand strong
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.100]   by the power of your Holy Spirit.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:20.180]   We leave our sins in this room
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.840]   like they were left in the tomb.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.540]   We go back to our lives different, new,
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:30.420]   a reflection of you and who you are and all you've done.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:36.020]   In the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.180]   - Amen. - Amen.
