1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,720
 - All right, let's go.

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,360
 Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,440
 Houston, El Paso, Austin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,040
 Tulsa, Woodlands, Phoenix, San Antonio.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,600
 The left one out, welcome to you.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,840
 Hey, wherever you're joining us from,

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,960
 and especially friends in the room,

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,260
 we are kicking off a new series called Mood,

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,480
 which is a look at human emotions

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,240
 from a biblical perspective.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,160
 Emotions are something that all of us deal with,

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,380
 all of us experience, they have a big impact on our life.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,680
 So for the next six weeks,

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,640
 we're gonna cover what a biblical perspective

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,600
 on how to handle and think about really your emotions

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,200
 and really look at several different specific emotions

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,480
 week after week.

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,400
 So that's where we're headed tonight.

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,060
 We're just gonna do kind of an overview.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,440
 And to get there, I'm gonna launch in by bringing up

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,080
 what I think is the best part of living in 2019

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,040
 as it relates to emotions.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,300
 And that is that we have developed a new way

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,840
 of communicating our emotions that is called the emoji.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,040
 That we have gone from, I don't know,

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,120
 like when you started texting,

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,320
 this was at one point like the thing

29
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,400
 that if you've got an emoji text message from somebody,

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,200
 it's kind of like, oh my gosh, this person is a psychopath.

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
 And now it's just like we all do.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
 We don't even use words anymore,

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
 we're just sending happy faces or different signs.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,520
 So I put together some of my favorites

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,640
 as it relates to emojis.

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,420
 Here's one that I feel like is most commonly used.

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,640
 Here's what's interesting about this one.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,400
 This is meant to represent the laugh 'til you cry emoji.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,740
 No one is ever laughing 'til they cry when they send this.

40
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,580
 Have you noticed this?

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,180
 Like I've been in meetings with people on my team,

42
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,120
 I don't wanna call them out, Brittany, but.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,040
 (congregation laughing)

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,880
 No, it wasn't Brittany, I'm sure it was Emily.

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,880
 Hey, anyways, we're in the meeting

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,480
 and people will like send a text message to one another

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
 and I'll be on that group text and they'll make some joke

48
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,600
 and I literally, I see everyone,

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,880
 we're all sitting in a circle,

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,120
 supposed to be paying attention

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,680
 and they'll do like the laugh out like four of these

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,440
 as though they're dying, crying, laughing 'til they cry

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,480
 and they don't even make like a smirk.

54
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,900
 They don't even do anything.

55
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,960
 It's like the most exaggerated expression of this.

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,480
 Here's another one that we have

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,840
 as it relates to emojis, hands up, praise.

58
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,160
 Gotta love this one.

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,000
 This is something that I feel like at least guys

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
 would never actually do this in real life

61
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
 where someone tells you some good news,

62
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,880
 you're like yes, yes.

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
 (congregation laughing)

64
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,320
 Maybe some of you would

65
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
 and there's always hope for those of you.

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,760
 The next one that I thought would be worth bringing up

67
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,400
 was oh yeah, the heart face.

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,560
 Of course, this is always an interesting one

69
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,960
 when you get it from like another dude

70
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,520
 and you're like I don't,

71
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,120
 or like somebody who's older that just doesn't text that much

72
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120
 and like I don't think you know what this is.

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,420
 I think communicating here when you send that.

74
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,480
 Or another one being the hand on the face, of course.

75
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,040
 What was I thinking?

76
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,060
 Or the just straight up,

77
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,200
 I'm not even totally sure what this next one is.

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,840
 With the teeth going straight out.

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,600
 Like I don't know if that's angry

80
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,480
 or is it just there's a lot of reaction though

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,520
 as though this group knows what it's for.

82
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,640
 And then of course the most famous

83
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,200
 or infamous of all the emojis

84
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,280
 and that would be the poop emoji.

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,320
 Whatever person at Apple decided

86
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,240
 we need to put eyeballs on this thing

87
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,080
 felt like hey, we're gonna send that one back.

88
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,200
 Tell them to put eyes on it.

89
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,640
 That'll make it perfect.

90
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,800
 Just feels like they've got too much time on their hands.

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,340
 But although we've developed new ways of communicating

92
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,240
 what we're feeling and what we're experiencing

93
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,800
 and some of it's helpful and some of it's not

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,720
 and some of it's honestly not that accurate,

95
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
 what has not changed

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,520
 is that we communicate it through new mediums,

97
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
 the human experience and human emotion

98
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,280
 and our experience of just the spectrum of emotions

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,100
 has not.

100
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,240
 For thousands of years people

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,640
 and the part of emotions being just a part of everyday life,

102
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
 it was a part of today, your work,

103
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,640
 it's a part of the relationships you have,

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,160
 it's a part of every single one of us

105
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,100
 inside of this room and everyone listening.

106
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,480
 That emotions, although 2019 we've developed new ways

107
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,520
 to communicate them,

108
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,020
 the idea of emotions and the human experience of emotion

109
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,480
 is nothing new.

110
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,800
 And so we're gonna launch into this series

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
 to cover really what God would have for you

112
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,720
 as it relates to emotions

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,440
 'cause candidly there's a lot of confusion

114
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,680
 around this topic.

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,380
 Our world today, as much as any time I can ever remember

116
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,460
 since I've been alive,

117
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,640
 is a place where it's a very confusing world

118
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,520
 where hey, feelings mean more than anything to many people.

119
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,600
 And at the same time, God is not anti-feelings.

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,220
 And though it would be wrong to say hey, feelings are God,

121
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,120
 what is true is that feelings are from God

122
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,960
 and God created us with emotion

123
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,620
 and so we're gonna launch into just tonight

124
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,920
 an overview of how you and I should understand emotions

125
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,160
 'cause there's a lot of confusion

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
 and unlike very few issues,

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,160
 maybe more than any other issue in your life,

128
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,400
 your emotions are gonna significantly impact

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,540
 the future you're gonna have.

130
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,840
 Our emotions impact the decisions that we make.

131
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,160
 Our emotions impact a lot of our greatest regrets

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,120
 were made out of an emotional response.

133
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,920
 I was afraid of X so I made the decision.

134
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,200
 Our emotions are a key part of any healthy relationship.

135
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,520
 If you're gonna have a relationship,

136
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,540
 you've gotta know how to keep your emotions in check,

137
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,320
 how to process 'em, what to do with 'em,

138
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
 how to handle 'em, how to communicate 'em,

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 how to identify 'em.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,160
 If you're gonna succeed at work, I mean think about it,

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,780
 you can't be effective wherever you end up working

142
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,240
 if you can't control your emotion.

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,520
 Like nobody is giving loose cannon Lisa a promotion.

144
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,140
 If you can't learn how to control your emotions,

145
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,280
 you're not gonna progress and you won't last long anywhere.

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,400
 And God who's there wants you to know

147
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,880
 how you can control, communicate,

148
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,160
 identify all the different things,

149
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
 how to operate with your emotions.

150
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
 And then the last thing I'd say

151
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,220
 is just there's a lot of confusion, candidly,

152
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,960
 that's been introduced at times in the church.

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
 Where sometimes emotions in church specifically

154
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
 can be given a bad rap.

155
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,800
 As though God is anti-feeling

156
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,240
 or he doesn't want us to listen to our feelings

157
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,360
 and if you are listening to your feelings,

158
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,640
 you should disregard that and just follow your faith

159
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,000
 as though those are opposite always.

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,520
 Or they're pitted against one another.

161
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,480
 Or hey, feelings need to be replaced with truth

162
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,200
 as though those are always opposite.

163
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,600
 At times they certainly are but at times they're not.

164
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
 So how should we think about feelings?

165
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,840
 So tonight we're gonna just open up this series

166
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,920
 by looking at an overview

167
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,560
 of how to understand human emotions.

168
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,340
 So I'm gonna go through three different ideas

169
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,000
 that we see inside of the scriptures

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,160
 that will cover as it relates to emotions,

171
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
 how to think about it.

172
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,560
 This, in just reading a few books for this message

173
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,840
 this past week was so helpful in ministry to me.

174
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,180
 So hopefully it's gonna be really helpful.

175
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,720
 I think for some of us, if you listen and apply,

176
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,080
 just like myself, it will be life-changing for you

177
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,760
 because you came into this room right now

178
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,520
 and you are governed by emotion.

179
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,840
 You're overwhelmed, you're struggling to even listen to me

180
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,040
 because of the things that you're feeling

181
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
 and you're gonna struggle to become

182
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,240
 all that God wants you to be and all that you can be

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,840
 if you're not someone who knows how to handle their emotions.

184
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,720
 So we're gonna look at three things.

185
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
 If you take notes, you can start with the first one

186
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
 and the first one is this.

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,620
 Emotions are a gift from God.

188
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,660
 Emotions are a gift from God.

189
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,420
 In other words, emotions are not a bad thing.

190
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,660
 Emotions are a gift.

191
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,900
 Emotions were given to us to enhance the human experience.

192
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,420
 They weren't given to be exalted.

193
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,140
 They weren't given to be excluded from life.

194
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,140
 They were given by God to enhance the human experience

195
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,440
 and particularly to move us out of that emotion.

196
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,980
 The word emotion comes from the Latin word mover, to move,

197
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
 and to move us in the direction of God.

198
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,460
 Think about life when I say enhanced.

199
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,800
 Think about what life would be like

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
 if you didn't experience emotion.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,160
 I mean, think about the person who's getting engaged

202
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,920
 and their specialist, someone gets down on one knee

203
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,760
 or you get down on one knee and you propose

204
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,020
 and you feel nothing inside.

205
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,920
 You're like, I don't really care.

206
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,200
 Take it or leave it, I'm fine with this.

207
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,480
 You would be like, that person is dead on the inside.

208
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,440
 Life would not be as exciting as that.

209
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,480
 If you heard news of a family member who had cancer

210
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,280
 and then they came back from a doctor's scan

211
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,920
 and it was a clean bill of health.

212
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,240
 If someone didn't react, oh my gosh, I'm relieved.

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,160
 I feel something.

214
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,140
 You'd be like, that is just bizarre or weird.

215
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,740
 That emotions are a part of our relationships.

216
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,900
 If you don't get excited to be around other people,

217
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,500
 how dull would your relationships be?

218
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,300
 You wouldn't have friendships

219
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,580
 at the same degree and same level.

220
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,200
 That emotions bring out,

221
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,140
 it's as though they were the sixth sense, if you will.

222
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,460
 You have taste and feeling and smell and sight and hearing

223
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,620
 and then God has given us emotions

224
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,940
 to be a part of the human experience.

225
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,420
 Emotions are a gift further

226
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,760
 and that they're a reflection of the image of God.

227
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,860
 In other words, you were made in the image of God,

228
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,740
 in the image of a God who feels.

229
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,180
 You guys may not ever think about this stuff,

230
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,300
 but you know the Bible says that God feels things?

231
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,540
 Like how crazy and interesting is that?

232
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,020
 Like God has, as though it were a heart, if you will,

233
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,420
 he feels things.

234
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,760
 We're told in really tons of different places,

235
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,640
 but some of the things that God felt angered

236
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,100
 at the Israelites in Deuteronomy chapter one, verse 34,

237
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,660
 he felt pleased at Solomon's decision.

238
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,020
 In 1 Kings chapter three, verse 10,

239
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,740
 it says that he's filled with joy and gladness

240
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,340
 over his people and glad singing.

241
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,380
 The heart of God moves towards,

242
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,140
 in Zephaniah chapter three, verse 17,

243
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,020
 that God's heart grieves.

244
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,900
 In Genesis chapter six, verse six,

245
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,600
 Jesus was over and over again moved by emotion.

246
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,820
 Paul, the apostle, would say that in Ephesians chapter four,

247
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,100
 it is possible to grieve the Holy Spirit.

248
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,820
 Think about that.

249
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,020
 That the God who's there is not some cold, distant robot.

250
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,140
 He has emotions, and you were made in his image

251
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,380
 with emotions, and they're a gift that he has given

252
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,420
 to move you and to move you in the direction of him.

253
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,360
 Further, we're commanded in the New Testament

254
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,940
 to express emotions.

255
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,060
 Paul says in Romans 12,

256
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,420
 it's really all over the New Testament,

257
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,700
 but hey, rejoice with those who rejoice,

258
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,540
 mourn with those who mourn,

259
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,440
 that God says, hey, it is a command.

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,580
 I want my people to feel.

261
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,540
 So if you came in and you're like,

262
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,060
 hey, emotions are a bad thing,

263
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,500
 or emotions are just something I wish

264
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,620
 that I could get rid of,

265
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,100
 or emotions are something that God probably

266
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,980
 doesn't want me to listen to

267
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,860
 or ever have a part of my life,

268
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,940
 you have been misled.

269
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,340
 We say that, hey, it's,

270
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,580
 often you'll hear people say, like,

271
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,900
 hey, it's not okay to be led by emotion.

272
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,700
 That is wrong.

273
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,460
 It's not okay to be led by emotion to sin.

274
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,620
 Jesus was led by emotion.

275
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,680
 So before I get an email, it says,

276
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,400
 Jesus, in Mark chapter one,

277
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,720
 was moved by emotion and compassion

278
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,000
 towards a man who had leprosy.

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,160
 That he was moved over and over again.

280
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,000
 I mean, read your Bible.

281
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,120
 Jesus, over and over, was moved.

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,320
 What's another word for moved?

283
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,160
 Led.

284
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,520
 And moved him to act.

285
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,720
 Now, it's the wrong thing to be led

286
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,000
 always by emotions, and especially in the direction

287
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
 that goes opposite of God's will,

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,140
 but candidly, the problem is not emotions, it's sin.

289
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
 People will say things like,

290
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,080
 hey, you know, in that situation,

291
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,000
 my emotions got the better of me.

292
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,800
 The truth is, it wasn't your emotions,

293
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,640
 it's sin got the better of your emotions.

294
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,360
 That's what's taking place.

295
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,080
 Emotions are not a bad thing in and of themselves.

296
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,200
 But if they lead you to sin,

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,980
 is when it is wrong to be led by emotions.

298
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,080
 But emotions are this gift that God has given to all of us.

299
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,880
 The Bible says that in response,

300
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,760
 as it relates to the idea of,

301
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,320
 hey, they're to move us towards God.

302
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,780
 James chapter five, verse 13, says that,

303
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,080
 hey, is anyone joyful?

304
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,180
 Let him praise God and sing aloud.

305
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,440
 If anyone is afraid, even if you have negative emotions,

306
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
 God's hope is that all the different things

307
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,720
 that you felt today would be things

308
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,200
 that you would bring to him.

309
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,160
 Either lead you to respond and praise to him,

310
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,780
 or lead you to pray to him.

311
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,960
 It says that, hey, in Psalm 56,

312
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,160
 when I am afraid, when I am filled with fear,

313
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,080
 I trust and put my trust in you.

314
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,040
 So why do they feel not like a gift sometimes?

315
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,460
 Because sin.

316
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,500
 In other words, when God created the world,

317
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,740
 he created you and I and humanity

318
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,260
 with this ability to have emotions in our mind,

319
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,380
 in our will, and sin entered into the world

320
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,740
 through Adam and Eve and their decision,

321
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,260
 and when that happened, everything broke.

322
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,140
 And now, literally, everything on the planet

323
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,660
 has some assembly required, including your emotions.

324
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,540
 And so this gift that God has given you

325
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,860
 is one of those things that it doesn't just naturally,

326
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,580
 today, you can have emotions that will lead you to craziness.

327
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,560
 And if you follow the sinful emotions,

328
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,520
 they're gonna take you down a path

329
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,360
 that you don't wanna go to.

330
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,880
 So today, because sin has entered into the world,

331
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,760
 the gift of human emotion is one of those gifts

332
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,960
 that just kinda requires, it's some assembly required.

333
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,880
 There's things that God, thankfully, in his word,

334
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,840
 has said this is how you would operate now

335
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,740
 with your emotions.

336
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,920
 You know what I mean by some assembly?

337
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,420
 Anyone been given a gift recently

338
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,120
 that has some assembly required?

339
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
 Anyone given a gift from Ikea?

340
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,960
 You ever had that happen where it shows up at your door

341
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
 and you're like, oh my goodness,

342
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,100
 I'm gonna be doing this for the next seven days, okay?

343
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,620
 That's essentially what God has given us

344
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,240
 inside of your human emotions.

345
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,580
 And through the gospel and through following Jesus,

346
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,120
 that is a part of the thing that he says

347
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,600
 I'm here to reconcile and bring peace about to all things,

348
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,440
 your heart, your emotions, your mind,

349
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,880
 your relationships, and all things.

350
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,080
 And so for the next couple points,

351
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,980
 I wanna just talk about two more aspects

352
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,060
 of how that assembly takes place.

353
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,620
 And the starting point for that assembly

354
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,220
 is gonna be the second point, if you take notes,

355
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,580
 which is this, emotions are not just a gift,

356
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,740
 they are a gauge.

357
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,180
 Emotions are a gauge, you know what I mean by gauge?

358
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,620
 Like they tell you something.

359
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,320
 Just like a gauge on the dashboard of your car,

360
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,780
 it tells you, it indicates something.

361
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,460
 Emotions are meant to be an indicator,

362
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,760
 or they tell you something.

363
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,320
 Anytime that you feel something,

364
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,500
 it reflects something inside.

365
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,620
 And I'm gonna tell you exactly what I mean

366
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,380
 in case you're like, what does that have to do with my life?

367
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,300
 What are you talking about?

368
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,840
 In Proverbs 37, verse 19, it says this.

369
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,260
 As water reflects the face, so when you look in the water,

370
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,580
 you see the reflection of your face.

371
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,420
 So one's life, that's one's actions and emotions,

372
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,820
 reflects one's heart.

373
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,360
 In other words, what your life looks like,

374
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,300
 hey, how you act, how you feel,

375
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,720
 what emotions you're experiencing,

376
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,240
 what actions you do, are directly reflecting

377
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
 what's in your heart.

378
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,660
 In other words, you can see what's in your heart,

379
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,700
 but based on what emotions you're experiencing.

380
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,620
 And specifically, when it talks about a gauge,

381
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,180
 what are you reading,

382
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,580
 we're told that it reads two specific things.

383
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,940
 But before we go into that,

384
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
 when I, about a week or two ago,

385
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,920
 I was hanging out with my three-year-old son.

386
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,860
 We're sitting there, we're reading books on the couch.

387
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,620
 He loves books, he's so pumped about books,

388
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,460
 but he can't read.

389
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,420
 So we're sitting there and we're going through,

390
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,900
 and he's like, hey, what does this say over here?

391
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,860
 And one time, I don't know what I was thinking,

392
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,480
 but I was like, what do you think that says,

393
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
 or what does it say?

394
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,140
 And he looks at me point blank,

395
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,580
 and it was the greatest thing ever.

396
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,940
 He was like, I don't know, I can't read.

397
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,180
 (congregation laughing)

398
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,620
 I was like, I'm three, what are you asking me this for?

399
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,140
 I can't read.

400
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,500
 And then shortly after that, he began to talk about,

401
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,580
 I can't wait 'til the day that I can read books.

402
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,060
 I can sit on my bed and I can read all by myself.

403
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,520
 Hopefully that day comes,

404
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,900
 but even as important as that,

405
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,300
 is the day that comes for his ability to grow,

406
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,740
 to read emotions, to read his own emotions,

407
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,300
 to read the emotions of people around him.

408
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,740
 And though most of us learn at some point

409
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,780
 how to read and write, especially in America,

410
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,580
 tragically, very few of us ever learn

411
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,620
 how to read your emotions because they are a gauge.

412
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,380
 Whatever you're feeling right now

413
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,560
 is a gauge of what's going on inside of your heart,

414
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
 and specifically, it is a gauge of two things,

415
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,660
 and this is about to get heady.

416
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,360
 Everybody put their thinking cap on

417
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,580
 'cause I think this is gonna be

418
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,540
 profoundly helpful from God's word,

419
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,360
 but it'll take a little bit of thinking.

420
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,460
 What does it tell me?

421
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,300
 What is it reading?

422
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,180
 What is it a gauge of?

423
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,220
 Specifically, two things, your beliefs and your values.

424
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,620
 Anytime you have a human emotion,

425
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,780
 it reflects the intersection of something I value,

426
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,100
 I care about, that I find worth or a desire of mine,

427
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,660
 and something I believe.

428
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,180
 Every single time, there's a human expression.

429
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,480
 I think we've got a slide that'll put this up.

430
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,520
 So every single time, in other words, there's a value,

431
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,860
 there's something that, if I don't see it as valuable,

432
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,820
 I'm not gonna experience a human emotion.

433
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,680
 When I see a squirrel running in the middle of the street,

434
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,980
 I feel nothing.

435
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,420
 I'm dead on the inside.

436
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,900
 When I see a child, and this is not anti-squirrel,

437
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
 I'm just being honest, people, good grief.

438
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,540
 Thought this was a safe place.

439
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,420
 Bunch of squirrel hippies out here.

440
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,080
 When I see a squirrel running in the middle of the street,

441
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,380
 I'm like, I don't care, this car's coming,

442
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,900
 and they do it all the time, good luck.

443
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,900
 When I see a child, good grief, squirrel,

444
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,500
 is this a PETA gathering?

445
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,260
 When I see a child running in the street,

446
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,380
 I move with emotion, get out of the road,

447
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,220
 because I value it more than a squirrel.

448
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,220
 When I see my child, I'm very moved with emotion

449
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,900
 to act and get out of the way and fear and panic

450
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,220
 and all those emotions go through my heart,

451
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
 because it's a value thing.

452
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,980
 If you don't value something, if you don't care about it,

453
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,420
 if you have no worth that you find it,

454
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,660
 then you're not gonna experience

455
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,100
 any sort of emotion to that.

456
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,780
 The same is true as it relates to beliefs.

457
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,220
 That in order for you to experience emotion,

458
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,980
 you've gotta have, it's wherever the intersection

459
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,140
 and overlap of beliefs and values take place.

460
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,460
 What do I mean by belief?

461
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,420
 What you believe about a circumstance,

462
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,100
 what you think is kinda going on,

463
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,540
 will impact how your emotions are affected.

464
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,340
 What's an example?

465
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,260
 This past weekend, if you were to go to lunch

466
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,540
 with your mother on Mother's Day,

467
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,020
 'cause you're a great son or daughter,

468
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,100
 and you were to call her up and you said,

469
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,620
 hey, I'll meet you at this restaurant,

470
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,940
 we're going to lunch, and you went

471
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,980
 and you got to that restaurant and you waited

472
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,780
 and you were supposed to meet there at 12,

473
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,520
 and all of a sudden it's like 12, 20,

474
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,300
 and you've texted her several times,

475
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,620
 you're calling her, her phone won't answer.

476
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,340
 If you believe that she has gotten in a wreck

477
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,140
 or an accident, you're gonna be moved towards panic

478
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,240
 and I need to go find her and what should I do?

479
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,620
 If you believe she's stuck in traffic

480
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,140
 and that her phone is dead 'cause she never charges it,

481
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,660
 you're gonna just get back on your phone

482
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,080
 and keep sending emojis.

483
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,300
 You're not gonna be moved in the same way.

484
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,860
 Every single time, this is so huge,

485
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,480
 and this is going somewhere, because candidly,

486
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,100
 if I just said, hey, if you're sad in here,

487
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,480
 stop feeling sad!

488
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,520
 That may be like, oh, motivational,

489
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
 or yeah, that's a great idea.

490
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,020
 It's not gonna work.

491
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,600
 Because if you don't get to what the Bible

492
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,320
 in Hebrews chapter four says is the thoughts

493
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,500
 or beliefs and desires of the heart,

494
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,680
 and go at those with God's word,

495
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,460
 you will not experience freedom or any victory

496
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,320
 in the battle against your emotions.

497
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,840
 So you've gotta understand the battle

498
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,120
 or the battlefront that you are fighting on.

499
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,600
 And it is related to beliefs and emotions

500
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
 every single time, that your emotions are a gauge

501
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,880
 that tell you what is taking place on the inside.

502
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,800
 So let's use a couple examples.

503
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,600
 Let's say you go to a wedding,

504
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,000
 and this past weekend you're at a wedding,

505
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,120
 it's one of your friends, and you're single

506
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,920
 and not dating anyone, and they put you

507
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,240
 at the singles table, and you're watching everybody

508
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,040
 dance over there, and it's your roommate,

509
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,880
 just got married.

510
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,240
 Maybe you're the only one left in kind of your squad,

511
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,640
 friend group, who's not married yet.

512
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,000
 And you begin to be filled with sadness.

513
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,440
 That's an emotion, the feeling of sadness.

514
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,740
 What am I believing?

515
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,520
 Could be a number of different things.

516
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,320
 But let's just continue with the illustration.

517
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,120
 Likely what you value is getting married,

518
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,280
 and staying up with the stage of life your friends are in.

519
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,980
 You're like, oh man, I don't wanna be behind.

520
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,040
 Everybody else is kinda moving on with their life.

521
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,100
 I'm just 33 and single, it's moving on for me.

522
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,320
 So that's the thing that you value,

523
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
 and the belief you have could be any number of things,

524
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,060
 but likely it's something like I believe,

525
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,060
 and I'm afraid that I may always be single.

526
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,840
 Maybe you're sad 'cause you're like,

527
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,220
 I think God is punishing me for my past.

528
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,380
 Maybe you think, man, I should've married him,

529
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,360
 that one that got away, because there's an intersection

530
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
 of what you believe and what you value.

531
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,640
 Every time there's a human emotion,

532
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,440
 it is connected to these two things.

533
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,380
 Which is a very important thing.

534
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,520
 If you are going to learn to fight, and battle,

535
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,960
 and win in the human emotion,

536
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,560
 it is gonna take place by doing this.

537
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,380
 What's another example?

538
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,760
 Maybe you're at work, and your team is together,

539
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,880
 and they're asking for ideas for some new problem

540
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,680
 you're trying to solve, and you throw one out there.

541
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,400
 The response you get is kind of like,

542
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,720
 anybody else have any ideas, or it's dismissed,

543
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,540
 or it's even like, that's a terrible idea.

544
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,440
 You're gonna leave that meeting,

545
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,040
 and you're gonna feel emotion.

546
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,800
 You're gonna feel embarrassed, and anxious

547
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,000
 over whether or not I'm gonna have a job here much longer.

548
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,640
 Those are the emotions you're gonna feel.

549
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
 And why?

550
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,640
 Because there's a belief and a value

551
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 that is a part of those things.

552
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,920
 You believe that you're anxious or embarrassed,

553
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,540
 that maybe, hey, I just ruined my shot,

554
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,040
 I'm not gonna get promoted around here,

555
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,260
 my boss thinks I'm incompetent or dumb.

556
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,280
 That's what you believe.

557
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,080
 And you value your job, you value what your boss thinks.

558
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,200
 You guys following me on this?

559
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,320
 Every single time that you experience an emotion,

560
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,940
 it is connected, even if it's a positive emotion.

561
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,520
 And the degree to which you experience that emotion

562
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,800
 is directly related to the degree of the emotion,

563
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,300
 or the degree of the belief and the value.

564
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,920
 The greater the value, and the greater the belief,

565
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,760
 or my perception of what's happening is,

566
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
 the greater the emotion.

567
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,320
 So you go back to my child running in the street,

568
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,720
 just like from a squirrel to another child to my child,

569
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,300
 that ramps up my emotion.

570
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,860
 And the greater likelihood of belief that I have

571
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,920
 that there's a car coming fast will increase my emotion.

572
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,760
 You guys following me on this?

573
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,320
 I know thinking caps are on.

574
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,960
 If you checked out, come back in.

575
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,200
 And know this, that if you're gonna experience freedom,

576
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,520
 it's gonna be related to you knowing,

577
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,480
 because the Bible says, it uses these words,

578
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,940
 your beliefs or your values, your beliefs and your values,

579
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,320
 are directly behind what your heart is expressing.

580
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,560
 And that's why the Bible says you and I

581
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,820
 have got to learn to combat them with God's word.

582
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,480
 And I'm gonna tell you a story.

583
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,800
