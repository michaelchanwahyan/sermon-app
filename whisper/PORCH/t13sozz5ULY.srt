1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,880
 (soft music)

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:28,300
 About a year and a half ago,

4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,040
 I was walking through my house

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,520
 and there's a hallway that leads to the master bedroom.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,840
 And as I was walking down this hallway,

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,880
 as I do several times a day,

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,760
 there's a little closet where we keep some suitcases in.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,400
 I passed that closet and I kind of backed up

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,520
 and I just, I smelled something that was off.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,880
 And so I kind of start sniffing around,

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,240
 trying to figure out what it is.

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,640
 And I opened the closet and I'm, oh, what is going on

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,960
 in there, okay?

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,960
 I'm thinking, man, maybe we left something in a suitcase

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,400
 and I'm kind of moving the suitcases around

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,680
 and I pull everything out of the closet

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,520
 so there's just this small square of carpet

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,200
 and I'm kind of sniffing around and I still smell it

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
 and I kind of sniff the carpet and it's stronger

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,160
 as I get closer to the ground.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,920
 And I'm assuming, okay, at this point,

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,560
 that it's a dead animal under the house,

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,560
 specifically a dead rat because that was a problem

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,520
 we were having around this time where there were some rats

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,680
 having a party in our attic and so I thought

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,820
 maybe that's what had happened.

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,360
 And so I start bringing some friends in.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,040
 This is what you do when something's confusing.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,600
 You bring community into this and I'm like,

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,880
 hey, come over and smell this.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,720
 And he's like, what?

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,440
 No, man, I'm serious, come on.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,960
 So community starts coming through there

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,480
 and taking, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, I know what that is.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920
 And next guy, yeah, I know what that is.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,760
 I'm like, what is it?

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,640
 He's like, it's gas.

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,080
 You've got a gas leak.

40
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
 And so I learn lots about gas.

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,800
 If you don't know, they put a scent in there.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,560
 Gas has no scent but so that you can smell it

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
 when you have a leak, they add a scent to it.

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,680
 And I'm like, well, what do I need to do?

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,240
 They're like, you need to call a plumber.

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,360
 And so I call a plumber.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,760
 Plumber comes out there, sure enough,

48
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,960
 yeah, you've got a gas leak.

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,560
 And so this plumber, he goes under the house

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,840
 where this closet is and he's like,

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,920
 I think I've fixed it there.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
 And then they test the pipes and they fill it with air

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
 and kind of pressurize it.

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,240
 He's like, no, you have several more leaks.

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,760
 I'm like, well, what do we need to do?

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,920
 And he's like, we need to find the source

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
 of each of these leaks.

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,280
 And I'm like, are you sure?

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,040
 And he's like, yes.

60
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,280
 And I'm like, well, what does that mean for me?

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,240
 And he's like, it means you're going to pay a lot of money.

62
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 I'm like, is there any other options?

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 And so I start talking about it with community

64
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,720
 and I'm in community with some smart guys

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,320
 and sit down, I'm like, hey, does anybody know

66
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,560
 anything about gas leaks?

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
 You know, what's the rate, like,

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
 what if I don't fix this?

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,560
 How about I just like, you know,

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,520
 we've been living with a gas leak, evidently, okay?

71
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
 And so is this really so bad?

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,240
 And so one of the guys, he's an engineer, okay?

73
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,280
 He's real smart and he's like, yeah,

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,320
 I know a little bit about gas leaks.

75
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
 I'm like, well, tell me about it.

76
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,560
 And he goes, well, here's what's going to happen.

77
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
 He goes, most likely, this leak is contained

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,760
 in some small space.

79
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,160
 Usually a wall or under your house.

80
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,680
 And what's happening is that's filling up

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,840
 with natural gas, which is explosive.

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,240
 And so essentially, your wall is becoming a bomb, okay?

83
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,520
 But that's not the worst of it.

84
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
 What's going to happen is as that gas fills up

85
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,440
 in that wall, it's going to seep over

86
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,360
 and then it's going to fill the room up.

87
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,980
 And you won't know it or see it because it's clear.

88
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,720
 And then one day you're going to walk in there

89
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,520
 and you're going to turn on the light switch

90
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,620
 and the filament in the light, as it heats up,

91
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,800
 is going to be the igniter and your entire house

92
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,460
 is going to blow up.

93
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,720
 And so I say, does anybody else here know about gas?

94
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,440
 (audience laughing)

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,640
 I don't like that answer.

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
 And so I go back to the plumber.

97
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,360
 I'm like, you got to find the source, right?

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,800
 The smell, the smell that I, the scent that I smelled,

99
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
 that was just a symptom, okay?

100
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,440
 That wasn't the problem.

101
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,440
 The awful smell wasn't the problem.

102
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,320
 There was a source to this problem.

103
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,160
 And so the plumber's like, hey, to resolve it,

104
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,160
 I've got to find all of the sources of these leaks.

105
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,320
 I've got to find out where the leaks are

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,640
 because if not, something, your whole house might come down.

107
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,560
 And so that's what we spent the next few days doing.

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,840
 And I tell you that because as we wrap up this series,

109
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,960
 Quarter Life Crisis, tonight we're talking

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,720
 about the crisis of anxiety.

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,280
 Now, anxiety is never the problem in and of itself.

112
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,880
 Anxiety is the smell.

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,040
 Anxiety is the scent.

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,920
 The problem is a source that to cure your anxiety,

115
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,040
 you've got to find where the leak is.

116
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,560
 There is a slow leak in your life.

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
 There is something, there is a source

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
 that you have to identify and repair

119
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,520
 in order to solve the anxiety,

120
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,560
 in order to solve the worries,

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
 in order to solve the stress.

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,680
 You must find the source.

123
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
 And so that's what I hope to do this evening

124
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
 as we move through this series.

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,680
 We're wrapping it up.

126
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
 We've covered several things.

127
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,920
 We've covered work, the crisis of work.

128
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
 We've covered the crisis of money.

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,020
 We've covered the crisis of selfie or narcissism.

130
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,080
 We've covered the crisis of singleness,

131
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,320
 the crisis of authority, the crisis of conflict.

132
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,960
 And what all of these things create in our life

133
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,840
 is a crisis of anxiety,

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,760
 a crisis of worries,

135
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,200
 which we've done messages on worry before,

136
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,280
 and we have learned that this is a huge epidemic

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
 in the audience this evening,

138
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,120
 that so many of you, your lives,

139
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,840
 you are given to anxiety in many sleepless nights.

140
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,400
 And just like this gas leak,

141
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,560
 I can cover it up, okay?

142
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,100
 I can cover up the smell.

143
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,400
 I can spray Febreze all over the house

144
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,600
 and try to pretend like everything's okay.

145
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,840
 I can ignore it.

146
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,880
 I can just kind of learn to live with the smell.

147
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,740
 I can get used to it and pretend like it's not there.

148
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,960
 But eventually, there's going to be

149
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,680
 a catastrophe, an explosion, if you will,

150
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,680
 if I do not identify the source and repair the leak.

151
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,400
 And so tonight, I hope to help you

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,900
 as we move through the scriptures,

153
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,880
 identify the source of your anxiety,

154
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
 the source of your worries.

155
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,560
 And I'll start with just some statistics for our generation.

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,000
 These come from USA Today

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,480
 and the American Psychological Association,

158
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
 which says that America is by far

159
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,800
 the most anxious nation in the world.

160
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,920
 We have an epidemic of anxiety going on around us.

161
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
 And it says this,

162
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,400
 one third of Americans will have an anxiety disorder

163
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,640
 within their lifetime.

164
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
 That's over 40 million people in America right now

165
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
 have an anxiety disorder,

166
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,080
 over 50% of which occur between, listen,

167
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,780
 the ages of 17 and 34.

168
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,020
 Well, that's exactly the demographic

169
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,220
 that is hanging out right here.

170
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,580
 Most of us, or its effects,

171
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,700
 mostly our generation, our demographic.

172
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,980
 The highest levels of anxiety are in the generation

173
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,620
 born between 1980 and 2000.

174
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,060
 The American Psychological Association says,

175
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,820
 millennials' rate of anxiety

176
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,000
 are significantly above the national average.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,140
 52% of us admit to having lain awake

178
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,700
 in the past months due to stress and anxiety.

179
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,140
 Here's what this means is,

180
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,300
 I could draw a line right here,

181
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,460
 you guys didn't sleep last night.

182
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,560
 Okay, like all of you in the past month

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,740
 have lied awake in bed with some stress keeping you up.

184
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,020
 76% admit to experiencing significant anxieties

185
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,560
 due to job, future, and economy.

186
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,040
 Okay, so what is anxiety?

187
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,440
 Let's define it before we dive into the scripture

188
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,240
 so you clearly know what you're talking about.

189
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,200
 Rollo May, who is an existential psychologist,

190
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,440
 I would tell you what that means if I knew it,

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,280
 but it's just a big word, adjective, before psychologist,

192
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,080
 and so some kind of special psychologist, this guy.

193
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
 He died in 1994, and he's kind of known

194
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
 as a guy who has separated fear into two categories.

195
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,380
 Okay, the first one is a good kind of fear,

196
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,820
 the second one is a bad kind of fear.

197
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,840
 The good kind of fear is a reactionary fear.

198
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,040
 It is a very specific fear.

199
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,760
 What it does is it kind of stirs up in us some adrenaline

200
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,880
 so that we react and respond appropriately

201
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
 to a situation when we are threatened, okay?

202
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,080
 It kicks in our, another big word, autonomic nervous system

203
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,400
 so that we can respond, and it mobilizes us to safety.

204
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,240
 Let me explain.

205
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,620
 I'm in the backyard this week, or this weekend, actually,

206
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,200
 and I'm working back there, and Weston is back there with me

207
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,100
 and I'm kind of sanding something, sanding a wooden ladder,

208
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,740
 and I'm not paying much attention to him,

209
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,980
 and all of a sudden, I look around and I don't see him.

210
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,280
 I'm in the backyard, and so then I run around the corner

211
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,300
 and I see the gate to the front yard,

212
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,780
 which leads to the street, is wide open,

213
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,160
 swinging open on its hinges, okay?

214
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,840
 This stirs up in me this first kind of fear,

215
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,480
 this reactionary fear.

216
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,060
 Somehow, I morph from the backyard to the front yard,

217
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,220
 like Raiden, okay, on Mortal Kombat.

218
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,360
 I'm just in the front yard, scanning the streets,

219
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,400
 yelling, "Weston!

220
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,360
 "Weston, Weston, I'm ready!"

221
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,540
 You know, I'm just, and the neighbors are outside.

222
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,940
 They're looking at me like I'm crazy,

223
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,640
 and then I turn around and he's on the swing set

224
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,480
 in the backyard.

225
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,920
 He was fine.

226
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
 I just looked crazy.

227
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,140
 But that is the first kind of fear, believe it or not.

228
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,300
 That is a good kind of fear.

229
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,480
 Now let's talk about the second kind of fear,

230
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,760
 otherwise known as anxiety.

231
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,240
 Rolomé labels this kind of fear worry, stress, or anxiety.

232
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,920
 This is not the good kind.

233
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,260
 This is the kind we're talking about tonight.

234
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,760
 This kind of fear, it is difficult to find the source.

235
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,600
 It's very difficult to know what actually causes this.

236
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,880
 Often, it's multi-layered, and what you think causes it

237
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
 is not actually the cause.

238
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,180
 It's something underneath that,

239
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,280
 and then something underneath that,

240
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,620
 and then something underneath that.

241
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,220
 This kind of fear distracts from productivity,

242
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,560
 while the other one actually makes us productive.

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,440
 This one holds us in kind of this apathetic,

244
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,080
 don't know what to do, worried state

245
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,280
 where we actually do nothing but worry,

246
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,840
 and it is very difficult to transition from.

247
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,560
 The other one, when I react to it

248
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
 and I see that the problem is solved,

249
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,040
 Weston's fine, I'm fine.

250
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,640
 I calm down quickly and I move on,

251
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
 and now it's a story we can laugh about.

252
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,960
 This second kind of fear, the bad kind of fear,

253
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,240
 holds you hostage.

254
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,940
 He doesn't let you go, and he just says,

255
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,740
 "Worry about me, worry about me, worry about me,

256
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,440
 "worry about me, okay, you wanna try to move on

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,580
 "to something else, hey, come back.

258
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,180
 "Come back and worry about me."

259
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,280
 Like some of you, you're getting anxious just hearing that.

260
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,100
 The second kind of fear, this anxious kind of fear,

261
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,900
 and it keeps our autonomic nervous system in gear.

262
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,700
 You can't calm down, and so your body

263
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,860
 is just running on this high adrenaline,

264
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,100
 and it causes fatigue, high blood pressure, stomach ulcers,

265
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,260
 and if you do not find the source, it can even cause death.

266
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,340
 Stressed yet?

267
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,060
 Let's move on.

268
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,460
 Tonight, we're gonna talk about two reasons not to worry,

269
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,200
 and then from the Scriptures, Matthew 6.

270
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,800
 First book in the New Testament, chapter six.

271
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,420
 We're gonna talk about how Jesus helps us wage war

272
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,700
 on our worries, and I hope to give you some solutions

273
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,140
 from the Scriptures.

274
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,620
 Matthew 6, it's a sermon outside.

275
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,780
 Jesus is in a natural amphitheater.

276
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,540
 The Pharisees are there, the sinners,

277
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,000
 the tax collectors are there, people are gathering.

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,820
 Jesus gives the most famous sermon of all time.

279
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,400
 People are listening, he's outside,

280
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,460
 he's probably sitting down, his disciples

281
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,060
 are probably near him, he's speaking

282
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,280
 in a natural speaking voice, and because of the shape

283
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,940
 of the earth in this place, which we've identified today,

284
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,840
 sound travels, okay, so you could hear him

285
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,660
 about a football field away, and people are listening

286
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,820
 as he talks about and instructs on the kingdom of heaven,

287
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,020
 who the kingdom is for, reserved for,

288
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,500
 what happens in the kingdom of heaven,

289
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,620
 who God is, talks about God's character,

290
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,660
 and what it looks like to live as a part

291
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,460
 of the kingdom of heaven, and Jesus says this

292
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,700
 in Matthew chapter six, verse 25.

293
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,860
 "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life,

294
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,500
 "what you will eat or drink, or about your body,

295
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,260
 "what you will wear.

296
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,660
 "It is not life more than food,

297
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,260
 "and the body more than clothes."

298
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,940
 Okay, what Jesus is doing is he's attacking their idols.

299
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,700
 See, in the first century church,

300
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,900
 the source of so many of their worries

301
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,480
 was actually food and clothing,

302
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,380
 the very basic necessities, and Jesus is going after these.

303
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,860
 "Look at the birds of the air, they do not sow or reap

304
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,380
 "or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father

305
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,700
 "feeds them, are you not much more valuable than they?"

306
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
 He asks, he's outside, some birds fly by,

307
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,900
 he's literally, this is a metaphor, teaching,

308
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,180
 "Look, look, you see the birds?

309
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,260
 "Does God not provide for them?

310
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,300
 "Does your heavenly Father not give them what they need?"

311
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,420
 They have a daily faith, they don't plan,

312
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,260
 they don't have like some provision of food stored up,

313
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,100
 or money in banks, they wake up today,

314
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,780
 they live for the day, they go to sleep,

315
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,020
 they wake up the next day, and they find food for that day.

316
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,620
 They don't put it anywhere, they have what they need

317
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,200
 in the day, it's a daily faith.

318
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,000
 Can you, can any one of you, by worrying

319
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,960
 at a single hour to your life,

320
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,140
 a question I want to spend some time on,

321
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,340
 and why do you worry about clothes,

322
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,940
 see how the flowers of the field grow,

323
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,860
 look at them, look at them, they do not labor or spin,

324
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,540
 yet I tell you, not even Solomon,

325
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,500
 if they came, they would have known King Solomon,

326
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
 the wealthiest man who has ever lived,

327
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,740
 and all of his splendor was,

328
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,980
 he wasn't even dressed like one of these,

329
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,100
 and if that is how God clothes the grass of the field

330
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,020
 which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire,

331
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,900
 will he not much more clothe you,

332
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,380
 and in this attack, this seems like,

333
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,140
 from Jesus, you, of little faith.

334
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:35,460
 So my first point from the scripture is simply this,

335
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,280
 that worrying is a waste of life.

336
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,540
 Worrying is a waste of life, not just a waste of time,

337
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,860
 it's not just that time passes by,

338
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,380
 it's that time passes by

339
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,740
 in the most negative type of experience.

340
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,380
 You're not doing anything productive,

341
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,580
 your time is passed by, your life is moving forward,

342
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,540
 and you are stuck doing something unproductive and negative

343
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,100
 that has a negative effect on you,

344
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,300
 it literally costs you life.

345
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,220
 You ever seen someone given to worry?

346
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,740
 Right, you ever seen their hair begins to turn gray

347
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,180
 or fall out and their eyes droop

348
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,340
 and they age, it ages you prematurely,

349
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,320
 it costs you life.

350
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,860
 And Jesus who came in John 10, 10 says,

351
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,340
 so that you might have life and have it to the fullest,

352
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,060
 who loves you says, I don't want that for you,

353
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,900
 I want something better for you,

354
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,220
 I have something better for you,

355
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,140
 and so he commands us not to do it.

356
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,620
 That's what I want you to realize from this text

357
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,380
 that do not worry is a command from the scriptures.

358
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,300
 Verse 25, I tell you do not worry about your life.

359
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,060
 Verse 31, so do not worry,

360
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,900
 and then verse 34, therefore do not worry.

361
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,980
 This is like do not get drunk, okay,

362
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,820
 do not have sex until you're married,

363
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,180
 don't kill, don't steal, don't worry.

364
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,340
 It is a command potentially clearer than some of those are.

365
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,980
 In the scripture, do not worry.

366
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,380
 And what that means, it being a command form,

367
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,540
 is that to do so is a sin.

368
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,940
 And I don't say that to rid you with guilt,

369
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,780
 okay, we know that Jesus died for our sins,

370
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,020
 what is necessary to get into heaven

371
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,180
 is that you have to be a sinner,

372
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,940
 you have to need a savior,

373
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,100
 you have to have a savior in Christ.

374
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,820
 So it's, I know that you are sinners,

375
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,980
 I know that that's what we all have in common here today

376
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,860
 is that we're sinners and some of us have in common Christ,

377
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,980
 that we've been saved by him.

378
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,940
 But this idea of worry is a sin,

379
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,700
 and it's important for us to understand that

380
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,980
 so that we can treat it like a sin.

381
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,260
 Not so that you can feel condemned,

382
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,220
 but so that you can confess it consistently.

383
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
 You gather in community, this guy says,

384
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,500
 well I looked at porn this week,

385
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,340
 and then you go and you pray for him

386
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,380
 and you talk about a plan and then you go

387
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,900
 and you say, you know what, this week I was given to worry.

388
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
 I was overwhelmed by anxiety,

389
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,220
 would you guys please pray for me

390
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,420
 and can we talk about a plan so that I can move forward.

391
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,020
 Can you guys help me find the source of this anxiety

392
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,500
 so that I can trust God there.

393
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,380
 You would treat it like a sin, you would confess it,

394
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,100
 you would pray for it regular,

395
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,100
 this is what we should do with this command, do not worry.

396
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,820
 And so some judgmental Christians

397
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,900
 can so easily see the sins of the world,

398
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,700
 the sins like drunkenness or premarital sex

399
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,780
 or pornography or whatever that is,

400
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,860
 and we overlook our own worry.

401
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,620
 We don't trust the God that we say we believe in.

402
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,140
 Right?

403
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,820
 Paul says it like this.

404
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,340
 Do not be anxious, do not worry,

405
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,060
 do not be anxious about anything,

406
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,940
 be anxious for nothing, do not worry about anything,

407
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,460
 but in every situation by prayer and petition

408
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,740
 with thanksgiving, present your request to God.

409
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,620
 He goes on to say in the peace of God,

410
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,980
 which transcends all understanding,

411
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,680
 will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

412
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,980
 Paul says do not worry about,

413
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,100
 Paul what can I worry about God,

414
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,460
 what can I worry about, not anything.

415
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,060
 Don't worry about anything.

416
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,140
 But I worry about school right?

417
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,900
 No, not anything.

418
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,140
 I can worry about my relationship right,

419
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,980
 no not anything.

420
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,340
 About my status?

421
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,180
 No, not even.

422
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,580
 About my job, I can worry about that, no.

423
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,500
 What about my bank account, rent?

424
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,380
 No, nothing.

425
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,500
 Don't worry about anything he says.

426
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,880
 It is impractical, but very, very clear.

427
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,900
 And so as we talk so much here about changing the world,

428
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,300
 I believe God through you wants to change the world

429
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,740
 and redeem this place.

430
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,860
 I don't want you to worry,

431
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,940
 I don't want you to waste your life

432
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,860
 worrying, spinning in unproductive activity.

433
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,700
 I want you to be mobilized for the sake of the gospel,

434
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,440
 giving your life to it,

435
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,380
 so that God through you would redeem this broken world

436
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,420
 that we live in, so that as he comes here to restore it,

437
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,040
 you would have began his work.

438
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,060
 You would begin his work,

439
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,680
 not focused on the worries of tomorrow,

440
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,220
 the stresses of this life,

441
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,860
 the anxieties of this place.

442
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,780
 Last week I typed an email,

443
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,600
 there was an email to the elders here,

444
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,820
 who are essentially my boss's boss,

445
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,660
 and I don't know if you've ever sent an email

446
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,460
 to people who you view as important,

447
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,100
 like I view these guys as important.

448
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,260
 Now let me disclaim this a little bit,

449
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,980
 the elders here are great men.

450
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,560
 They are gracious men, compassionate men,

451
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,860
 incredible leaders, they love Jesus.

452
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,500
 But I have a problem,

453
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,020
 and that problem is I tend to put men like that

454
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,740
 on a pedestal, and I tend to need their approval,

455
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,960
 and whenever I type an email to a boss or a boss's boss,

456
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,600
 it's like I go back to the sixth grade,

457
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,860
 and I'm getting picked for dodgeball,

458
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,820
 or not getting picked in my case, right?

459
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
 And so it's just like all of these insecurities.

460
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,100
 So I typed this email last week, I sit on it for a week,

461
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,580
 I read it like 16 times, I forwarded it to others,

462
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,220
 hey will you read this for just approval,

463
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,060
 will you proofread this,

464
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,980
 we'll make sure there's no mistakes in here.

465
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,700
 It's important.

466
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,340
 And then I sit there, and I have my finger

467
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,220
 over the send button, and a lot of you are wondering

468
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,060
 what did the email say?

469
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,100
 It was like nothing of importance.

470
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,500
 Absolutely nothing of importance.

471
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,420
 Completely underwhelming content.

472
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,260
 And I hit send, and I try to go on about my day,

473
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,260
 and I think back about that email.

474
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,340
 And then you won't believe it, I go back in the sent items,

475
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,180
 I open it up, I read it again.

476
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,780
 And then I see a left out word in the first paragraph,

477
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,980
 I'm just like oh, I can't believe it.

478
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,020
 They're gonna fire me, I left out a word.

479
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,340
 Right, which is ridiculous.

480
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,780
 And I'm sitting there, and I'm had this anxiety,

481
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,260
 and then Todd, senior pastor here, responds,

482
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,940
 and just says hey great email,

483
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,460
 thank you so much for sending that.

484
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,980
 And then what happens, all those worries just dissipate.

485
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,860
 Why?

486
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,420
 What's the source of my anxiety?

487
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,620
 Need for approval, man.

488
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,620
 I need you to like me.

489
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,100
 I need you to like me.

490
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,420
 You can become a God to me.

491
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,380
 It's gross.

492
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:13,180
 And I'm so, I just, I need your approval.

493
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,380
 Fear of man.

494
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,620
 I'd say I know none of you have probably ever done that,

495
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,380
 you probably just hit send and don't think twice,

496
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,100
 but for me that was a source of anxiety in my life.

497
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,940
 Was it productive?

498
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,220
 Absolutely not.

499
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,540
 It was unbelievably unproductive.

500
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,180
 The worry, the anxiety, that was the smell.

501
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,980
 What was the source of that smell?

502
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,140
 A fear of man, a need for approval.

503
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,780
 There was a leak in my life.

504
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,580
 And it was a complete waste of time.

505
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,980
 What else, let's dive in the scriptures.

506
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,820
 Verse 30.

507
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,460
 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field

508
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,660
 which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire,

509
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,380
 will he not much more clothe you, you of little faith?

510
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,620
 So do not worry, saying, what shall we eat

511
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,220
 or what shall we drink or what shall we wear?

512
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,620
 For the pagans run after all these things

513
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,540
 and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

514
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,340
 Pagans is a word for unbelievers, that's what that means.

515
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,580
 Those who don't know God, those who don't trust God.

516
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,940
 And so it says in there, in the scripture,

517
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,180
 it says for the pagans run after these things.

518
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,700
 Pagans are concerned with what they're gonna eat

519
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,980
 and what they're going to wear.

520
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,940
 Very difficult to understand this passage in the Greek.

521
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,260
 It's really important that we translate this

522
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,100
 so that we can bring it down because certainly

523
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,700
 it's not saying what it looks like it's saying.

524
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,980
 And so what it means, what it's actually saying,

525
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,140
 be ready for this, you write it down, it's profound.

526
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,140
 It means pagans run after these things.

527
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,940
 That these things are for pagans.

528
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,140
 Pagans are the ones who are concerned

529
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,580
 about what they're going to eat.

530
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,140
 Nonbelievers, those who don't know God,

531
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
 they're the ones that are constantly thinking

532
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,860
 about what am I gonna wear?

533
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,220
 Will I have enough money?

534
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,140
 Where am I gonna live?

535
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,220
 What about this, what about that?

536
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,260
 Let me think about tomorrow.

537
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,500
 Where am I gonna eat, what am I gonna eat?

538
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,380
 What if I don't have enough money to eat?

539
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,380
 He says nonbelievers are concerned with these things.

540
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,580
 Those that don't have a God to trust in.

541
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,340
 And so my second point this evening

542
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,420
 is that worrying is worldly worship.

543
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,420
 Worrying is worldly worship.

544
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,340
 See food and clothing, as I said earlier,

545
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,300
 we're their idols.

546
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,380
 And who worship idols?

547
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,420
 Pagans worship idols.

548
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,260
 Those who do not know the one true God,

549
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,540
 they're the ones that worship idols.

550
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:41,240
 You show me your worries and I'll show you your idols.

551
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,500
 You show me what you're worried about

552
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,260
 and I will show you your idols.

553
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,060
 So often the source of our smell,

554
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
 the source of our leak,

555
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,300
 is that something in our lives has become too important.

556
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,220
 Something, in my case, the elders, my boss, Todd,

557
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,500
 something has become too important.

558
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,940
 So what is the source of your worries?

559
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,580
 Food and clothing were theirs, what are ours?

560
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,900
 Is it career advancement or fear of being overlooked

561
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,740
 or fear of staying single or fear of missing out

562
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,460
 or fear of not advancing in your career

563
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,380
 or fear of losing your job?

564
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,780
 See so often the source of our worries are just worldliness.

565
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,660
 It's just like we're stuck in this temporary world

566
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,220
 and we begin to worship the things in this world.

567
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,660
 They become ultimate in our lives.

568
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,180
 They replace God as ultimate.

569
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,540
 And then all of a sudden if one of those is compromised

570
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,580
 or if we even think about the idea

571
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,980
 of one of those being compromised,

572
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,460
 our world comes crumbling down.

573
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,500
 Tim Keller says that worry is being fearful

574
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,300
 that God will get it wrong

575
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,580
 and bitterness is believing he did.

576
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,460
 And I just think he nailed it.

577
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,420
 Worrying is being fearful that God will get it wrong.

578
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,340
 Has God ever gotten it wrong?

579
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,900
 He's never gotten it wrong, the God that we worship.

580
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,900
 And we worry because we think that God

581
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,020
 will not give us what we need

582
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,620
 or we fear that his desires are different than ours,

583
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,460
 that what we desire and what he desires,

584
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,100
 those won't be the same thing.

585
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,740
 But I wanna ask you a question.

586
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,500
 Have you ever chased your worries down?

587
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,380
 As you try to find where that leak is,

588
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,660
 you just kinda keep in your mind chasing what is it?

589
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,380
 You keep peeling that onion.

590
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,660
 You keep peeling back the layers.

591
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,500
 What is it behind that?

592
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,580
 Well, what is it behind that?

593
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,180
 There's a really powerful question a friend asked me once

594
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,460
 and it was the question what if?

595
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,900
 What if, it was such a powerful question.

596
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,300
 I came to him, this was before I worked for the church,

597
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,620
 I was in sales, I was really discouraged.

598
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,940
 I was a Christian, I was being discipled at this time

599
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,620
 and the gentleman who was discipling me,

600
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,340
 who was teaching me the Bible sat down

601
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,300
 and he just saw the look of stress and anxiety on my face.

602
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,780
 Is everything all right?

603
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,700
 No, it's not.

604
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,540
 What's wrong?

605
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,620
 I was like, man, I just, I'm not, you know,

606
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,380
 I gotta get in front of more customers.

607
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,220
 I was in sales.

608
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,700
 I gotta get in front of more customers.

609
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,140
 He says, well, what if you don't?

610
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,700
 Well, if I don't, duh, I'm not gonna make quota.

611
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,140
 I said, okay, what if you don't make quota?

612
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,540
 Well, if I don't make quota, I'm gonna be put on a plan.

613
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,220
 Okay, what if you put on a plan?

614
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,140
 Well, if I don't make quota again, if I put on a plan,

615
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,780
 I may not make quota the next month.

616
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,260
 Well, what if you don't make quota the next month?

617
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,220
 If I don't make quota two months in a row,

618
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,180
 I'm gonna get fired.

619
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,680
 I said, what if you get fired?

620
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,300
 Well, if I get fired, I'm not gonna have any money.

621
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,420
 Well, what if you don't have any money?

622
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,260
 Well, if I don't have any money,

623
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,340
 I'm not gonna get a date.

624
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,460
 What if you don't get a date?

625
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,260
 If I don't get a date, I'm not gonna get married.

626
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,420
 And if I don't get married, I'm gonna have lots of cats,

627
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,220
 and I don't even like cats.

628
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,820
 Okay, why are we playing this what if game?

629
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,660
 And we kept chasing and chasing and chasing,

630
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,340
 trying to figure out what it was,

631
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,860
 which in my situation was security,

632
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,340
 was a need for comfort and security.

633
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,780
 I didn't wanna worry, I didn't wanna have to rely on God.

634
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,700
 Like he says in here, a daily faith.

635
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,260
 I don't want a daily, God, don't make me trust you.

636
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,260
 Can you give me so much so that I don't have to trust you?

637
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,100
 How about we do that?

638
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,300
 How about that's how this works.

639
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,580
 I'll worship you, I'll learn this book,

640
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,820
 and you give me so much that I never need to trust you.

641
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,660
 How about that deal?

642
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,900
 Can we do that?

643
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,600
 I don't want a daily faith like the birds.

644
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,280
 Man, what if I starve in America?

645
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:47,940
 (audience laughing)

646
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,660
 Get up there and see Jesus, and like,

647
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,420
 hey Jesus, I starved.

648
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,700
 That's right.

649
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,540
 You said I wouldn't, and I did.

650
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,460
 I said, welcome to my kingdom.

651
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,800
 Okay, non-issue.

652
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,660
 No problem.

653
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,260
 Starved.

654
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,340
 Does anyone read this and think, yeah, yeah, yeah,

655
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,440
 but birds starve.

656
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,180
 I mean, birds die, like wait a minute.

657
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,340
 Somewhere, someplace, some birds gotta starve to death.

658
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,180
 He says if he cares for the birds,

659
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,300
 will he not care for you?

660
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,120
 And I'm like, wait a minute,

661
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,140
 does he always care for the birds?

662
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,060
 Let's talk about that for a second.

663
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,060
 Jesus goes to great lengths to show you in Matthew 10,

664
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,400
 same book, different chapter.

665
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
 He says this, Matthew 10, verse 29.

666
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,500
 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny,

667
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,700
 yet not one of them will fall to the ground

668
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
 outside your father's care?

669
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,540
 Wow.

670
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,860
 That a sparrow is worth half a cent,

671
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,100
 you're worth much more than them,

672
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,020
 the scripture says, twice.

673
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,300
 And he says not even a sparrow falls to the ground

674
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,260
 outside of the Lord's will, outside of his care.

675
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,920
 That's what it says.

676
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,300
 And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered,

677
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,100
 so don't be afraid, you're worth more than many sparrows.

678
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,700
 He goes to great lengths to show you

679
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,780
 that God is in control.

680
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,180
 And so our right response to his control

681
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,760
 is to look to what he's doing and trust him.

682
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,660
 Let me show you from the scriptures, verse 33.

683
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,460
 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness

684
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,460
 and all these things will be given to you as well.

685
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,180
 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,

686
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,380
 for tomorrow will worry about itself.

687
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,640
 Each day has enough trouble of its own.

688
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,300
 And so now let's talk about waging war with worries.

689
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,100
 How do we now wage war with worries?

690
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,780
 From this text, it says that we seek first his kingdom.

691
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,620
 What does this mean?

692
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,020
 It means, number one, remember what God is doing.

693
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,780
 God, it's a very powerful question

694
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,500
 and if your first knee-jerking worry is this question,

695
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,580
 ready, God, what are you up to?

696
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
 God, what are you doing?

697
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,180
 God, I know you're doing something,

698
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,260
 you're always doing something.

699
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,980
 For the eyes of the Lord go to and fro

700
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,020
 throughout the earth, looking for hearts

701
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,580
 that are fully his, the scripture says.

702
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,780
 God, what is it that you're doing?

703
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,820
 And what is he doing?

704
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,300
 I mean, I've read the script, I read how it ends, right?

705
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,940
 It ends, you know, Satan zero, Jesus infinity,

706
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,620
 a new heaven, new earth,

707
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,300
 we get to be in God's kingdom forever

708
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,740
 if you've trusted in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins.

709
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,780
 You get to live forever with God.

710
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,700
 That's what he's doing and so you're just somewhere

711
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,900
 in this kind of middle, weird process of that

712
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,740
 and he is bringing that forward

713
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,700
 and so in the midst of your worries, right,

714
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,820
 you know, you're like, well, what if?

715
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,700
 Well, I might be single forever.

716
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,380
 Well, until I die and then I get up to heaven

717
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,040
 and I'm married to Jesus, which is weird if you're a dude,

718
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,040
 but true, but true, but true,

719
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,620
 you get to be the bride of God.

720
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,140
 Well, nobody gets up to heaven and is like,

721
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,200
 man, God, I can't believe you made me single

722
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,100
 for those 80 years.

723
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,740
 I mean, I don't even think anyone even comprehends

724
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,380
 that up there, you get up there and you're like,

725
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,500
 hey, all this is yours, you're the heir to the kingdom.

726
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,900
 Okay, where do I start?

727
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,740
 Start with worshiping you for a couple hundred thousand

728
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,740
 years, I mean, this is the reality that we live in, right?

729
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,560
 What, God, what are you doing?

730
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,920
 Remember that God is doing something.

731
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,360
 Seek first his kingdom and then seek first his righteousness.

732
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,200
 What does that mean?

733
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,060
 Remember that God is good.

734
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,300
 Secondly, we remember that God is good.

735
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,440
 Your worries are not bad if you respond

736
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,300
 to them appropriately.

737
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,420
 How do you respond to them appropriately?

738
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,700
 They are your greatest opportunity to trust God.

739
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,380
 The things that cause you anxiety are your greatest

740
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,900
 opportunities to trust the God that you say you believe in.

741
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:02,180
 God, I want to respond appropriately, I want to trust you.

742
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:06,220
 And every worry that comes to your mind is just a whisper.

743
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,260
 You know what the whisper says?

744
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,860
 It's this, you can't trust God.

745
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,780
 Hey, you can't trust God, he's not good.

746
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,380
 God's not good.

747
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,700
 He doesn't care about you.

748
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,060
 He's not good.

749
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,420
 There's a worry he's not good.

750
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,060
 There's a worry he's not good.

751
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,420
 There's a worry you can't trust him.

752
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,940
 There's a worry he's not good.

753
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,940
 There's a worry he's forgotten you.

754
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,260
 He's forgotten you.

755
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,460
 He doesn't care about you.

756
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,700
 Are any of these things true?

757
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,980
 These are the things your worries whisper.

758
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,500
 God is not good, you cannot trust him.

759
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,660
 He has forgotten you.

760
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,860
 And so we battle worry with worship

761
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,940
 and we battle fear with faith.

762
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,780
 We battle worry with worship and we battle fear with faith.

763
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,380
 It says this in 2 Corinthians 10 five,

764
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,620
 it's a very powerful, very powerful verse.

765
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
 It says this, we demolish arguments

766
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,220
 in every pretension that set itself up

767
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,940
 against the knowledge of God.

768
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,740
 And we take captive, take captive.

769
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,780
 It says, it goes on to say, we take captive

770
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,940
 every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

771
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,180
 Take captive sounds so violent.

772
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,420
 It sounds like UFC, like rear naked choke,

773
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,660
 like come here, I'll take you captive.

774
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,900
 It sounds, I mean, doesn't it sound like being escorted out,

775
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,780
 like some battle, like take you captive, you know.

776
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,620
 Get in there.

777
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,060
 Lock it up, throw away the key, I took it captive.

778
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,540
 He says you take captive every argument

779
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,340
 that tries to tell you that God is not good.

780
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,180
 That God is not trustworthy, that God does not love you,

781
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,900
 that God does not have a plan.

782
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,340
 You take that thought captive and you make it obedient.

783
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,740
 You make it your slave, you make it obedient to Jesus.

784
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,300
 Oh no, he's good.

785
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,380
 He sent his son Jesus to die for me in my place.

786
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,980
 He paid for my sins, he set me free from it.

787
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,460
 He's good, he's good, you make it obedient.

788
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,700
 And I met with people who struggle with anxiety

789
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,020
 and I think so often what they do

790
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,020
 is they take those thoughts captive

791
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,020
 until they keep coming back relentlessly

792
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,460
 and then they eventually give up.

793
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,700
 Hey, you gotta take those thoughts captive.

794
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,780
 I'm trying, I'm trying.

795
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,020
 Don't try, take 'em captive.

796
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,800
 Hey, you may have to take 'em captive for 10 years,

797
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,820
 two decades maybe, but you keep taking 'em captive.

798
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,380
 You don't stop taking 'em captive.

799
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,540
 Let me illustrate.

800
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,740
 I told you we had a rat problem.

801
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,360
 Very, very frustrating, this rat problem, okay.

802
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,300
 I hired a professional, a rat buster if you will.

803
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,300
 He came over and I paid him a lot of money

804
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
 to get rid of these rats.

805
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,220
 And he tried and he failed.

806
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,540
 So I took matters into my own hands

807
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,980
 and I went to Home Depot and I spent $1.50

808
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,240
 on a little rat trap and I set it, set it,

809
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,760
 and I put peanut butter and bacon bits,

810
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,040
 that's free, in there and I got a rat.

811
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,540
 And I set it again and I got a rat.

812
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,300
 And I set it again and I got a rat.

813
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,980
 Now we're waging war, okay.

814
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,620
 I'm killing these rats, but they're like

815
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,840
 having a party up there.

816
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,500
 The guy told me there were hundreds of 'em, okay.

817
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,860
 I don't know if he was serious, but that's what he said.

818
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,700
 And so I'm up there, I'm like, hey, I will do this

819
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,540
 the rest of my life if it takes it.

820
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,140
 I will kill all these rats.

821
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,180
 And I set the trap again, got one,

822
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,300
 it was a celebration, we're here, go get 'em,

823
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,980
 dump it, set it again, let's go rats, okay.

824
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,180
 They got signs in my attic, says free rent, right there.

825
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,580
 They're having a party up there,

826
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,420
 a rat party is occurring right above my master bedroom.

827
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,540
 But I'm waging war with these rats.

828
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,400
 And eventually I set that trap and it sat there.

829
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,300
 And victory was mine.

830
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,980
 I killed every rat in Richardson, Texas.

831
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,860
 You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.

832
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,980
 They are now extinct in Richardson.

833
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,740
 And it took a lot of work and a lot of effort

834
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,700
 and being consistent, but eventually they were dead.

835
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,780
 And that's what it means, you take those thoughts captive.

836
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,820
 You do not give up taking those thoughts.

837
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,060
 They're gonna come back, it's gonna come back.

838
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,260
 I'm telling you, it's gonna come back, you take it captive.

839
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,060
 It's come back, you take it captive.

840
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,620
 I want you to replace those thoughts

841
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,020
 that you can't trust God with the good things,

842
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,580
 with the good things that he's done.

843
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,220
 Has God done some good things?

844
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,060
 Is God trustworthy?

845
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,020
 Man, God has done some amazing things, guys.

846
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,940
 The God that you worship created the heavens and the earth

847
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,980
 and everything in it.

848
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,020
 He told the land where to stop, the sky where to stop.

849
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,540
 He gave the earth its boundaries.

850
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,800
 He created humans, put them in the garden

851
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,820
 so that they might worship him and know him

852
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,980
 and walk in relationship with him.

853
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,860
 And then when evil had taken over,

854
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,740
 he creates this ark, this boat,

855
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,300
 and he puts the people that are his people on that boat,

856
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,140
 and in the midst of destruction, he preserves life.

857
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,140
 And after that, he unlocks wombs.

858
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,220
 And then his people are in slavery,

859
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,660
 he provides them a way out, a sea for them to move through

860
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,740
 so that their enemies, those that are running after them,

861
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,620
 are captured, and then he provided manna from heaven

862
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,620
 so that they might eat.

863
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,700
 He brought down the walls of Jericho.

864
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,780
 He killed giants with tiny stones.

865
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,300
 He brought water from a rock.

866
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,020
 He brought down fire from heaven.

867
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,860
 He shut the mouths of lions.

868
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,860
 He brought life through the fiery furnace.

869
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,580
 He controls the wind and the rain.

870
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,980
 He's fed thousands with little.

871
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,060
 He's healed the sick.

872
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,780
 He's made the blind see, the deaf hear, the mute speak.

873
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,580
 And he's brought the dead back to life,

874
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,220
 and he's made provision for you and me through the cross

875
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,380
 as Jesus died for your sins and rose from the grave.

876
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,460
 Can you not trust him?

877
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,620
 You're gonna trust him with your salvation,

878
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,300
 but not trust him in your day to day?

879
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,700
 You're gonna say, "God, you saved me

880
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,140
 "and reconciled me to yourself forever?"

881
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,740
 But man, I'm single.

882
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,020
 (audience laughing)

883
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,900
 And I don't know if I'm gonna have any money.

884
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,500
 Can you not trust him?

885
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,460
 He's a very, very trustworthy God.

886
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,020
 And this is why thirdly,

887
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:28,940
 we take it day by day, one day at a time.

888
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,500
 Thirdly, you take it one day at a time.

889
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,820
 He says this in the scripture.

890
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:47,500
 He says, "Who," I'll find it in just one second.

891
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,700
 He says, "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,

892
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,380
 "for tomorrow will worry about itself.

893
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,420
 "Each day has enough trouble of its own."

894
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,740
 And so you trust him.

895
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,380
 You take it one day at a time,

896
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,500
 and I want you to give your worries a 12 hour boundary.

897
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,180
 You do not let your worries venture

898
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,420
 past that 12 hour boundary.

899
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,340
 You say, "You know what?

900
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,580
 "God has me in today.

901
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,460
 "I don't even know if tomorrow will happen."

902
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,180
 You're worried about losing your job tomorrow?

903
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,540
 There may not be a company tomorrow.

904
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,700
 There might not be life tomorrow.

905
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,980
 Jesus might come back tonight while you sleep, man.

906
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,460
 You give your worries 12 hour.

907
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,900
 You say, "Hey, this is the 12 hours I'm gonna live in.

908
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,380
 "I'm not going to let my mind venture past these 12 hours

909
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,900
 "because so often our worries are future-based.

910
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,140
 "It's something out there that we're living in,

911
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,620
 "some unreality, okay?

912
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,940
 "Something that's not true,

913
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,820
 "something that's some future conversation

914
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,260
 "that we begin to have in our head,

915
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,420
 "and all of a sudden there you are,

916
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,100
 "and your boss is there, and you're all worked up."

917
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,420
 And it never even happened.

918
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,220
 It just happened up here.

919
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,580
 Take those thoughts captive

920
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,780
 and make them obedient to Christ.

921
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,220
 Don't entertain those thoughts.

922
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,060
 You make them obedient to Jesus.

923
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,500
 You be nearsighted with your worries,

924
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,220
 not farsighted with your worries.

925
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,620
 So I don't know what tomorrow holds.

926
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,740
 I've heard it said, "I don't know what tomorrow holds,

927
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,500
 "but I know who holds tomorrow."

928
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,660
 And I'm telling you, you can trust the one who holds tomorrow.

929
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,780
 This is what you have to worry about.

930
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,740
 What is right before you?

931
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,100
 What's at your feet?

932
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,620
 That's it.

933
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,700
 So in summary, worrying is a waste of life.

934
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,420
 Worrying is worldly worship.

935
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,060
 And we wage war on worries by

936
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,860
 remembering what God is doing,

937
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,740
 remembering that he is good,

938
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,100
 and taking it one day at a time.

939
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,740
 Do you know what the source of that smell is?

940
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,340
 The source of that anxiety?

941
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,700
 It's a slow leak of faith.

942
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,300
 That's all it is.

943
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,660
 It's just a slow leak of faith.

944
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,500
 It's coming out.

945
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,580
 Can't trust him.

946
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,660
 He's not good.

947
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,740
 He doesn't love you.

948
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,420
 He's forgotten you.

949
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,020
 Slow leak of faith.

950
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,740
 And it spun up this smell of anxiety in your life.

951
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,820
 I remember a very specific day.

952
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,060
 I had become a Christian.

953
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,980
 It was about six months to a year into Christianity.

954
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,420
 And when I became a Christian,

955
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,780
 I did so with much zeal as I do many things in my life.

956
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,340
 And so I found Jesus, or Jesus found me.

957
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,780
 I fell in love with him.

958
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,260
 I began to study him.

959
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,140
 I began to tell everyone I could about him.

960
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,540
 I just was really in love with the Savior.

961
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,860
 Okay, you're just like a new Christian.

962
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,540
 I would've talked to anybody about the gospel.

963
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,460
 I was fearless for the gospel.

964
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,940
 And then that began to wear off,

965
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,660
 and the real world kinda started kicking back in

966
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,420
 and began to kick me around.

967
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,860
 And then all of a sudden I realized

968
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,900
 I had to go back to this job that I didn't really like.

969
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,540
 And so that's where I was at.

970
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,020
 I was anxious.

971
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,940
 I mean, you could go down the very things

972
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,580
 that we've talked about here,

973
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,420
 and those were the things.

974
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,260
 I mean, it was work.

975
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,660
 I was anxious about work.

976
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,860
 I was anxious about money.

977
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,100
 Anxiety about work usually is anxiety about money.

978
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,240
 I thought about myself way too much.

979
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,340
 I had become an idol in myself.

980
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,620
 I was worried about my single status.

981
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,820
 I didn't know if I should be single

982
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,500
 or if I should get married or what that looked like

983
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,700
 or what the right age was and when do you know.

984
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,620
 And they keep telling me, hey, you just know when you know.

985
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,180
 And I wanted to hit 'em in the mouth.

986
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,100
 And I was worried about authority

987
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,620
 because I didn't really trust the authority

988
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,660
 that was over me.

989
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,100
 And then my life, as I looked at the relationships

990
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,980
 that I had, were marked by much conflict.

991
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,840
 So so many of the things we covered

992
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,580
 had caused such anxiety in my life now

993
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,180
 and this God that I said that I believed in

994
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,340
 and trusted in for salvation,

995
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,620
 I no longer trusted in for the day to day.

996
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,860
 And I knew I needed to get right

997
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,640
 and I knew I needed to renew my mind.

998
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,140
 And so I show up to church about 45 minutes early

999
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,140
 on a Sunday and we met in this high school at the time.

1000
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,820
 And so I get there 45 minutes.

1001
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,100
 I remember that the doors were locked.

1002
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,340
 This guy let me in.

1003
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,740
 And the only people who were there

1004
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,120
 were the ones that were kind of bringing in the equipment,

1005
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,960
 the sound equipment,

1006
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,740
 'cause we met in this high school auditorium.

1007
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,140
 And so they were bringing in stuff.

1008
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,200
 It was just the volunteers.

1009
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,300
 And instead of helping them,

1010
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,340
 I went and I sat down in the auditorium

1011
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,820
 and I just sat down there and I began to pray

1012
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,740
 and wrestle with God and just like,

1013
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,820
 oh, I was so anxious.

1014
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,220
 And I was thinking about all of these things

1015
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,300
 I just told you about.

1016
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,260
 And I opened my Bible.

1017
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,220
 And I didn't even know like the books of the Bible.

1018
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,460
 I didn't know the Bible at the time.

1019
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,980
 I was a new believer and new Christian.

1020
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,740
 And so I just kind of opened it

1021
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,300
 and it turned to this page with a bunch of red words on it.

1022
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,300
 Words of Jesus.

1023
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:30,300
 Jesus was preaching a sermon in Matthew chapter six.

1024
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,420
 And I was right here.

1025
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,260
 And I read, do not worry.

1026
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,820
 Who by worrying can add a single hour to his life?

1027
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,780
 Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness

1028
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,620
 and all these things will be added to you.

1029
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,740
 Do not worry about tomorrow

1030
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,340
 for tomorrow has enough worries of its own.

1031
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,100
 I kept reading the do not worry.

1032
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,540
 Do not worry, do not worry.

1033
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:59,380
 And in this moment, it was like my peripheral was blurred.

1034
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,660
 And as I read the words of Jesus on the page,

1035
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,380
 it was like the Holy Spirit just whispered to me

1036
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,940
 in a merciful, compassionate way.

1037
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,980
 As my head translated that to my heart,

1038
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,580
 what I heard was, I got you.

1039
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,340
 I got you.

1040
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,740
 Which has really become like a mantra in my life

1041
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,740
 when I've carried into this ministry

1042
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,500
 as we say, he's got you, he's got you.

1043
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,540
 I just heard, I mean, that was it.

1044
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,220
 In that moment, I sat there and in one of those rare times,

1045
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,780
 I just heard the voice of the Lord so clearly

1046
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,860
 and he just says, I got you.

1047
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,460
 What are you worried about?

1048
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,420
 I got you.

1049
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,980
 I got you.

1050
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,460
 That's what I want you to hear tonight.

1051
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,740
 Through this text, as we read it together,

1052
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,700
 and he says, hey guys, God provides for the birds

1053
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,540
 and for the flowers.

1054
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,060
 You fix your eyes on Jesus.

1055
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,780
 You turn your eyes on him.

1056
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,140
 You seek first his kingdom and his righteousness

1057
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,220
 and then you trust him for everything else

1058
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,340
 'cause he's got you.

1059
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,860
 He's got you.

1060
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,700
 He's got you.

1061
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,660
 Let me pray.

1062
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,420
 (pages rustling)

1063
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:26,940
 Father, as we sing this closing love song to you,

1064
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:32,580
 would you remove the distractions of the person next to us,

1065
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,460
 the person raising their hand in front of us?

1066
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,700
 Would you remove the distractions of that conversation

1067
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,980
 we had with the boss or a coworker?

1068
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,220
 Would you remove the distractions

1069
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,580
 of our dwindling banking count,

1070
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,220
 the distractions of our single status,

1071
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,340
 the distractions of our bad relationship,

1072
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,940
 the distractions of our sin yesterday,

1073
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,220
 this morning, an hour ago?

1074
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:02,100
 And Father, would you fix our eyes on Christ?

1075
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,100
 Give us only Christ as we sing this song to you.

1076
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,660
 Would you just help us to know you more through your son?

1077
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,100
 And would you just remind us in your subtle

1078
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,980
 or not so subtle ways that you love us,

1079
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,980
 that you're good, that we can trust you?

1080
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,820
 Father, I thank you for those promises.

1081
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,100
 Would you please remind my friends of that,

1082
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,420
 that we might be unleashed for your kingdom,

1083
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,060
 not distracted by our worries?

1084
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,260
 You got us.

1085
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,580
 You got us.

1086
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,020
 Said this before and I,

1087
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,020
 it's something that's ministered to me,

1088
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,980
 but just this powerful equation.

1089
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,300
 Just that there's a God who controls everything

1090
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,100
 and he loves you.

1091
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,460
 He controls everything and he loves you.

1092
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,020
 He's good.

1093
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,540
 And so if you turn that into a math equation,

1094
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,380
 it's like God controls everything,

1095
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:05,380
 plus God loves you, plus God is good, equals your peace.

1096
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,820
 What do you have to worry about?

1097
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,580
 There's a God who controls everything,

1098
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,220
 who's good and loves you.

1099
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,500
 What can you worry about?

1100
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,580
 So just return to that truth.

1101
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:20,260
 Move back to that truth.

1102
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,340
 If you don't know that truth,

1103
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:24,420
 if you're here and you've never trusted in Christ,

1104
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,500
 when I say trust in Christ,

1105
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,820
 I'm not talking about a magic prayer you did

1106
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,620
 when you were six or anything like that,

1107
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,340
 that you've never kind of went back to.

1108
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,860
 I'm talking about a literal belief

1109
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,700
 that God became a man in the form of Jesus Christ,

1110
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,420
 lived a perfect life as an example for us

1111
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,700
 and then died a perfect death,

1112
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,500
 a torturous death on a cross for our sins,

1113
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,220
 that he literally paid the price for our sins,

1114
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,500
 the wage for our sins,

1115
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,140
 the cost of our sins was satisfied on him.

1116
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,460
 He goes in the grave like every dead person would,

1117
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,940
 except for he came out defeating sin,

1118
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,300
 defeating death and offering you life eternally with God

1119
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,860
 should you trust in that.

1120
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,020
 (silence)

1121
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:19,020
