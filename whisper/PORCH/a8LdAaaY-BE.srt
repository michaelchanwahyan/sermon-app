1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,320
 - Alright, hey we're wrapping up our series,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,740
 Cupid, Dating Myths, taking one myth per week

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,840
 and just kind of addressing that from the scriptures.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,460
 Trying to see what God, the creator,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,840
 the heavens, the earth, what truths he has for us.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,340
 And there's just this reality that I think a lot of us,

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,360
 as we think through our expectations

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,680
 or just this idea of love or we look at culture,

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,500
 you know, it really throws us off.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,120
 And so we're kind of scrambling with resources

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,220
 and you get this book and like let's be honest,

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,780
 it doesn't, if this whole book,

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,140
 and you know it's a bunch of pages,

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,960
 you know everything that it has to say about marriage

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,760
 is probably less than that, okay?

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,360
 And so then you know, we kind of resort to,

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,100
 okay well where else can I learn, you know,

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,120
 Us Weekly or what, you know, Cosmo,

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,000
 where else are there truths?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,220
 And I think a lot of times we turn to, you know,

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,920
 Hollywood or the romantic comedies that are put out there

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,680
 and I just, I wish somebody would show an honest movie,

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,460
 right, say hey this is honest, like this is real,

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,400
 this is what love actually looks like.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,880
 In fact, before we go any further,

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,440
 I want you guys to watch this.

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,880
 That movie is fantasy.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,160
 And here's why it's fantasy,

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,320
 'cause I don't know if you've seen it,

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,260
 I'm gonna ruin the ending so if you care, earmuffs.

32
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,580
 But you know, essentially the lady has Alzheimer's

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,040
 and it ends in this beautiful picture of commitment.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,140
 But you don't get commitment in the way that

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,360
 traveling the path the movie takes you down, okay?

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,440
 People who travel that path don't end up in commitment,

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,300
 they end up somewhere different, that's fantasy.

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,980
 Now I think a lot of us, we're here tonight

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,060
 and the reality is I prayed through

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,380
 where the Lord would take us to tonight

41
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,660
 as we wrap up this series,

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,820
 I think a lot of us are hoping in fantasy.

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,020
 And I know fantasy, see I got two little girls,

44
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,700
 two little girls, right, and you walk into my house

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,580
 and it looks like Disney threw up in my room,

46
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,180
 like it exploded in my house, okay?

47
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,740
 Everything is Disney princess.

48
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,980
 Like I walk in and Presley who's five,

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
 she's the daddy, Finley's usually the mommy,

50
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,860
 poor baby Weston is always the baby

51
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,220
 and they're always taking care,

52
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,700
 they're always playing house,

53
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,180
 they're always dressing up like princesses,

54
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,460
 put on their little crowns,

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,580
 and I mean they have proposed to me 17 times

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,740
 and it's sweet, you know, daddy will you marry me?

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,540
 Yes baby, I'm married to mom.

58
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,740
 You know they proposed to Weston 17 times as well.

59
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,820
 And so just all of these things,

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,500
 in fact we went to the movies on Sunday

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,220
 and Finley's like, hey daddy can I wear my crown?

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,260
 I'm like sure, you know, come on princess,

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,060
 wear your crown, so she wears her crown to the movies

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,540
 and after we go to Starbucks and this lady's like,

65
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,100
 oh man, you look so beautiful,

66
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,700
 you know dressed up like a princess,

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,740
 did you go to a ball today?

68
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,060
 I'm like no, we went to the movies, you know,

69
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,100
 and so that's their world, right?

70
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,180
 And so for some of you, that's where it started.

71
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,900
 It started with Disney, Happily Ever After,

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,940
 and you've been pursuing that ever since

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,180
 and that's what your crosshairs are on,

74
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,420
 that's what you're looking for,

75
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,780
 that's where your expectations are,

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,060
 but the problem is,

77
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,220
 the problem is your greatest disappointments

78
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,660
 come from your expectations

79
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,500
 and that's why so many people,

80
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 as they consider dating and marriage and relationships,

81
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 it is riddled with disappointments,

82
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,660
 discouragement and despair

83
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,700
 and I think everybody's looking for something to hope in,

84
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,820
 but too many of us are hoping in fantasy

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,500
 and so today the myth is just this idea

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,740
 that marriage is for happiness.

87
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,660
 It's a really popular idea that you marry

88
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,180
 to be happy, that marriage is for happiness.

89
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,140
 Monica and I, I know this firsthand,

90
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,780
 because my wife and I, we pursued fantasy.

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,340
 Like we wanted the happily ever after story

92
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,580
 and I even think like for so much of our relationship,

93
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,660
 we actually enjoyed living in the soap opera,

94
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,660
 so I remember the day that she walked in,

95
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
 I was at this party in college, you know,

96
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,980
 in this tiny little apartment,

97
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,460
 'cause somehow you have big parties

98
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,780
 and tiny little apartments in college,

99
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,820
 and she walked in wearing this leopard dress

100
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,060
 and I looked up and I was just like,

101
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,340
 oh my goodness, who is that?

102
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,460
 And I was in a committed relationship

103
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,980
 and she was in a committed relationship,

104
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,900
 but that didn't stop us and we started pursuing each other

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,220
 and somehow, you know, somehow we ended up

106
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,540
 in this relationship where we kept pursuing each other

107
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,300
 and it looked like, and I'm gonna give you a glimpse

108
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,220
 into it, it looked like manic highs and manic lows.

109
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,620
 It looked like I love you, I adore you,

110
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,980
 we're star-crossed lovers, blah,

111
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,980
 and then I hate you, I never wanna see you again,

112
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,500
 get out of my face, I can't live without you,

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,580
 walk home, you know, these are the things.

114
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,420
 (congregation laughing)

115
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,740
 Some of you are like, yeah.

116
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,660
 That's, I mean, those are everything I just said

117
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,060
 or things I had said then, dozens and dozens

118
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,580
 and dozens of times.

119
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,940
 And then this incredible thing happened

120
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,980
 where we became followers of Jesus

121
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,700
 in the midst of all of that turmoil,

122
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,500
 we found someone else to love besides each other.

123
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,820
 In fact, I remember as we went through pre-marital

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,620
 counseling, sitting with this little pastor,

125
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,180
 very skeptical, and he looked at me

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,180
 and he just said, hey, I want you guys

127
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,620
 to stop pursuing each other and start pursuing God together.

128
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,300
 And I just thought, you are so stupid.

129
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,420
 Like, what does that even mean?

130
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,700
 Like, okay, we're gonna start pursuing each other,

131
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,100
 we're getting married, dude.

132
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,860
 And as I look back on the work that God has done

133
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,740
 in our relationship today, and that's exactly what happened,

134
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,380
 when it turned around, we had stopped pursuing each other

135
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,500
 and we started pursuing him together

136
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,020
 and things started straightening out,

137
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,100
 not before we got married, okay?

138
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,540
 Year one, honeymoon, year two, disaster.

139
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,100
 Disaster.

140
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,700
 And so some of us, you know, we never grow out of this

141
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,540
 pursuit of happily ever after,

142
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,460
 this pursuit of someone to love.

143
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,700
 You know, and I told you, the Bible doesn't have

144
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,620
 a lot to say about it, but what it does have to say,

145
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,420
 it says marriage is hard, it gives instructions

146
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,100
 because it's difficult, and then it says

147
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,020
 it's actually about something beyond each other.

148
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,140
 It says that marriage is actually this metaphor

149
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,180
 for us learning more about God

150
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
 as we look on what marriage looks like.

151
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,780
 That's really what the Bible has to say

152
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,340
 about marriage in a nutshell.

153
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,220
 And so I just wanna, let me recap where we've been

154
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
 in Cupid series, the first thing, week one,

155
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,580
 we talked about resetting our sights,

156
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,940
 we talked about the criteria,

157
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,860
 setting our sights on godly character,

158
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,260
 and I just said this idea, hey, you don't need

159
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,580
 a trophy wife or a husband, you need someone

160
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,980
 to go to war with, okay, marriage is hard,

161
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,940
 discipling your children, that's difficult,

162
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,860
 life's gonna throw all these curveballs at you,

163
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,460
 you don't know what's coming, you don't want

164
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
 a trophy wife or husband, you want someone

165
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,620
 you can go to war with.

166
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,700
 Week two, we talked about how we're resetting our strategy,

167
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,780
 I just said, hey, don't follow your heart,

168
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,380
 inform your heart, we looked at Proverbs 4:23,

169
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,060
 said, hey, tell your heart where to go

170
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,220
 and what to look for, don't do this baggage swap

171
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,380
 where you meet with someone and you say,

172
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,700
 hey, you take some of my baggage,

173
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,980
 I'll take some of your baggage,

174
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,900
 but actually leave someone better than you find them

175
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,060
 as you date them, as you spend time with them.

176
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,020
 If you do break up, if it doesn't end in marriage,

177
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,580
 then make them better for someone else, right?

178
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,220
 Hopefully the time that y'all spend together,

179
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,020
 you grow more godly together, that's what it looks like

180
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,220
 as two Christians would spend time together.

181
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,540
 And then week three, we talked about

182
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,100
 resetting our commitment.

183
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,860
 This idea that sex is a powerful gift,

184
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,540
 but outside of the context of marriage, it's destructive.

185
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,700
 That you can have sex outside of marriage,

186
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,820
 but then all of a sudden, you can't have that kind of sex

187
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,980
 inside of marriage, and I see that over and over and over,

188
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,320
 and we talked about how this crazy idea

189
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,580
 that the world says is insane,

190
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,320
 we talked about how purity is possible,

191
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,460
 and that there's people doing it,

192
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,060
 that if that's you, that you're not a weirdo,

193
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,620
 that it's God-ordained, it's absolutely possible.

194
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,620
 Well, tonight I wanna talk about resetting our expectations,

195
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,860
 how you and I, how we respond,

196
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,900
 or should respond when our expectations aren't met.

197
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,500
 And so we're gonna talk about

198
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,860
 dealing with disappointments in dating,

199
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,820
 dealing with despair in dating, and dealing with divorce.

200
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,660
 And before you leave, I hope I can give you a glimpse

201
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,060
 of what it looks like to doing it right,

202
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,100
 and I hope you'll stay in there with me 'til the end, okay?

203
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,540
 I think there'll be temptation.

204
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,940
 If you hear something that rubs you the wrong way,

205
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,060
 you'll walk out, and I hope you'll hang in there with me,

206
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,340
 so that we can really see what God has to say in this.

207
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,900
 Let me start in 1 Corinthians 13.

208
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,400
 It's the chapter in your Bible on love, okay?

209
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,100
 And so in verse four, it just says this.

210
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,540
 Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy,

211
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,020
 it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude,

212
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,060
 it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,

213
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,340
 it keeps no record of wrongs, love does not delight in evil,

214
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,820
 but rejoices with the truth, it always protects,

215
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,060
 always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres,

216
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,860
 and it's a really high bar.

217
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,580
 It's like, well, how am I supposed to do that?

218
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,940
 Keep no records of wrongs, always persevere, always trust?

219
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,940
 How am I supposed to always trust?

220
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,460
 And then he says this.

221
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,100
 When I was a child, verse 11, when I was a child,

222
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,940
 I talked like a child, I thought like a child,

223
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,380
 I reasoned like a child, but when I became a man,

224
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,460
 I put childish ways behind me.

225
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:44,460
 When I grew up, I stopped with the childish fantasies.

226
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,600
 I put Disney away, and I started pursuing something else

227
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,260
 to inform what it would mean to love.

228
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,220
 Greater love has no one than this,

229
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,740
 that he would die for us.

230
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,700
 That Christ would die for us.

231
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,700
 Last night, my little girl, my four-year-old,

232
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,840
 love her, she says the craziest things, she's so funny,

233
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,380
 and I'm tucking her into bed, and we're reading a story,

234
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,500
 and she's just out of nowhere.

235
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,700
 The way that we handled the Santa Claus thing

236
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,060
 is we just told them, hey, there's a secret about Santa,

237
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
 'cause we want them to trust us,

238
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,900
 you know, we don't ever wanna lie,

239
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,180
 and we want them to be able to have fun,

240
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,920
 and so just as we celebrate Santa, and do it big,

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,780
 and leave him milk and cookies,

242
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,020
 I just always tell them, hey, remember,

243
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,220
 there's a secret about Santa, one day you're gonna know,

244
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,500
 and I'm telling you right now, there's a secret about Santa.

245
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,540
 Last night, I'm reading her the Bible story,

246
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,380
 and out of nowhere, she goes,

247
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,780
 "Daddy, what's the secret about Santa?"

248
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,500
 And I'm like, baby girl, I can't tell you.

249
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,260
 And I tuck her in, I go in the living room,

250
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,260
 and I'm writing, and I just hear her wailing in there.

251
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,780
 You know, like, just, I'm talking, crying, like,

252
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,220
 (panting)

253
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,620
 just like, crying hysterically in there.

254
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,700
 And, you know, and I'm listening, and she goes,

255
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,700
 "You hurt my feelings, you hurt my feelings."

256
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,340
 And so I go in, and I'm like, Finley Bear, what's wrong?

257
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,340
 And she's like, "You won't tell me the secret about Santa."

258
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,780
 I'm like, baby girl, listen, there's a secret,

259
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,020
 I'm telling you there's a secret, I want you to find out.

260
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,980
 And she's like, "Well, I just wanna know."

261
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,380
 And she's so disappointed that I won't tell her this thing,

262
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,900
 this, you know, this little joke.

263
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,340
 Santa's not real, by the way.

264
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,340
 Somebody's crying back.

265
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,660
 (congregation laughing)

266
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,500
 Sorry.

267
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,020
 Here's the deal.

268
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,940
 It's funny when you're three, or four, she's four.

269
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,100
 It's funny when you're four.

270
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,260
 You know, she hasn't learned how to

271
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,540
 deal with disappointment.

272
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,380
 But some of us, man, we're 24, maybe 34.

273
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,420
 He doesn't love me.

274
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,020
 It's not so funny, though.

275
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,020
 You know, it's less funny.

276
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,780
 And the scripture says, hey, when are we gonna stop

277
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,580
 fantasizing about this thing, that there's gonna be

278
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,780
 this Prince Charming that's gonna swoop in,

279
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,380
 we're gonna leave, I know you wanna believe

280
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,260
 that that hope is real.

281
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,620
 But I'll tell you that men and women are miserable saviors.

282
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,900
 Miserable saviors.

283
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,740
 And so let's just talk about dealing with disappointment.

284
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,620
 What does it look like when our expectations aren't met,

285
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,460
 dealing with disappointment?

286
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,860
 Proverbs 16, nine says this, that in his heart,

287
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,420
 a man plans his course.

288
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,020
 In his heart, a man says, I want that.

289
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,940
 In his heart, a man or a woman says,

290
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,140
 I want the white picket fence and the suburban home

291
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,540
 and the German shepherd and the two kids,

292
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,100
 one boy, one girl.

293
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,180
 But the Lord determines his and her steps.

294
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,540
 And so you may not be where you had hoped,

295
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,380
 but you must trust that God is at work,

296
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,180
 that tonight you may have came in here

297
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,780
 and maybe you thought by now, man, I thought surely

298
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,180
 by the time I'm 32, I would be married.

299
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,620
 By the time I'm 39, I thought surely that I would be married

300
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,820
 and so you had these expectations and just as I said earlier

301
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,700
 your greatest disappointments come from your expectations

302
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,300
 and if you're not careful, those will turn into despair,

303
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,900
 those will turn into depression,

304
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,700
 those will turn into darkness.

305
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,260
 And so the question that I have for you tonight right now,

306
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,700
 just as we look at Proverbs 69 is do you trust

307
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,540
 that God is good and that God is in control?

308
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,980
 And you've gotta answer that.

309
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,180
 Do you trust that God is good and God is in control?

310
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,060
 But as I thought about that, I want you to know,

311
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,740
 'cause I don't wanna give you bad dating advice,

312
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,140
 I want you to know there's two kinds of trusting God.

313
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
 Okay, there's a passive trusting.

314
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,340
 This is what that looks like.

315
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,860
 It's like when you look around

316
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,460
 and your circumstances aren't met

317
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,540
 or you are in a situation of unwanted circumstances,

318
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,600
 okay, you trust that God is in control of that.

319
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,660
 You stop where you are, you acknowledge,

320
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,500
 hey God, you are God, I am not God and you are in control.

321
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,180
 You have numbered my days ahead of time

322
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,820
 and you are on your throne and all power and honor

323
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,180
 and glory is yours.

324
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,600
 I trust you.

325
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,520
 Okay, and then there's an active trusting.

326
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,180
 This is Proverbs 3, five and six.

327
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,260
 It says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart

328
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,520
 "and lean not on your own understanding,

329
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,540
 "but in all your ways acknowledge him."

330
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,160
 In the Hebrew, it's not like acknowledge,

331
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,420
 it's like the trajectory of your life

332
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,720
 acknowledges that there is a God.

333
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,380
 In all your ways acknowledge him

334
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,020
 and he will make your path straight.

335
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,120
 He will set your path straight.

336
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,100
 This active trusting is, hey God,

337
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,660
 I wanna know what you have said is good

338
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,260
 and I wanna pursue it.

339
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,860
 God, I wanna test the desires of my heart

340
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,620
 with the instruction that you have given me

341
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,060
 and then I want to pursue them

342
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,420
 if they are good and consistent with you.

343
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,500
 So don't say, 'cause some of you guys are like,

344
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,900
 well, the reason that I'm not married

345
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,300
 is because I'm waiting for God to bring me a wife.

346
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,660
 And I'm just telling you,

347
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,060
 like while you're playing World of Warcraft or whatever,

348
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,300
 like she's not gonna fall through the ceiling

349
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,920
 onto your lap and a pastor pop up

350
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,700
 or come down the chimney and say,

351
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,260
 here we are, let's do this deal.

352
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,980
 Like that's not gonna happen.

353
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
 There is a part of this deal

354
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,380
 where you have to actively pursue her.

355
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,860
 And the scripture says,

356
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,740
 he who finds a wife finds a good thing.

357
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,940
 So should you want a wife, you should look for a wife.

358
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,900
 Ladies, amen?

359
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
 Okay, okay.

360
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,840
 (congregation laughing)

361
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:37,220
 And so I think some of us thought that

362
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,980
 not just that we'd be married by now,

363
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,940
 but that we'd be married to a particular person by now.

364
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,740
 Like maybe you hope that he would have

365
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,740
 bought that ring by now.

366
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,900
 Or maybe you're looking back

367
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,100
 and wondering what he's doing right now

368
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,220
 or where he's at or what city he's in right now.

369
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,620
 And so some of us are,

370
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,480
 or when I'm going to meet him right now.

371
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,300
 Where is he, God, have you forgotten me?

372
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,080
 Have you forsaken me?

373
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,420
 The scripture says no.

374
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,180
 I think some of us were chasing the one, you know?

375
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,060
 The one, you guys remember the one?

376
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
 We always talk about that every year,

377
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,620
 we gotta talk about the one.

378
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,620
 The one is out there on a unicorn in Fantasia somewhere.

379
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
 (congregation laughing)

380
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,580
 Let me hit you with this.

381
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,780
 And this is gonna blow some of your minds, okay?

382
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,100
 There is no one.

383
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,160
 There's ones.

384
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,540
 Like there's people that you can choose from,

385
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,780
 but there's no one.

386
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,200
 And I'll tell you to kind of help you out,

387
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,300
 the pool from which you can date from,

388
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,040
 it's a relatively small pool, okay?

389
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 It's those, you know, you look at the world,

390
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,900
 it's full of people who do not follow Jesus.

391
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,620
 And so it's like, you know, a lot of the world,

392
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,760
 you're like, hey, well, none of them.

393
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,500
 And then you look what's left,

394
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,800
 and it's like, okay, these are the people

395
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,380
 who are passionately, with their lives, seeking Christ.

396
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,580
 And so these are the folks that I can choose from.

397
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,820
 You know, not just someone like check the box,

398
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,300
 like I had this experience around six,

399
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,460
 but like today, I am currently running after Jesus.

400
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,440
 That you would be that person,

401
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 and that you would look for that person.

402
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,940
 And so let me hit on this one thing for a second,

403
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,200
 as I always do.

404
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,520
 People are like, what do you mean there's not a one?

405
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,700
 Somebody's always mind blown on that.

406
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
 And so I just ask like this,

407
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,780
 was I the one for Monica?

408
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,360
 And before you shut up, the answer is yes, and here's why.

409
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,020
 Because we went down the aisle together,

410
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,400
 and we sat in front of that pastor,

411
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,280
 and we made a covenant before God together.

412
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,360
 Do you know the difference between a covenant

413
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
 and a commitment?

414
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,600
 A commitment is a if-then statement.

415
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,260
 A commitment is if you do this, then I will.

416
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,520
 A commitment, it's an if-then, it's a hey,

417
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,100
 if you meet your terms, then I'm going to meet my terms,

418
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,720
 and if you don't meet your terms,

419
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,080
 then I can do these, I can take this action.

420
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,000
 A covenant is I will, regardless of what you do.

421
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,740
 A covenant is you standing before God,

422
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,320
 saying hey, I will do this,

423
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,920
 for better or worse, sickness and health,

424
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,560
 till death do us part,

425
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,400
 regardless, if she loses her mind,

426
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,720
 I'll be there.

427
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,800
 All right, so now let me ask you this.

428
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,640
 Is there someone better for Monica?

429
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
 And the answer is a resounding yes.

430
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
 Lots of them.

431
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,040
 You get that, mind blown?

432
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,660
 Stay with me.

433
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,160
 Okay, there are guys out there

434
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,800
 that love more, I mean, more compatible for her.

435
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,300
 There's guys out there, you know, she's 5'3", I'm 6'7".

436
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,940
 There's shorter guys.

437
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,480
 There's guys that don't like guns and motorcycles like I do.

438
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,400
 You know, she doesn't love guns and motorcycles.

439
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
 There are guys out there, there's hundreds,

440
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,920
 maybe hundreds of thousands of guys

441
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,200
 that would be better suited for Monica than me.

442
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
 Maybe hundreds of thousands of girls

443
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,840
 that would be better suited for me than Monica.

444
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,980
 But we found each other,

445
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,520
 and we committed to each other.

446
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,040
 Crazy, huh?

447
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
 It's crazy.

448
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,760
 And we committed, so we're doing this thing together, right?

449
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,680
 We're running together.

450
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,520
 There's no one, there's these ones

451
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,160
 that God has said, "Hey, choose from these people."

452
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,480
 Even as Abraham sent Eleazar to find a wife for his son,

453
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,960
 he said, "Hey, go to these select people

454
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,300
 "and choose someone for him."

455
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,920
 All right.

456
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,960
 And so you're not waiting to be swept away in some fantasy.

457
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
 You're growing more godly.

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
 These are not these days that we waste.

459
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
 You're not lesser of a person

460
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,120
 because you're a single person.

461
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,160
 In fact, you're the engine of the church

462
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,880
 as a single person.

463
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
 Single people are the most well-resourced,

464
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
 have the most time.

465
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,800
 You are the engine of the church.

466
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
 That's why God, that's why Jesus used a bunch

467
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,960
 of young adults to change the world.

468
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,800
 That's why he did it.

469
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,720
 I believe wholeheartedly.

470
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,260
 You read the scriptures, look at the disciples.

471
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,360
 Between the ages of 18 and 32, Jesus says,

472
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,680
 "Hey, give me some young adults, I'll change the world."

473
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,120
 'Cause they were ready and willing.

474
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,480
 It's game time, you're in your prime.

475
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,640
 We've said that before.

476
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,680
 And so what do you need?

477
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,920
 What do you need to meet the one?

478
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,800
 It's pretty simple, man.

479
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,720
 You need to be in the same location geographically.

480
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,540
 You have to see each other.

481
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,300
 You need to be in the same location spiritually.

482
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,440
 All right?

483
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,820
 You need to be in the same location spiritually.

484
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,960
 The scripture says, "Equally yoked."

485
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,800
 Second Corinthians 6, verse 14.

486
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,240
 Same location spiritually.

487
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,520
 You need to be traveling the same direction.

488
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,200
 Right, hey, we're both running towards God.

489
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,520
 The trajectory of our life is that we believe

490
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,800
 that there's a God and we're gonna die

491
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,720
 and we're gonna go be with him.

492
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,400
 And so we use this life for that.

493
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,800
 And then lastly, you know, compatibility, romance,

494
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,120
 I don't, you know, chemistry.

495
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
 I would say you need to be able to ride

496
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
 in the same car together.

497
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
 And more, and before you scoff at that,

498
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,200
 let me say this.

499
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,080
 There's gonna be days where you don't want to.

500
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,160
 So before you think that's crazy,

501
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,280
 there's gonna be days where you're like,

502
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,560
 I would rather ride in the car

503
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,760
 with any other single breathing person than you.

504
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,240
 And so write that down.

505
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
 Say, JP said this, I think he's a liar,

506
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,260
 so that you can come back and say,

507
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,240
 well, man, I repent.

508
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,840
 (congregation laughing)

509
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,240
 So you are becoming something.

510
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,080
 God is at work in you, right?

511
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,240
 He's at work in you.

512
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,220
 And so I pray that the trajectory of your life

513
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,640
 would be you pursuing Jesus.

514
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
 The reality of it is,

515
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
 and it's interesting, I've been hearing this lately,

516
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,800
 like, people are like, man, I've been doing

517
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,300
 what you said, it didn't work.

518
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,480
 What does work, like, you mean you didn't get married

519
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,320
 in two weeks?

520
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,680
 What does that mean, it didn't work?

521
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,840
 Well, you know, she said, no,

522
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,220
 that doesn't mean it didn't work.

523
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,060
 Don't you understand, like, this is a refining moment.

524
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,320
 This is God working, it's okay,

525
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,960
 like a no doesn't mean it didn't work.

526
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,680
 A breakup doesn't mean it didn't work.

527
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,600
 See, the process is not about you getting married,

528
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,160
 but you growing godly.

529
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 And you can grow godly through a breakup.

530
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
 You can grow godly through a no.

531
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,480
 You do that by navigating those waters with honesty.

532
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,760
 By asking questions, hey, help me understand.

533
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,200
 Hey, how could I have loved or cared for you better in this?

534
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,040
 And you grow more godly, and whatever you're doing,

535
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,360
 if you're doing it His way, it will work.

536
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,160
 People say, well, I'm gonna give Christian dating a shot.

537
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,360
 What does that mean, Christian dating?

538
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,100
 If you're Christian and you're dating,

539
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,700
 you're Christian dating, right?

540
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,920
 I mean, right, I'm just confused by that.

541
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,960
 It's like, Christians would be like,

542
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
 well, I'm gonna give secular dating a shot.

543
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,240
 What does that?

544
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
 (congregation laughing)

545
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,920
 No, give pursuing Christ a shot.

546
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
 Don't give it a shot, give it your life.

547
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,800
 And then what comes out of that

548
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,920
 will be out of the overflow of those things.

549
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,240
 See, I think that,

550
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,320
 I think that God is using our challenges

551
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,680
 and our disappointments to grow us into His man or woman.

552
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,440
 I've been doing this thing,

553
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,240
 this vocational ministry thing for six years now,

554
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,800
 and I've met with hundreds and hundreds

555
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,920
 of hurting married folks.

556
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,020
 And I've realized there are, I've never,

557
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,160
 I'll just say, I personally,

558
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,720
 I've never met someone with marital problems.

559
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,760
 Every person I've met had single people problems

560
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,120
 they brought into marriage.

561
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,480
 You tracking with that?

562
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,720
 Like their marriage problems

563
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,500
 were problems before they were married,

564
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,000
 and they brought them into marriage,

565
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,840
 and then they didn't know how to work that out

566
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,120
 with someone else.

567
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,240
 And I think as we work through that conflict,

568
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,640
 as we grow through that, God is working in our hearts.

569
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,680
 He says this in James,

570
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,280
 "Consider it pure joy, my brothers,

571
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,080
 "whenever you face trials of many kinds,

572
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,400
 "because you know that the testing of your faith

573
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,720
 "develops perseverance,

574
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,440
 "and perseverance must finish its work

575
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,080
 "so that you may be mature and complete,

576
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,640
 "not lacking anything."

577
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,140
 See, your faith is being tested in dating.

578
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,020
 Your faith is getting tested in dating.

579
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,860
 I get asked all the time,

580
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,620
 "Well, what does it look like if I'm a guy,

581
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,300
 "I know the Scriptures say that I'm supposed to lead,

582
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,000
 "what does it look like to lead as a guy in a relationship?"

583
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
 Simple, my answer to that is simple.

584
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,880
 You lead in purity.

585
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,080
 See, here's the reality.

586
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,240
 If he can help, if he can guard himself

587
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,040
 against his greatest urge, right,

588
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,280
 he's probably gonna do all right at keeping the lights on,

589
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,160
 you know, paying the bills and keeping the kids fed.

590
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,660
 Like, if he can protect himself,

591
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,320
 if he can be self-controlled or controlled by the Spirit

592
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,560
 enough to lead you towards purity,

593
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,000
 he's probably gonna be an all right provider,

594
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,480
 and he's probably gonna be faithful to you,

595
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,100
 but likewise, if he can't,

596
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,980
 his faithfulness to you, it's a guess.

597
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,120
 It's a shot in the dark.

598
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,200
 We'll see.

599
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,040
 It's a gamble.

600
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,080
 It's a gamble.

601
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,540
 And so, if you haven't found that guy,

602
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,640
 if you haven't found that girl, don't be discouraged.

603
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,840
 We talked about how discouragement can lead to despair,

604
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,080
 and so the second thing I wanna cover

605
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,240
 is just this idea of dealing with despair.

606
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,560
 Dealing with despair.

607
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,120
 See, maybe the person you thought you'd end up with

608
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 broke your heart.

609
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,720
 Breakups are hard.

610
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,640
 It's an understatement.

611
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,680
 Breakups are difficult.

612
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,480
 And so, let's just talk through that for a second.

613
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,640
 If you're in a breakup or you're going through a breakup,

614
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,760
 would you do this for me?

615
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,960
 Would you just be honest?

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,840
 Okay, don't drag God into your breakup.

617
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,040
 Don't drag God into your excuse.

618
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,360
 "Well, I just feel the Lord is, you know,

619
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
 "I just think God is just telling me."

620
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,880
 Just say, "Hey, I'm not feeling this anymore."

621
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,360
 That's the truth.

622
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,720
 I don't need to over-spiritualize this.

623
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,640
 And maybe we didn't do a great job

624
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
 of guarding our hearts in that.

625
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,800
 I know that's ambiguous and people tend to hate it,

626
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,160
 this idea of guarding your hearts.

627
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,800
 And so, you may hurt and I may hurt,

628
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,240
 and the reality of it is we need to go our separate ways.

629
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,560
 I don't know what the truth is, right?

630
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,960
 It may be like, "I don't like your hair,"

631
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
 but whatever the truth is,

632
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
 I'm just saying, "Hey, just use the truth."

633
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,900
 You don't have to over-spiritualize it.

634
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,280
 You don't have to say something that it's not.

635
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,660
 You don't have to be scared.

636
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,600
 The Lord gave you a spirit of power and love

637
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,920
 and self-discipline, not a spirit of timidity,

638
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,320
 the scripture says.

639
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,360
 You can sit there and respectfully look somebody

640
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,360
 in the eyes and say, "Hey, let me just be honest with you.

641
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,800
 "Because I'm a Christian and that's what we do,

642
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,560
 "we're honest.

643
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,320
 "And I don't need to over-spiritualize it.

644
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,160
 "I don't need to make it God's fault."

645
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,200
 That's like when I spank my girls,

646
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,120
 I'm like, "Well, God said I have to, you know?"

647
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,600
 That's not gonna increase their view of God.

648
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,280
 Hey, I know you're really, really hurt right now,

649
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,480
 but it's God's fault.

650
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,160
 Okay, like I know you wanna blame me for this,

651
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,680
 but the reality of it is it's God's fault.

652
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,040
 No, it's not.

653
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,840
 It's not God's fault.

654
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,680
 Okay.

655
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,520
 And so, let me say this.

656
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,240
 If your brother or sister has sinned against you

657
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,680
 in that relationship, you go and you tell them, honestly.

658
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,560
 You say, "Hey, you've sinned against me.

659
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,400
 "You have hurt me.

660
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
 "I think you've done something

661
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,480
 "that contradicts the scriptures."

662
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,800
 But if you're hurt because of their actions,

663
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,760
 like you're hurt is just the product

664
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,160
 of their feelings drifting.

665
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,040
 Like if you're hurt is the product of their feelings,

666
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,400
 but they haven't sinned against you,

667
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,360
 then it's okay.

668
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,200
 You need to know this.

669
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,080
 It is okay to be hurt, okay?

670
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,200
 But the reality of it is, is hurt people hurt people,

671
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,880
 and it's not okay to hurt people.

672
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,920
 Okay, so you take a deep breath.

673
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,320
 You know, take a deep breath.

674
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,320
 Call your girlfriends, call your guy friends, respectively,

675
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 and say, "Hey, here's where I'm at.

676
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,160
 "I'm hurting, and I wanna hurt someone.

677
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,480
 "I wanna call him right now,

678
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,200
 "after a shot of tequila at 2 a.m."

679
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
 You know, or whatever that is, right?

680
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,160
 But I'm not gonna do that.

681
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,880
 That's not who I am.

682
00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:00,960
 So maybe you're realizing that right now,

683
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,160
 the despair in your life as we go through this series

684
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,060
 that you've done some terrible things.

685
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,080
 You know, maybe that guy who had your heart

686
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,280
 convinced you to do things with him

687
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,760
 that you swore you'd never do.

688
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,720
 And maybe you didn't need convincing.

689
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,360
 Like, maybe you're numb to sex, right?

690
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,560
 Maybe you're just kind of at this place where,

691
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,520
 "Hey, honestly, like, if a guy would give me attention,

692
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,360
 "like, I'll sleep with him.

693
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,240
 "It's no big deal.

694
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
 "That's just kinda where I'm at.

695
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,340
 "If a girl will show me some affection, whatever.

696
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,260
 "I'm down for whatever."

697
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,240
 Maybe that's where you're at.

698
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,860
 Maybe you came in tonight with addictions

699
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,160
 that you've never even called addictions.

700
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,400
 And it's all of a sudden, you lift your head up,

701
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,320
 and you realize this porn thing's been going on

702
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,120
 since the fifth grade.

703
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,780
 It's been over a decade, over two.

704
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,880
 You're like, "Man, I think I got a problem.

705
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,120
 "I've just been thinking that it's gonna fix itself.

706
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,460
 "Maybe you've been raped.

707
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,780
 "Maybe you've gone through sexual abuse,

708
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,580
 "and I'm not making light of that.

709
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,740
 "I hate that for you.

710
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,980
 "I hate that for you.

711
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,240
 "Maybe you have made the choice to have an abortion,

712
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,760
 "and I want you to know that God is good,

713
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,960
 "and He loves you, and He's crazy about you.

714
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,780
 "And now I've got a question for you.

715
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,660
 "What's your story gonna be?

716
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,240
 "What's your story gonna be?

717
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,840
 "What story are you gonna write?

718
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,080
 "Are you gonna be that girl

719
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,020
 "that swears she's never gonna tell anyone

720
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,320
 "about that abortion, and she's gonna take it to her grave?

721
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,480
 "Are you gonna be that girl that says,

722
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,760
 "'Hey, I had an abortion,

723
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,880
 "'and I wanna help others who have had abortions

724
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
 "'come from the bondage that I felt from that decision?'

725
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,020
 "Are you gonna be the girl that says,

726
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,860
 "'Yeah, you know what?

727
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,140
 "'I'm addicted to pornography, and I'm a girl,

728
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,040
 "'and girls don't talk about that,

729
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,760
 "'but I wanna fight the porn industry now.

730
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,700
 "'I wanna take my life and my story and my struggle,

731
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,000
 "'and I wanna set other people free from it.'

732
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,380
 "Are you gonna be the guy

733
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,580
 "that has sexual abuse occurred to you,

734
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,180
 "and so now you walk around as a victim,

735
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,980
 "carrying that burden on your shoulders?

736
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,080
 "Are you gonna be that guy that says,

737
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,960
 "'Yeah, you know, my uncle did that thing to me,

738
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,420
 "'but I wanna help you, and you, and you, and you.

739
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,900
 "'Would you guys come and follow me,

740
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
 "'and can we sit and we talk about

741
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,100
 "'what's your story gonna be?'

742
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,840
 "Are you gonna be that person?"

743
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,240
 And you look backwards, and you realize

744
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,380
 it's hundreds of partners, or dozens of partners,

745
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,940
 or five partners.

746
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,580
 And you're like, "You know, that's not who I am, though.

747
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,180
 "I'm not that guy, I'm not that girl.

748
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,280
 "I've been made new in Christ,

749
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,900
 "and so I'm gonna use my story to minister to others."

750
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,360
 'Cause 2 Corinthians 5:17 says that,

751
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,940
 "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

752
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,780
 "The old has gone, and the new has come."

753
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,340
 And so you, my friends, are not defined by your past.

754
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,740
 You're defined by Christ's past,

755
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,880
 and he's redefining your future.

756
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,040
 You're not defined by your past.

757
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,380
 You're defined by Jesus's past,

758
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,880
 and he's changing your future.

759
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,680
 And it's time that you found hope in that,

760
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,300
 'cause I think as so-called Christians,

761
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,940
 we're walking around defeated,

762
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,800
 and that was never his intentions.

763
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,000
 2 Corinthians 7, verse 10 says

764
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,680
 that there's this godly sorrow, this godly despair,

765
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,680
 that brings repentance, that leads to salvation, freedom,

766
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,420
 and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow,

767
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,700
 shame, guilt, brings death.

768
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,500
 See, I think often our disappointments

769
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,140
 and our despair brings us to things

770
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,780
 that we never thought would be,

771
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,180
 we never hoped to be, we never even fantasized about,

772
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,680
 and so one of those things is divorce.

773
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,000
 And before we wrap up this series,

774
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,840
 we just wanna talk about that.

775
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,760
 I know that's a lot of your stories here tonight,

776
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,200
 and here's the crazy truth.

777
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,040
 I'm just gonna hit you with this.

778
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,600
 It hurts my heart to even say this.

779
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,640
 For about over half of you, it will be your story.

780
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,800
 For over half of the faces I'm looking at right now,

781
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,480
 it's gonna be your story.

782
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,400
 I know all of you are like, "Not me."

783
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,680
 Like you've seen the Disney movie

784
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,320
 where the prince comes in and rescues her,

785
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,360
 and they fall in love, and then they get a divorce?

786
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,940
 No, you haven't seen that one.

787
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,360
 Right, that's not the one Disney makes.

788
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,520
 And I know it wasn't the thing you fantasized about

789
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,360
 when you were growing up,

790
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,960
 or were a little girl or a little guy,

791
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,280
 and so let's just talk about dealing with divorce.

792
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,900
 First of all, for those who haven't been married,

793
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,480
 let me say to you, divorce is not an option, okay?

794
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,980
 And so for those of you that have gone through that,

795
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,560
 maybe you didn't know, maybe you hadn't read the scriptures,

796
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,800
 grace abounds, God forgives your new creations.

797
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,080
 But for those of you who haven't been married,

798
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,600
 we're gonna skew that statistic,

799
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,440
 because my prayer for all of us is that we would get married

800
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,080
 and none of us would get a divorce.

801
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,320
 We know in Malachi 2:16, God says that he hates divorce,

802
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,640
 but God does not hate the divorced.

803
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,720
 You need to know that.

804
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,120
 He hates divorce, he hates the sin,

805
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
 he doesn't hate the sinner.

806
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,160
 He loves the sinner.

807
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,980
 And so divorce is not an option.

808
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,140
 I want you to know for me it was.

809
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,860
 Divorce was absolutely an option.

810
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,300
 In fact, I was so immature in my thinking,

811
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,860
 like I was just kinda looking at this girl,

812
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,640
 she was my best friend's sister,

813
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,740
 and I loved her family, and I was like,

814
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,100
 man, I don't know, like I might as well get married.

815
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,160
 You know, it'll be great, it's gonna be awesome.

816
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,660
 Like I had all of these expectations,

817
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,500
 it'll be sex every night,

818
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,260
 and we have one big giant sexcapade,

819
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,180
 everybody knows that's what marriage is, you know.

820
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,520
 I'm gonna learn Victoria's secret, you know.

821
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,180
 And then we get there,

822
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,180
 and it didn't really happen like that,

823
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,780
 it's not really what played out.

824
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,860
 And I just thought, hey, if this isn't what happened,

825
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,400
 if that's not how it goes, then we'll just jump out,

826
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,240
 no big deal.

827
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,640
 We'll just jump out, no big deal.

828
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,640
 Get out of this thing, everybody's doing it, 52% of people.

829
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,360
 So we'll just get out.

830
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,520
 And so about two years into marriage,

831
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,060
 like where I'm at, I'm so immature,

832
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,720
 and this isn't that long ago, you know,

833
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,560
 I'm embarrassed to tell you,

834
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,760
 and so I'm throwing around the D word.

835
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,840
 I don't know how to love a girl,

836
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,600
 like I had dated like a lot of you date,

837
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,520
 which is serial dating, I jumped in a relationship,

838
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,600
 and when it went wrong, I jumped out,

839
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,800
 and I jumped in another relationship,

840
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,920
 and it went wrong, I jumped out.

841
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,640
 Now is that training for marriage,

842
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,200
 or is that training for divorce?

843
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,640
 See, this is why dating's important.

844
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,040
 See, I had trained for divorce.

845
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,880
 I had trained myself, I had conditioned myself for divorce.

846
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,460
 And so here we were in marriage,

847
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,840
 and I'm like, man, I'll just, you know,

848
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,000
 you wanna act crazy, I'll just jump out.

849
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,600
 It was really me acting crazy.

850
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,020
 And it wasn't until I realized,

851
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,180
 like I started reading this,

852
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,320
 and I realized that out wasn't an option,

853
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,840
 and I'm like, man, if I'm gonna be with this woman

854
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,760
 for the rest of my life, I better start loving her,

855
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,560
 and I'm like, how should I love her?

856
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,080
 Yes, Christ loved the church,

857
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,240
 but Christ died for the church,

858
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,980
 gave himself for her, it's Ephesians 5:25.

859
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,040
 Man, I better start giving my life for this woman.

860
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
 And when I started doing that,

861
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,900
 everything changed in our marriage.

862
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,220
 She became this incredible woman of God,

863
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,000
 this amazing woman, she really already was,

864
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,960
 I just couldn't see it, 'cause I was so wicked.

865
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,260
 I was so messed up in my head,

866
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,720
 my expectations were so whack, and I was so angry.

867
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,440
 But when I realized that divorce wasn't an option,

868
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,980
 marriage finally was.

869
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,560
 Marriage finally was an option.

870
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,400
 And so I think the best training for marriage,

871
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,480
 and I want you to hear me on this,

872
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
 'cause this is important, people never believe me on this,

873
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,680
 and I promise you it's true, you're gonna find out.

874
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,080
 I think the best training for marriage

875
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,440
 is dealing with conflict well.

876
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,480
 That's the very best way for you to train for your marriage,

877
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,540
 is to have a roommate, a really dysfunctional roommate.

878
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,320
 Like one that leaves the dishes out,

879
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,140
 and doesn't pay rent on time,

880
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,880
 like that is excellent training for marriage, you know?

881
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,080
 Monica's like, babe, have you paid this bill?

882
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,320
 I haven't, you know?

883
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,760
 I'm that dysfunctional roommate.

884
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,980
 Monica has that dysfunctional roommate,

885
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,760
 leaves the dishes in the sink,

886
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,800
 that's great training for marriage.

887
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,340
 For you to go to your community group,

888
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,880
 and when you really hate the person

889
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,680
 that you're sitting across the circle with,

890
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,320
 you're diligent, the scripture says,

891
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
 in preserving the unity of the spirit,

892
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,320
 and the bond of peace.

893
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,440
 You take that conflict head on,

894
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,520
 you remove the log in your eye,

895
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,820
 you say, what have I done?

896
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,400
 What is my part in this conflict?

897
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,440
 I am committed to resolving it with you,

898
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,800
 because we are both brothers and sisters in Christ.

899
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,040
 And so we must bring down these walls.

900
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,240
 We will wrestle with this until there is forgiveness

901
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,080
 between brothers and sisters in Christ.

902
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,960
 That is incredible training for marriage.

903
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,660
 And so if you've been divorced,

904
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,640
 I want you to know that he's crazy about you,

905
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,200
 he loves you.

906
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,800
 I want you to know that there's grace there.

907
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,960
 I'm the product of divorce,

908
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,320
 both my parents had been married before,

909
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,080
 got divorced, remarried, had me,

910
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
 still married now.

911
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,280
 The first wedding I ever did here at Watermark,

912
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,400
 I had never even in my life considered divorce

913
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
 and remarriage, 'cause there's two options here,

914
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,200
 and I want you to hear this.

915
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,960
 There's divorce, like so, can we get a divorce?

916
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,920
 And then there's, can we get remarried?

917
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,640
 And they're not no-brainers.

918
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,360
 Like, it is possible that you can get a divorce, okay?

919
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,840
 It's possible, and you don't remarry,

920
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,680
 and you stay single.

921
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,060
 Like, you gotta wrestle with the scriptures

922
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,380
 that are there so that you can find the life

923
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,960
 that God has ordained for you,

924
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,440
 to say, hey God, here's where I'm at.

925
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,640
 Is this an allotment for me,

926
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,560
 because of the broken world that we live in,

927
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,600
 is this possible?

928
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,520
 And so the first wedding I did was this girl,

929
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,720
 and we're wrestling, and I'm walking through the details

930
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,260
 of her first marriage, and what's so crazy

931
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,920
 about the stories, I actually saw them this weekend

932
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,520
 at a marriage conference I was speaking at right here,

933
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,200
 and it was this incredible thing,

934
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,920
 'cause I remember this like it was yesterday.

935
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,800
 I went to her fiance, and I said,

936
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,900
 I think she needs to pursue reconciliation,

937
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,480
 to her ex-husband.

938
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,400
 And he said, what?

939
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,240
 Could you imagine?

940
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,240
 Like, he loves this woman.

941
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,640
 He's like, what?

942
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,760
 He goes home, he reads the scriptures,

943
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,700
 and he says, she absolutely does.

944
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,760
 He says, I'm gonna call with her.

945
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,480
 And he calls her ex-husband with her.

946
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,280
 It's crazy.

947
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,400
 I sat there with the ex-husband on speakerphone,

948
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,440
 and he had remarried, we didn't know that.

949
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,580
 And so now he can walk,

950
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,000
 knowing that he was faithful, that she was faithful,

951
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 as they stewarded that in their lives.

952
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,840
 How great is that?

953
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,720
 Let me show you what the scripture says,

954
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,420
 and again, if this is your story,

955
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,560
 I don't say this to judge or to take blame.

956
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,560
 I say this because I'm committed to teaching the Bible,

957
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,780
 and this is what it says.

958
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,200
 Jesus, chapter 19 of Matthew, verse three.

959
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,600
 "Some Pharisees came to him and said,

960
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,560
 "they asked, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife

961
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,160
 "for any and every reason?

962
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,700
 "Jesus responds, haven't you read, he replied,

963
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,800
 "that at the beginning the Creator made them male?"

964
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,280
 So they're asking this question.

965
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,760
 Is it lawful to get a divorce?

966
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
 Jesus says, "Haven't you read, he replied,

967
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,300
 "that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female

968
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,460
 "and said, for this reason a man will leave his father

969
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,780
 "and mother and be united to his wife,

970
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,600
 "and the two will become one flesh,

971
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,680
 "so that they are no longer two but one.

972
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,940
 "Therefore what God has joined together,

973
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,400
 "let man not separate."

974
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,700
 And so in one word, what is Jesus' answer?

975
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,660
 No.

976
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,340
 Jesus takes the long road to answer the question,

977
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,000
 no, it's not lawful.

978
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,720
 What God has joined together, let man not separate.

979
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,380
 And so if you're hearing, and that's a part of your story,

980
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,060
 I know you feel justified in your divorce, frankly,

981
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,300
 because I've never met the person that's like,

982
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,880
 man, I got a divorce, and it was wrong.

983
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,460
 I mean, I have seen people actually remarry each other,

984
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,380
 but very rarely do I talk to that person and say,

985
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,220
 hey, I know that it was wrong.

986
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,480
 And so you may need to seriously,

987
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,540
 prayerfully consider reconciliation,

988
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,080
 and you may hate me for that.

989
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,840
 I'm well aware that I'm hated for that often,

990
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,220
 but it's for this reason, as I search the scriptures,

991
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,380
 that my personal conviction is that I won't remarry someone

992
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:54,840
 if reconciliation is an option,

993
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,020
 if their ex is alive or not remarried.

994
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,180
 And do you know that people hear that,

995
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,020
 and they actually leave, and they're like,

996
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,820
 that place is crazy, did you know

997
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,140
 that that's where they stand, the JP's crazy?

998
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,820
 Before you go there, I encourage you to do a little reading.

999
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,740
 Okay, 'cause I've been reading.

1000
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,880
 And just check out what the scripture says,

1001
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,620
 so that you can make an informed decision,

1002
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,540
 because the God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

1003
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,220
 he loves you, he's crazy about you,

1004
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,480
 and he has some desires for you.

1005
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,860
 Okay, he doesn't want to rip you off,

1006
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,980
 he wants to give you life abundantly,

1007
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,620
 the most amazing life that you could have ever imagined.

1008
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,820
 And so you may say, hey, of course,

1009
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,780
 I was justified in my divorce, but let's be honest,

1010
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,420
 you have no idea what God was going to do.

1011
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,400
 Because my God, he changes people.

1012
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,580
 And people are like, well, she was crazy.

1013
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,980
 I'm like, you married crazy.

1014
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,260
 Like, you chose crazy, right?

1015
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,820
 Like, you stood there before God and said,

1016
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,800
 hey, I want a covenant with crazy here.

1017
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,020
 (congregation laughing)

1018
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,120
 Right?

1019
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,420
 And you didn't, it wasn't if then,

1020
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,220
 it wasn't if she's not crazy, then,

1021
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,560
 it was, hey, if she goes crazy, I'm gonna stay with her.

1022
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,800
 That's why the notebook actually has some redeeming elements

1023
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,640
 in it, she went crazy.

1024
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,880
 And he, yeah, we brought it back to the notebook, I did.

1025
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,980
 (congregation laughing)

1026
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,900
 And he stayed with her.

1027
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,200
 God is at work.

1028
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,940
 Let's just end here, we'll talk about some disappointments

1029
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,920
 from the scriptures.

1030
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,260
 There's some real disappointments in the scriptures, okay?

1031
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,860
 There's some real despairs in the scriptures.

1032
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,920
 Let's go disappointments.

1033
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,780
 Abraham, okay, so God talks about,

1034
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,260
 so Abraham's God's man, man of faith,

1035
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,820
 he promised that he's gonna have a kid.

1036
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,660
 The problem with that is he's 75 years old,

1037
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,300
 this is Genesis 16, and so the reality of it is,

1038
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,780
 is after, you know, a decade goes by, some time goes by,

1039
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,980
 Abraham's like, hey God, can I trust you?

1040
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,220
 I don't think I can trust you anymore.

1041
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,620
 He stops trusting God, he takes matters in his own hands

1042
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,360
 and he has an affair with his servant.

1043
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,560
 But God makes good on his promise.

1044
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,760
 You think that when God said, hey, you're going to have

1045
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,820
 a child and a lot of time goes by and he doesn't have one,

1046
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,780
 that he's not dealing with disappointment?

1047
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,280
 He absolutely was.

1048
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,540
 We can talk about Isaac, his son for a minute, right?

1049
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,500
 He meets Rebecca, who seemed to be an amazing woman,

1050
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
 because she's at a place where servants hang out

1051
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,820
 and she's serving people, and so here's kind of

1052
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,640
 meeting your spouse 101, go to a place where servants

1053
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,420
 hang out and find someone serving people, right?

1054
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,380
 That's what we learned from the story of Isaac and Rebecca.

1055
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,440
 That's where she is, and so she's taking care of some folks.

1056
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,980
 They get married and everything seems to be good,

1057
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,380
 except for he goes, has to go to this Philistine king

1058
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,340
 of Bimelech, and he lies and says that she's his sister,

1059
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,420
 and the scripture implies that some of the Philistine army

1060
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,260
 is about to sleep with this woman because he lied.

1061
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,740
 Dealing with some disappointment, Isaac and Rebecca were,

1062
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,500
 and then there's Jacob, this is a crazy story.

1063
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,660
 The Bible has some crazy stories of despair and discouragement.

1064
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,740
 Jacob, right, sees this woman, falls in love with her.

1065
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,540
 Rachel goes to her dad, says, hey, I'll work seven years

1066
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,420
 for her, he does it, hey, ladies, marry a guy

1067
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,180
 that will work seven years for you, okay?

1068
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,500
 Moral to the story, works seven years for her, okay?

1069
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,500
 The wedding comes, the wedding night, and the dad tricks him

1070
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,740
 and he actually marries and sleeps with the older,

1071
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,300
 much less attractive sister.

1072
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,460
 That's crazy, he slept with the wrong girl.

1073
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,540
 Wakes up the next day like, what, who are you?

1074
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,220
 You know, was I drunk last night, what happened?

1075
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,300
 He probably was.

1076
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,500
 It's in your Bible.

1077
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,180
 And so, here's the deal.

1078
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,820
 Here's the deal, I wanted to hit you with this.

1079
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,500
 Leah's lot in life was to be married to a man

1080
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,540
 who actually was in love with her sister.

1081
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,220
 That was her lot in life, man.

1082
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,060
 You talk about disappointment, that actually feels

1083
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,500
 more like despair to me, that she would marry

1084
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,300
 that like her lot in life was to marry a man

1085
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,860
 who actually wanted to be married to her sister.

1086
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,740
 So let's talk about Tamar for a second, okay?

1087
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,140
 This is a real character.

1088
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,900
 Tamar marries Judah's son, Judah's son sins

1089
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,980
 and dies because of his sin, marries Judah's other son

1090
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,860
 who sins and dies because of his sin,

1091
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,540
 so now she's a widow twice, two times over.

1092
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,860
 Judah promises her his youngest son

1093
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,940
 and then he doesn't make good on that promise,

1094
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,260
 so she despairs, okay?

1095
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,260
 She's been abused and so she dresses up like a prostitute,

1096
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,020
 sleeps with her father-in-law and gets pregnant.

1097
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,380
 Crazy, despair.

1098
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,420
 Ruth, and before we go to Ruth, we'll talk about Rahab.

1099
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,900
 Married Salman, Rahab was a prostitute,

1100
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,220
 you probably heard of her, she hid some spies.

1101
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,340
 She had sex with men to honor foreign gods.

1102
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,500
 That was her job, she got paid for sex.

1103
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,140
 Okay, despair.

1104
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,580
 Ruth, her husband dies, she loses her husband,

1105
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,500
 she essentially goes with her mother-in-law,

1106
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,180
 she's begging for food, right?

1107
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,660
 She meets Rahab, the prostitute's son, Boaz.

1108
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,620
 She marries Boaz after her bold move,

1109
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,860
 Jedi game that Ruth had,

1110
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,860
 and so her and Boaz are now married, right?

1111
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,100
 And so that's kind of her lot in life.

1112
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,260
 And then lastly, we'll talk about David,

1113
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,860
 the man after God's own heart.

1114
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,100
 He had seven wives.

1115
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:35,540
 He has an affair with Bathsheba.

1116
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,140
 We're talking about divorce?

1117
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,260
 Like he doesn't say, "Hey, Bathsheba, go get a divorce."

1118
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,580
 He just kills her husband.

1119
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,500
 Crazy.

1120
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,740
 You're talking about despair?

1121
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,440
 These are crazy stories.

1122
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,860
 I wanna show you something.

1123
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,300
 See, none of these folks, you're like,

1124
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,380
 "JP, where are you going with this man?

1125
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,900
 "Lay in this plane.

1126
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,980
 "You gotta go home."

1127
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,380
 Here we go.

1128
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,020
 None of these guys fantasized that that would be their story.

1129
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,140
 Leah, as a little girl, dreamed of Disney

1130
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,780
 and be like, "Man, I hope I marry this guy

1131
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,580
 "who actually loves my sister

1132
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,860
 "and married me by accident."

1133
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,460
 Right, that's not what she dreamt of.

1134
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,700
 But that's what happened.

1135
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,660
 But God's bigger than that,

1136
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,860
 because do you know that all those people

1137
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,700
 I just told you about, you know,

1138
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,260
 they're all kind of spread out throughout the Old Testament,

1139
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,860
 and then they all show up in the same place

1140
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,700
 in the New Testament, all in the same place,

1141
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,860
 on the same page in your Bible.

1142
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,180
 Can I read it to you before we end?

1143
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,780
 Let me just read it to you, Matthew 1.

1144
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,900
 A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,

1145
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,060
 the son of David, the son of Abraham.

1146
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,020
 Abraham was the father of Isaac.

1147
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,140
 Isaac, the father of Jacob.

1148
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,780
 Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.

1149
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,180
 Judah, the father of Perez and Zerah,

1150
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,180
 whose mother was Tamar.

1151
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,660
 Perez, the father of Hezron.

1152
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,300
 Hezron, the father of Ram.

1153
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,180
 In verse five, Salmon, the father of Boaz,

1154
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,740
 whose mother was Rahab the prostitute.

1155
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,540
 Boaz, the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.

1156
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,260
 Obed, the father of Jesse.

1157
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,940
 And Jesse, the father of King David.

1158
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,340
 David was the father of Solomon,

1159
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,820
 whose mother had been Uriah's wife Bathsheba.

1160
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,100
 And Jacob, the father of Joseph.

1161
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,700
 Verse 16 now, the husband of Mary,

1162
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:20,900
 of whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ.

1163
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,100
 Don't hope in fantasy.

1164
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,340
 You hope in Jesus.

1165
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,700
 Your life is not about you.

1166
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,380
 Your singleness is not about you.

1167
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,980
 Your marriage is not about you.

1168
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,140
 Your dating is not about you.

1169
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,580
 Marriage is not for happiness.

1170
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,940
 Marriage is for holiness.

1171
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,100
 It is God conforming you to the image

1172
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,900
 and character of Christ.

1173
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,420
 Singleness is not for happiness.

1174
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,420
 It's for holiness.

1175
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,860
 You're here for that long.

1176
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:02,380
 Then you die, and then you're with God forever

1177
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,140
 and ever and ever and ever and ever,

1178
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,140
 and that's the truth.

1179
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,540
 And that's as simple as I can give it to you.

1180
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,660
 And so my wife, Monica, she is a great girl.

1181
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,740
 An amazing woman, an incredible wife.

1182
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,820
 She is a miserable savior.

1183
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:23,900
 And I'm a worst one.

1184
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,100
 Don't you see what God did there?

1185
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:31,100
 God took Rahab, the prostitute, and made her a princess.

1186
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:36,300
 God took Ruth, the widow, and made her a princess.

1187
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,860
 He took these whacked out guys and made them kings,

1188
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,260
 heirs to the kingdom.

1189
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,660
 That's what God did.

1190
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,380
 He put the king of kings, the Lord of lords,

1191
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,420
 in their lineage.

1192
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,660
 So Presley and Finley, the reality of it is,

1193
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,580
 is they're not pursuing some fantasy.

1194
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,700
 Presley and Finley are princesses,

1195
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,180
 not because of the prince charming that's going to come,

1196
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,260
 but because of the one who's come.

1197
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,380
 Because of the rescuer.

1198
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,100
 The one who came 2,013 years ago,

1199
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,700
 a baby born in a manger,

1200
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,660
 lived a sinless life for about 33 years,

1201
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,020
 and said, "Presley and Finley and Kelly

1202
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:16,740
 "and Jennifer and Sarah and Kim and Ashley

1203
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,780
 "and Michael and Scott and Kenny and David and John,

1204
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,160
 "I'm here to rescue you.

1205
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,800
 "All that junk you've done,

1206
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,420
 "that thing you did with that guy you swore you'd never do,

1207
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,820
 "that thing you looked at,

1208
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,800
 "that abortion,

1209
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,880
 "that thing you did by yourself,

1210
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,220
 "like I'm here and I'm dying for it.

1211
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,360
 "And your little life, your little 60 years,

1212
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,940
 "your little 50 years, 80 years, it's about me.

1213
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,500
 "You pursue me, okay?

1214
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,140
 "You pursue me, and I'll take care of that other stuff."

1215
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,980
 You trust in the Lord with all your heart,

1216
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,220
 and you don't lean on your own understandings,

1217
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,940
 but in everything, you acknowledge Him.

1218
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,560
 And I'll say your pastorate, I got you.

1219
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,760
 God says He's got you.

1220
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,360
 He's good and you can trust Him.

1221
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,940
 He's good and you can trust Him.

1222
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,920
 You don't have to wanna play house, okay?

1223
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,240
 You can play servant of the Most High God, all right?

1224
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,480
 You hope in Him, hope in Christ.

1225
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,320
 Let me pray.

1226
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,960
 God, you are holy

1227
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,240
 and mighty

1228
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,720
 and good.

1229
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,040
 Father, you save us in spite of us.

1230
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,180
 Father, you change us, kicking and screaming.

1231
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,800
 Lord, I pray that you would take those of us

1232
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,440
 who are wrestling with your word

1233
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,480
 and we're looking like, how could God want that from me?

1234
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,000
 And I pray that you would renew it in our spirit.

1235
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,760
 Anything that I said, Father, tonight,

1236
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,160
 that was not of you, I pray that it would be forgotten

1237
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,800
 before they leave here, as I pray often.

1238
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,160
 But anything that I said that is consistent

1239
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,800
 with your spirit and consistent with the truth

1240
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,120
 of your scriptures, Father, I pray that you would stir it

1241
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,400
 in our hearts and our minds so that we can't forget it,

1242
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,460
 we can't shake it.

1243
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:23,320
 Lord, thank you for the work that you do.

1244
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,140
 It's in Christ's name, amen.

1245
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,300
 (silence)

1246
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,460
 (silence)

1247
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:39,460
