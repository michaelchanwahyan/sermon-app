1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,920
 - All right, well hey, welcome to everybody

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,360
 that is tuning in online.

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,200
 We're so glad that you're here.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,840
 We're continuing the series therapy

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,520
 where every single week we are going through a new session,

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,440
 if you will, for therapy sessions

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,280
 and covering some key issues related to mental health,

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
 which is an issue facing our world right now

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,560
 as much as it ever has before.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,440
 And really it was an issue even before COVID

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,200
 and COVID-19 has certainly not made things any better.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,160
 So we are covering for the next handful of weeks

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
 what it looks like biblically

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,080
 and what God has to say about mental health.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,440
 We're spending the first few weeks on anxiety.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,920
 It's just too big of a topic, too big of an issue

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
 to do all in one week.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,960
 So this is the third week as we walk through

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,320
 covering therapy and therapy session

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,960
 and third session as it relates to anxiety.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,640
 Let me start with a story that will give us some handholds

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,680
 for where we're going.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,400
 About 11 years ago, I moved to Dallas

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,120
 and I came on staff at Watermark

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,920
 and I moved into the back house of a family

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,040
 that were Watermark members.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,880
 And they basically said,

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,280
 "Hey, we have a place that you can stay and live."

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,200
 And it's like free rent, I'm always down with that.

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,600
 And I was single and so I moved into their back house.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,760
 I got here in June, but I wasn't starting work until August.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,440
 And I had about a month where I was kind of looking

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,360
 for anything that could be a side job

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,760
 or something to make some money on the side.

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,640
 And I had a relationship with a manager at a restaurant.

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,580
 So I reached out, said,

38
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,120
 "Hey, I don't know if you guys are hiring.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,760
 I only have about a month, but would love to work there.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,120
 We're looking for something to do for work."

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,440
 And he said, "Sure, we'll hire you."

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,640
 Got hired to be a waiter for a month.

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
 Now I'd never been a waiter before

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,280
 and had never really stepped into all the challenges

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,120
 that come with waiting.

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,260
 If you have, it's not as easy often

47
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,100
 as they make it look.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,960
 You're juggling tables,

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,400
 you're juggling all these different orders.

50
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,640
 And on top of that, there was always the challenge

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,360
 or the challenge that I never mastered

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,320
 of carrying drinks on a tray.

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
 It looks incredibly easy when they're walking,

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
 holding like 12 drinks on a tray.

55
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,820
 Don't be deceived.

56
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,960
 It's actually incredibly challenging

57
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,920
 'cause you gotta have all the right calculations

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,380
 with your hand and gravity as it work.

59
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,400
 And if you're handing off drinks,

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,240
 you gotta compensate to make sure that they don't.

61
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,840
 But anyways, I, because I never mastered that,

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,660
 during that month, I just decided

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,020
 I'm not ever gonna get this down.

64
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,700
 So I'm just gonna carry them straight on a tray.

65
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,100
 So it looked like when I would deliver drinks to a table

66
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,120
 that I was waiting on,

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,220
 I was just walking through the lunch line,

68
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,540
 you know, holding my tray

69
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,700
 and then it set it on the table

70
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
 and then hand out all the drinks.

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,260
 That is to say, I did that every time,

72
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,700
 except for the first time and first table that I waited.

73
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,720
 I'd gone through the training.

74
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,060
 I wouldn't a trainee anymore,

75
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,740
 where I was, you know, formerly the guy

76
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,960
 that you're just walking around

77
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,700
 kind of shadowing some other waiter.

78
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
 You probably have seen this before when you go out to eat.

79
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,580
 And it's like, hey, take your order.

80
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,420
 And this is Bob.

81
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,820
 He's gonna stand awkwardly close to me

82
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,720
 and, you know, learn how to do this.

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,700
 I had gone through that, was no longer a trainee.

84
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,860
 Got my first table.

85
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,780
 I go to the table.

86
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,180
 It's a bunch of men that I see.

87
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,540
 Oh, that's gonna be my first table.

88
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,620
 And not just any men.

89
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,440
 These are young dudes, all ripped up,

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,480
 wearing tall tees, tatted up.

91
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,940
 Just didn't look like a group of guys

92
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,300
 I didn't wanna get in a scuffle with.

93
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,980
 So anyways, I go up to the table,

94
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,780
 begin to take their order, get all of their drink orders.

95
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,500
 And I go back, pick up, you know, the lunch tray.

96
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,980
 And I decided, I think I got this.

97
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
 I'm gonna give it a go

98
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,260
 and try to hold it like a normal waiter.

99
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,460
 So I take their drinks.

100
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,540
 I carry it up to the table.

101
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,180
 So far, so good.

102
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,900
 And I begin to pass out to these eight men their drinks.

103
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,020
 And as I take the first drink off of the tray,

104
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,360
 I was reminded or I became aware

105
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,060
 that gravity definitely plays an issue in this whole thing.

106
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,740
 And because I took it off of the tray

107
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,500
 and began to hand it down,

108
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,540
 I lost control where it, you know,

109
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,160
 there was once weight on the tray, if you will,

110
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,340
 and it lost control of it.

111
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,420
 And all of the drinks came crashing down

112
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,460
 immediately on to the table.

113
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,980
 I mean, every single drink that was there,

114
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,540
 they just crashed immediately on this table.

115
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,620
 And there was one guy in particular

116
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,440
 who's wearing an all white tall tee

117
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,300
 that I might as well have just taken a raspberry iced tea

118
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,700
 and poured it right on his head.

119
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,060
 'Cause that's essentially what happened.

120
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
 He stands up, he's got raspberry iced tea

121
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,080
 all over his white shirt,

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,500
 begins yelling at the manager, yelling at me,

123
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,940
 yelling at what could have possibly happened,

124
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,540
 saying, "This better be a free meal."

125
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,780
 And the manager, or he's just going, you know, berserk.

126
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,860
 And I'm like, "Oh my gosh,

127
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,660
 this guy is gonna kill me for sure.

128
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,580
 This is not a guy I wanna get in a fight with."

129
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,940
 Manager comes up, says, "Hey, just, we'll take care of it.

130
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,860
 Go to the back."

131
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,740
 I go to the back.

132
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,660
 They end up sending somebody else to the table.

133
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,780
 They comp his meal.

134
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,220
 I'm sitting in the back thinking I'm gonna get fired

135
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,800
 and I'm gonna get killed in the parking lot.

136
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,480
 And it's just not going how I wanted it to go.

137
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,540
 Just panicked, heart racing.

138
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,800
 And somebody comes up to me and says,

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,900
 "Hey, your parents are here."

140
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,520
 And I'm sitting in the back,

141
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,340
 just kind of waiting to hear what's gonna happen.

142
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,400
 And my parents are here?

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,580
 And I think, what?

144
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
 My parents have been divorced

145
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,100
 for like 20 years at this point.

146
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,100
 So I'm like, "Our parents are here.

147
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,860
 They're having a meal together and they're in Dallas.

148
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,940
 You know, they live in Houston.

149
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,900
 That's just bizarre."

150
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,260
 And I'm like, "It can't be my parents."

151
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,060
 They're like, "Yeah, I think they're your parents."

152
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,300
 She points to them.

153
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,580
 And I realize it's the mom and dad,

154
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,520
 or the couple from that back house

155
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,380
 I had just moved into three days before.

156
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,580
 And I go up to them and they're like,

157
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,460
 "Yeah, we came to see you.

158
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,300
 It's your first night.

159
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,140
 How's it going?"

160
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,260
 And I bend down and squatting right next to them.

161
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,060
 And I begin to explain,

162
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,140
 "It's not going good."

163
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,780
 And I begin to go into,

164
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,700
 I'm a first table over there,

165
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,140
 addicted guy with a raspberry iced tea.

166
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,180
 Think I'm gonna lose my life, probably my job.

167
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,600
 And I'm beginning to like talk with them.

168
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
 And I'm just kind of like,

169
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,860
 "You know that moment where your heart is racing

170
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,780
 and you're like, I don't know what I feel right now."

171
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,180
 And I'm talking to them.

172
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,220
 And as I'm bent over,

173
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,240
 just kind of squat with one arm around each of them,

174
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,460
 very intimately,

175
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,260
 this couple that I had just recently met,

176
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,780
 somebody comes over and taps my shoulder,

177
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,620
 staff and is like,

178
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,060
 "Hey, the manager wants to see you in the back."

179
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,380
 And I'm like, "Oh my gosh, this is it.

180
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,620
 It's over for me."

181
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,380
 And I did something next that,

182
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,620
 to this day I've never done anything like it,

183
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,460
 especially with someone that I barely knew.

184
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,700
 And it was, here's what I did.

185
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,580
 Basically I was like, "All right, I gotta go."

186
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,620
 And I hugged the dad and hugged the mom

187
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,880
 and I leaned over and I kissed her.

188
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,060
 And it was like, as I got up and began to walk away,

189
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,940
 I realized what, I just kissed this woman.

190
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,980
 I barely even know.

191
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,760
 And I, all of a sudden was like, what just happened?

192
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,780
 To this day, what's probably funnier is like,

193
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,220
 I love this family and know them really well.

194
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,420
 And I don't think we've ever talked about it

195
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,060
 since that moment happened.

196
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,980
 And it just was one of those moments

197
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,300
 where in the pressure and the chaos

198
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,340
 and everything that's happening,

199
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,700
 I can't believe that all just happened.

200
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,020
 You know, I just acted out in a way that I'm like,

201
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,940
 "What did I just even do?"

202
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,900
 Now, what does that have to do with anxiety?

203
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,620
 I think a lot of times in life, you know,

204
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,340
 life is a picture of the chaos in that moment

205
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,460
 and the stress in that moment,

206
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,960
 the pressure that people feel.

207
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,900
 And in that pressure, we often do things that we're like,

208
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,860
 "What did I just do?

209
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,060
 Why did I say that?

210
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,540
 Why did I react that way?"

211
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,700
 Oftentimes maybe we're feeling stress and anxiety

212
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,580
 and it leads us to turn to anything

213
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,660
 that will give us relief because of that pressure.

214
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,620
 We're trying to find any sense of calm

215
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,260
 in the midst of the chaos around us.

216
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,380
 So we turn to different substances

217
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,400
 or different codependent relationships.

218
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,300
 People turn to pornography, people turn to alcohol.

219
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,580
 We just turn to anything that can kind of like steady,

220
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,300
 bring some sense of calm.

221
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,160
 The problem is a lot of the solutions we turn to

222
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
 are not helpful.

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,620
 They don't bring more calm into our life.

224
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,940
 At best, they're a band-aid.

225
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,520
 And oftentimes they bring even more problems,

226
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
 more addictions, more challenges.

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,380
 But God wants us to experience a life on this earth

228
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,920
 that is chaotic as it can seem,

229
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,100
 is marked by peace, not by anxiety,

230
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,140
 is marked by calm, not by chaos.

231
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,540
 So we're journeying through these few weeks

232
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
 and covering anxiety.

233
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,580
 And tonight I wanna look at another principle

234
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,360
 and practical thing that God says

235
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,620
 in the midst of the chaos of life,

236
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,500
 in the midst of stress, in the midst of anxiety,

237
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,740
 here's what I want you to do.

238
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,700
 We're gonna specifically be in Philippians 4.

239
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,740
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.

240
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,620
 And we're gonna read some verses

241
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,740
 that if you grew up in church, you may be familiar with,

242
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,700
 which is honestly not a thing

243
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,780
 that could be working in your advantage, if you will.

244
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,980
 Because you've read these verses before,

245
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
 and you're like, oh yeah, I've heard it.

246
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,820
 That doesn't really apply.

247
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,420
 It doesn't really help.

248
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,520
 I still have anxiety.

249
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,020
 And I would submit or suggest

250
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,060
 that could be something related to what Paul says,

251
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,620
 or something about God that you don't know.

252
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,440
 You're not applying.

253
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,060
 And that's why you're experiencing chaos, not calm,

254
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,620
 panic, not peace.

255
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,140
 And so we're gonna walk through exactly

256
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,260
 what the apostle Paul says.

257
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,700
 He starts in Philippians 4, verse six,

258
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,260
 as Paul launches into a conversation about anxiety

259
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,740
 and what Christians ought to do.

260
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
 Here's what he says.

261
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,380
 Do not be anxious about anything,

262
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,580
 but in everything by prayer

263
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,980
 and supplication with thanksgiving,

264
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,660
 let your requests be made known to God.

265
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,020
 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

266
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,100
 will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

267
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,020
 So Paul says, don't be anxious.

268
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,740
 Remember the biblical definition of being anxious

269
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,260
 is meditating or dwelling on fearful and anxious thoughts.

270
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,060
 It's not, hey, don't have an anxious thought.

271
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,340
 That's impossible.

272
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,660
 It is don't dwell or meditate on fearful, anxious thoughts.

273
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,180
 Don't spend your life meditating on those things.

274
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,900
 But instead, Paul says, pray.

275
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,980
 And he walks through a handful of other different things

276
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,340
 that are there.

277
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,360
 The first thing I wanna talk about

278
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,920
 is communicating your fears to God.

279
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,900
 Paul says, when you're anxious,

280
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,060
 the first thing you should do

281
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,060
 is communicate your fears to God.

282
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
 It's like this.

283
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,960
 There's a time in life, whenever you get engaged

284
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,260
 or whenever you have a child,

285
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,380
 there's something that you'll get to experience,

286
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,140
 which is an amazing part of being engaged

287
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,180
 or being pregnant and waiting to have a child.

288
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,260
 It's called the registry.

289
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,100
 What is the registry?

290
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,300
 It's your gift registry.

291
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,580
 Jesus said, it is better to give than receive,

292
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,420
 but it's also pretty great to receive some too.

293
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,600
 And the gift registry is where you let the world,

294
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,660
 your family, your friends, all of them know,

295
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,660
 here are the gifts that me and my fiancee

296
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,360
 would like you to get us.

297
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,420
 You choose the store, you choose the things that you want,

298
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,080
 and you, in the only time in your life, I think,

299
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,140
 where it is appropriate to make specific demands

300
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,020
 about the gifts that people are gonna give you

301
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,080
 and not come across as some entitled brat,

302
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
 this would be it.

303
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,420
 Because you could send it out and you're like, oh yeah,

304
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,740
 hey, don't worry about getting us something,

305
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,700
 but if you do, make sure it's one of these from this store.

306
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,580
 And it's what you do.

307
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,680
 And so you, if you get engaged someday,

308
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,260
 you're gonna go with that special someone,

309
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,100
 your fiancee, and you're gonna go to the store.

310
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,660
 And here's what I love about living in modern times

311
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,460
 is that they have added to this process,

312
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,600
 a laser gun to allow you to register for gifts.

313
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,540
 Maybe because they wanted the guy to be more engaged

314
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,340
 in the whole process, I don't know exactly, no.

315
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,140
 But you show up and they hand you a laser gun

316
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,740
 and you walk around Bed Bath & Beyond

317
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,900
 and you just shoot stuff.

318
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
 You're like, these are the cups we want,

319
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,060
 this is the comforter we want, this is the silverware,

320
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,340
 and this one's just for fun.

321
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,860
 And you just go around and you choose everything you want.

322
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,180
 And then you send it out to your friends.

323
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,460
 You say, hey, these are the things

324
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,220
 that we'd like to happen.

325
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,420
 Paul says, hey, when you're anxious, talk to God.

326
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,900
 Talk to God about the things that you want to happen.

327
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,720
 It's like, bring your gift registry, bring your registry,

328
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,380
 bring your requests to God

329
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,260
 and let him know about those things.

330
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,760
 So the first thing we see in this text over and over

331
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
 is communicate your fears to God,

332
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,940
 communicate what you're feeling, what you're facing

333
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,580
 in the midst of being anxious.

334
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,020
 Tell God what you're feeling.

335
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,820
 Now we read verses, or I read verses like this,

336
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,700
 I'm like, Paul, don't be anxious about anything,

337
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,480
 but pray, are you just saying, pray?

338
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,420
 And how can you tell me to not be anxious?

339
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,560
 Do you know how stressful my life is?

340
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,460
 Do you know how much I feel overwhelmed

341
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,620
 about the fact that this pandemic,

342
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,700
 it may not be going away for a while.

343
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,340
 I'm not exactly sure that I'm gonna have enough

344
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,740
 to make it through the rest of the year,

345
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,080
 that I'm gonna be able to continue affording rent

346
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,420
 once these supplement surplus paychecks run out.

347
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,620
 And you're telling me don't be anxious?

348
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,100
 Like, how can you even dare to say that?

349
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,520
 That's so invalidating.

350
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,240
 Paul's probably just sitting in some cabin

351
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,360
 writing this letter, all relaxed,

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
 just with not a care in the world,

353
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,360
 with some quill pen just in between his stream baths

354
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,640
 or showers that he takes.

355
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,680
 So he's totally removed from anything

356
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
 that's stressful in life.

357
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,680
 And it's not true.

358
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,080
 I mean, if anybody had a reason to be anxious, it's Paul.

359
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,520
 So when I say it's not true at all,

360
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,200
 if you think that, how can Paul,

361
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,440
 he clearly didn't know how stressful my life is.

362
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,960
 Paul had a life that is far more stressful

363
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,800
 than any of us have.

364
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,440
 If you could trade your problems with Paul's,

365
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,000
 you would not take that trade.

366
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
 Because what Paul was facing,

367
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,040
 even when he wrote these words,

368
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,560
 would have been incredibly anxiety provoking.

369
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,800
 He was sitting in a jail cell.

370
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,560
 He'd recently been arrested for sharing his faith,

371
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,120
 his Christian faith.

372
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,280
 And Paul was sentenced,

373
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360
 and he was sitting in a jail cell

374
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,320
 for spreading the message of Jesus,

375
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,120
 waiting to hear whether or not he would be executed.

376
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,200
 He eventually, after being arrested, would be executed.

377
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,940
 But right now he's just sitting in the jail cell.

378
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,500
 He's in his mid-60s.

379
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,400
 His eyesight is going bad.

380
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,360
 Jail cells at that time,

381
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,160
 we actually have writing about the jail cell

382
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,920
 that is believed to be the one Paul was in.

383
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,160
 And it said it was dark, it smelled bad,

384
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,080
 it was underground, it was separated.

385
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,000
 Luckily, or you were lucky if you had like a candle,

386
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 any ability to see.

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
 And in the midst of that darkness,

388
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,000
 the apostle Paul leans back against the wall,

389
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,080
 his body disheveled from tremendous hardship

390
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 that he had faced in life.

391
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,160
 Like, I don't know if you know this,

392
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,280
 like Paul was beaten multiple times with this,

393
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,880
 it's called a 39 lashes or a cat-of-nine-tails.

394
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,840
 Basically, it was this time they take these whips

395
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,960
 and they would rip and whip and whip people like Paul

396
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,420
 for spreading Christianity.

397
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,440
 And it scarred and disfigured his back.

398
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,520
 He'd been beaten with multiple rods.

399
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,680
 He was stoned, like people picking up stones

400
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,040
 to the point and throwing them at his body

401
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,360
 and to the point where he was left for dead.

402
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,000
 He just had this incredibly hard,

403
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,720
 difficult, challenging life.

404
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,160
 His body's now breaking down

405
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,400
 as he's sitting in his 60s in a jail cell,

406
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,520
 and he leans back against the wall.

407
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,160
 He feels the scars on his back from being whipped.

408
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,500
 And he decides to write,

409
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,460
 "Don't be anxious about anything.

410
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:18,100
 "But in everything, here's what you should do."

411
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,560
 If anybody has the credibility to write those words,

412
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
 it would be Paul.

413
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,280
 That's what I mean by,

414
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,640
 "Hey, if I could trade problems with Paul,

415
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,620
 "it wouldn't be like a mortgage

416
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,620
 "for sitting in a dark jail cell waiting to be executed."

417
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,800
 And yet this is the man who says,

418
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,900
 "Hey, you're a Christian.

419
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,740
 "Don't be anxious.

420
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,040
 "Don't dwell on fearful thoughts.

421
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,700
 "But here's what you should do.

422
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,640
 "Communicate your fears to God.

423
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,600
 "Communicate your fears to God.

424
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,740
 "Go to him in prayer.

425
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,080
 "Tell God what you're feeling.

426
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,280
 "Ask him for help."

427
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,860
 And then he says, "Not just in prayer, but in supplication."

428
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,440
 Supplication is a word that means to ask God for help.

429
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,080
 You can look it up online or look it in a dictionary.

430
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,980
 Just the word that Paul uses is, "Ask God for help."

431
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,280
 He says, "Don't be anxious about anything,

432
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,120
 "but here's what you should do.

433
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,800
 "Here's how you can trade panic for peace."

434
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,880
 And he walks through four things.

435
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,700
 The first one, "Communicate your fears to God."

436
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,480
 The second one, "Ask God for help."

437
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,000
 Say, "God, I'm afraid of being single.

438
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,680
 "For the rest of my life,

439
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,320
 "will you please help me to find a spouse this year?"

440
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,100
 "God, I'm anxious over whether or not

441
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,520
 "I'm gonna get this job that I applied for.

442
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,680
 "Will you please help me to not be anxious?

443
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,440
 "And please help me to get the job.

444
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,980
 "God, I'm anxious over my finances, please.

445
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,380
 "Will you help me to be able to pay off

446
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,180
 "the student loans that I have?

447
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,000
 "God, I'm anxious over my dad's health.

448
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
 "Will you please let the medicine to work?

449
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,860
 "Will you please help me to not be anxious?"

450
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,300
 Paul says, "Go to God, talk to God."

451
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,280
 So oftentimes as Christians, when we feel anxiety,

452
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,780
 it's like one of the last things we do

453
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
 is we turn to God in prayer.

454
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,860
 Like if I was sitting down with you,

455
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,820
 and I can say it after having sat down

456
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,180
 and been around hundreds and hundreds of young adults

457
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,980
 for the past 10 years,

458
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,780
 and those moments of anxiety,

459
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,460
 when I asked the question, "Have you prayed about this?

460
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,820
 "Are you often praying about this?"

461
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,720
 The answer is like, "No, but you know,

462
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,400
 "if something is important enough to worry about,

463
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,180
 "it's important enough to pray about."

464
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,020
 Go to God.

465
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,780
 And Paul says, "Talk to God."

466
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,500
 Prayer and supplication and let your requests,

467
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,940
 they're all like very similar language.

468
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,140
 And Paul says, "Go to God, go to God, go to God.

469
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,200
 "Ask him for help.

470
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,160
 "Tell him what you need.

471
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,940
 "Tell him what you feel.

472
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,220
 "Tell him what you're afraid of,

473
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,740
 "and then ask him for help."

474
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,800
 Peter says in 1 Peter 5, verse seven,

475
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,840
 "Cast all your anxieties on God,

476
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,700
 "because he cares for you."

477
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,600
 Peter says, "Bring everything that you care about to God,

478
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,140
 "because you are what God cares about."

479
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,580
 Anything that you care about, God cares about,

480
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,420
 because he cares about you.

481
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,240
 Think about that.

482
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,140
 Like Peter, it's a wordplay.

483
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,220
 Your translation has, "Cast all your cares on God,

484
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,580
 "'cause he cares for you."

485
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,260
 And Peter's saying, "Hey, you bring everything

486
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,320
 "you care about to God.

487
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
 "You tell him how you feel, tell him what you're afraid of.

488
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,280
 "Tell him what you're scared about.

489
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,380
 "Talk to him.

490
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,260
 "Bring all those cares,

491
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,220
 "because you are what God cares about."

492
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,520
 He says, "I want you to,

493
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,440
 "in those moments where you're anxious,

494
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,700
 "if you wanna step in the direction of peace,

495
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,640
 "if you wanna actually talk to someone

496
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,200
 "who can do something about it,

497
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,720
 "talk to God," Paul would say.

498
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,420
 Maybe the biggest takeaway

499
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,620
 that someone listening right now can have

500
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,060
 is just pray honest prayers.

501
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,940
 Like you would begin the habit

502
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,700
 of just telling God what you feel,

503
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,500
 not some spiritualized version of what you feel.

504
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,780
 Like so often, it's just weird.

505
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,180
 Christians do weird things, where when we pray,

506
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,580
 they downshift into like this mode of talking

507
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,700
 that's just bizarre.

508
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,200
 They don't talk like that to their friends,

509
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 but you see them praying, they're like,

510
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,300
 "Our Father, who in heaven give us this day,

511
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,160
 "and help us me to be of your man."

512
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,420
 And it's like, that's weird.

513
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,880
 What are you doing?

514
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,840
 It's not more spiritual.

515
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,660
 It's just less genuine and bizarre.

516
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,080
 You could tell God what you want.

517
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,240
 You tell God what you're afraid of.

518
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,920
 "God, I'm afraid that my mom's gonna die.

519
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,280
 "I'm afraid I'm gonna die alone.

520
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
 "I'm afraid that I'm gonna live my life

521
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,240
 "and not have enough, I'm gonna be a failure.

522
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,760
 "I'm afraid that I chose the wrong career."

523
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,940
 Talk to God about whatever it is.

524
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,800
 He loves you.

525
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,020
 You're what he cares about.

526
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,000
 Tell him what you care about.

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,800
 Tell him what you're afraid of.

528
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,640
 I've talked to young adults

529
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
 who literally have been like,

530
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,520
 I've heard this exact scenario

531
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,820
 where they're talking about their singleness

532
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,040
 and they're like, "Man, I'm afraid

533
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,120
 "I'm gonna be single for forever.

534
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,980
 "But I feel like I can't tell that to God

535
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,380
 "because if I do, then he'll be like,

536
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,080
 "I need to keep you single until you're content

537
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,720
 "and then you can have a spouse."

538
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,080
 So they end up being like,

539
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,300
 "God, I'm content, I'm so content, I'm so content.

540
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,760
 "I don't even really want a spouse, but I really do."

541
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,980
 And it's ridiculous.

542
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,700
 He knows you better than you know yourself.

543
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,020
 He knows everything you're afraid of.

544
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,860
 He knows everything you want.

545
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,260
 You're not hiding, maneuvering anything around

546
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,580
 in order to get him to do what you want.

547
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,380
 You can just say, "God, I want a spouse.

548
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,920
 "I need a job."

549
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,560
 Whatever they are, bring those things to God in prayer.

550
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,380
 My son is four years old and he will sometimes come

551
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,220
 into my room in the middle of the night.

552
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,540
 This actually happened last night.

553
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,920
 And he'll come in and he'll be like 3 a.m.

554
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,860
 He's like, "Daddy, there's monsters underneath my bed."

555
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,300
 And I try to resist saying,

556
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,680
 "Oh man, yes, I put them there

557
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,040
 "in order to keep you from getting out of bed."

558
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,480
 But really I hear him,

559
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,760
 of course I know there's not monsters

560
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,480
 or he'll say, "There's monsters in the closet."

561
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,960
 I pick him up, I take him back to his bed

562
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,000
 and I go underneath and I look and I'm like,

563
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "There's no monsters.

564
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,380
 "Got them all out of here.

565
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,580
 "Check in the closet.

566
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,080
 "No monsters in there.

567
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,960
 "We've got a big dog, Crew."

568
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,080
 It's his name.

569
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,020
 Crew is my son's name.

570
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,860
 "We have a big dog.

571
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,200
 "He wouldn't let any monsters in here.

572
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,400
 "All the monsters are gone."

573
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,100
 And I leave there.

574
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,200
 And there's something about me honestly

575
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,600
 that kind of loves the fact that he will come do that.

576
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,920
 Wake me up and ask me to come get the monsters out

577
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,160
 or tell me I'm afraid of the monsters

578
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,560
 and can I get the monsters out.

579
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,800
 And it's not because I love being woken up

580
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,640
 at three in the morning by a three foot silhouette

581
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,680
 of a small child like we're in "Children of the Corn."

582
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,400
 Has anyone seen "Children of the Corn?"

583
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,460
 Man, what a creepy movie.

584
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,200
 Anyways, it's not because I love that experience.

585
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,320
 It's because I love the fact that he knows

586
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,700
 if I'm afraid, I can go to my dad.

587
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,080
 My father cares about me

588
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,820
 and my dad can get the monsters out.

589
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,400
 Like he knows that in that moment when I'm afraid,

590
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,700
 I'm gonna go to my dad.

591
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,280
 I'm gonna go to my daddy because he cares about me

592
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,880
 and he can get the monsters out.

593
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,800
 How heartbreaking would it be

594
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,360
 if I as a father saw him or knew or thought

595
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,160
 that he was sitting in his bed and he was terrified

596
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
 but he was like, "I can't go to my dad.

597
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
 "My dad doesn't care about me.

598
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,880
 "He doesn't care that there's monsters."

599
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,040
 And even if he did,

600
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,440
 he doesn't have what it takes to beat those monsters?

601
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,640
 Be heartbreaking.

602
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,280
 Yet so often, that's exactly what we do to God.

603
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,960
 Like, I can't bring these things to God.

604
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,120
 I can't bring, like they're too small,

605
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,960
 they're too insignificant.

606
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,880
 He doesn't really care about me.

607
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,620
 I can't go and just ask him to help me have,

608
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,000
 you know, promotion at my job.

609
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,200
 I can't ask him to make the pandemic go away.

610
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,520
 I can't ask him to do whatever it is as though we think,

611
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,960
 or maybe Paul would say,

612
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,380
 I don't think you think God cares for you.

613
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,400
 Or maybe there's part of us that's like,

614
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,560
 oh no, he cares for me.

615
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,200
 I mean, he sent his son to die on the cross for me.

616
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,760
 The highest price he could pay, he paid it.

617
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,880
 Of course God cares about me.

618
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,940
 I just don't think he can do anything about it

619
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,600
 or he would do anything about it.

620
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,880
 And yet that's exactly what we do to God.

621
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,620
 We don't decide, hey, I'm gonna go to him.

622
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,640
 I'm bringing those things.

623
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,800
 He cares about me.

624
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,320
 He can do something about it.

625
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,720
 I'm bringing those to him.

626
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,040
 And God and Paul, through God's words says,

627
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,840
 bring your requests or bring, make those asks of God.

628
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,800
 Ask him for help in whatever you're facing.

629
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,560
 And then finally he says the third way of expressing

630
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
 kind of go to God, go to God.

631
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,920
 Let your request be made known to God.

632
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:33,160
 I love the way that Paul wrote this verse in verse six

633
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,840
 of let them be known because it's a passive voice.

634
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,480
 If you remember back to English class,

635
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,720
 when things would be in the active form and passive form

636
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,160
 or perfect tense form, this is in a passive form.

637
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,680
 In other words, it's not a direct command saying,

638
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,600
 hey, make your requests be known, it's passive.

639
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
 It's like, hey, let them be made known.

640
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,960
 It carries the idea that those anxieties,

641
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,480
 they want to lift up.

642
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,940
 They want to get out.

643
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,880
 When you feel them rising up inside of you,

644
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,620
 it's just, man, let them out

645
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,200
 through talking to God about them.

646
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,240
 Let them be made known.

647
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
 Don't hold onto them.

648
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,240
 Don't bury them inside.

649
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
 It's like this.

650
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,040
 Anxiety inside of all of our lives,

651
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,000
 you know, whatever type of anxiety that you feel.

652
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,760
 Paul says, man, let those things surface.

653
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,720
 Let them come out and let them surface.

654
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,000
 Most of the time we walk through life

655
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,420
 and instead of letting those things out,

656
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,600
 we just bury them down.

657
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,860
 We act like they're not there.

658
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,280
 So we go through and you know, if each one of these,

659
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,760
 this is almost how anxiety can work itself out in our life.

660
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
 There's one, so we're anxious about different things

661
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,440
 inside of life.

662
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
 It's like, man, I got my finances.

663
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,680
 I'm anxious about it and I don't want to be poor.

664
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,220
 I want to make sure I have enough in retirement

665
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,720
 and I'm feeling all these different things inside of me

666
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,960
 and I don't know how I'm going to pay for rent.

667
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
 And Paul says, just let it out.

668
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,080
 And too often we just hold onto it and carry it around

669
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,920
 and we're like, no, I can't.

670
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,720
 I'm trying to bury it down deeper and deeper and deeper

671
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,560
 in our life.

672
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,360
 And then we have other anxieties that we walk through life

673
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,960
 and it's like, oh man, my parents divorced.

674
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,680
 And Paul says, man, if you're anxious about it,

675
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
 like let it, talk to God.

676
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
 Let them out.

677
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,400
 Let them rise.

678
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,280
 Talk to God in prayer.

679
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,320
 And too often we just walk through and we're like, man,

680
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
 I'm just going to hold it.

681
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,280
 I got this one from Corona and people come around

682
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,960
 and we continue to stuff them down even deeper in our lives.

683
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,680
 And we go through life.

684
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,820
 And instead of letting these things that just boil up

685
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,720
 on the inside, we're like, man, I'm so anxious.

686
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,400
 Could possibly lose my job.

687
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
 I'm going to be single for forever.

688
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,840
 And Paul says, man, you're carrying around things

689
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,680
 you were never meant to carry.

690
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,240
 Let them rise out.

691
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,880
 And they begin to rise and we're just trying to hold on to

692
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,960
 them and walk through life and we stuff them down deeper.

693
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,800
 And before the day even hits and, oh no,

694
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,160
 financial prayer got away.

695
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,720
 And we just push them down and push them down.

696
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,360
 And Paul says, no, let them rise.

697
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,220
 Let them rise.

698
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,760
 Usually we walk through life and we pretend like

699
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,160
 they're not there.

700
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,040
 And they hit us like they flood us in the morning.

701
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,880
 Like, here's what I know.

702
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,700
 You're human.

703
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,320
 So today you woke up and even right now you're feeling

704
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,040
 a flood of loneliness, fear, anxiety, all types of emotions.

705
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,840
 Some you can articulate, some that you can't.

706
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,800
 And you feel those things.

707
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,600
 And instead of expressing them or talking to God about them,

708
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,280
 you stuff them down and you act like they're not there.

709
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,960
 So you go from one day to the next and you go see your

710
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,080
 friends and people walk through life.

711
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,920
 You're like, how are you doing?

712
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,760
 You're like, oh, I'm doing so great.

713
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,680
 Life is amazing.

714
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,520
 You know, it's cool.

715
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,340
 God's good.

716
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,180
 Not today, Satan.

717
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,440
 Blessed, hashtag blessed.

718
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,240
 And you hold onto them and you push them down and you push

719
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,520
 them down and you act like they're not there.

720
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,960
 And they're not going away.

721
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,920
 And Paul says, let them rise.

722
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,440
 Talk to God about them.

723
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,520
 He cares for you.

724
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,800
 You're who he cares about.

725
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,880
 Let them rise.

726
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,040
 Let them go.

727
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,080
 And he says, when you do, you will begin to step in the

728
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,160
 direction of peace.

729
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,160
 Go to God, go to God, talk to God about what you're feeling

730
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,320
 right now, tonight.

731
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,400
 And then he says,

732
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,840
 and the peace of God.

733
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,000
 (silence)

734
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,120
 Which surpasses understanding.

735
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,680
 As in, it's a peace that Paul sitting in that jail cell,

736
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,280
 circumstances that none of us would ever want in our life,

737
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,560
 was experiencing.

738
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,880
 And Paul's writing this letter and he's trying to figure

739
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,720
 like, how do I say it?

740
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,280
 Like this incredible peace.

741
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,560
 No matter what you're facing in life, like you can be

742
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,760
 chained to a Roman guard, which Paul would have been as he

743
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,160
 was writing.

744
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,440
 It's like, when you begin to do this, you experience a

745
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,400
 peace that, man, it's amazing peace.

746
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,880
 No, it's incredible peace.

747
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,160
 No, it's great peace.

748
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,760
 No, it's like, I can't even explain it, peace.

749
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,360
 It's peace of God.

750
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,280
 Comes into your heart and your life.

751
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,920
 And he says, it guards your hearts and your minds

752
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,800
 in Christ Jesus.

753
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
 The word guard just means like, it's like, it was a

754
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,880
 military term.

755
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,880
 City of Philippi, where this letter was written, was a

756
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,200
 military outpost.

757
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,600
 Be like Fort Bend, where they had a fort station there.

758
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,400
 They knew what it was like to have guards, people on guard,

759
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
 protecting something.

760
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,680
 And Paul says, just like those guards outside of the city

761
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,560
 wall that protect you guys in Philippi, that's what the

762
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,720
 peace of God will begin to do in your heart and your life.

763
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,600
 That no matter what you're facing, what you're walking

764
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,800
 through, what you're experiencing, it's protecting you.

765
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,680
 You're experiencing it.

766
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,920
 Not because life is perfect and looks amazing all the time.

767
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 No, no, no, no, no.

768
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,520
 Because no matter what you're facing on the outside,

769
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,880
 you're okay on the inside.

770
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,760
 Because when you're anxious, you're bringing those things

771
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,160
 to God.

772
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,140
 And because you know who your heavenly father is.

773
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,040
 Which brings us to the fourth point.

774
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,680
 So it's communicate your fears to God.

775
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
 Ask God for help.

776
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,960
 Let your request rise.

777
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,600
 Like let them tell him what you want.

778
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,520
 Tell him your desires, your requests.

779
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,160
 And then finally meditate on who your God is.

780
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,540
 Meditate on who God is.

781
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,120
 Because that's the answer ultimately,

782
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,120
 to how you and I can experience peace

783
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,560
 that he's talking about.

784
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,960
 Like it's like, Paul, wait a second.

785
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,920
 You're just saying to pray.

786
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,840
 And if I pray, then I'll experience the peace of God.

787
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,720
 Cause I've prayed before and I don't feel like I experienced

788
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,560
 the peace of God.

789
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,240
 Like how can I experience that type of peace?

790
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,960
 And Paul would say, as you grow in your relationship

791
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,600
 with God, here's what you're gonna begin to realize.

792
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,880
 As the more and more that you know who your heavenly father

793
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,480
 is, the more you focus on, and my God is for me.

794
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
 He loves me.

795
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,640
 He cares about what I care about.

796
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,240
 Cause I'm what he cares about.

797
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,360
 My God loves me and he's in control.

798
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,600
 Which means I can bring him my requests.

799
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,640
 And I can say, God, here's everything that I want.

800
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,840
 Here's everything I'm afraid of.

801
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,960
 Here's everything I'm feeling.

802
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,200
 Here's everything I'm walking through.

803
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,480
 And I can leave those with you, God.

804
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,040
 And the ones that you give me, awesome.

805
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
 The ones that you don't,

806
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,040
 it's not because you don't care about me.

807
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,800
 It's not because you're not capable.

808
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,680
 You can answer those things.

809
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,320
 It's because you know something I don't know.

810
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,600
 Every time that you bring those requests to God

811
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,720
 and he doesn't answer them the way that you wanted him to,

812
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,640
 Paul would say, you can trust him.

813
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,480
 He loves you.

814
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
 He gave his life for you.

815
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,020
 So anytime you bring those requests and he doesn't give you

816
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,560
 exactly what you want, it's not because he doesn't care.

817
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,360
 He already showed how much he cares.

818
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,440
 It's not because he couldn't or he's incapable.

819
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,280
 He's capable.

820
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,160
 He's God.

821
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,600
 It's 'cause he knows something you don't know

822
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,700
 and you can trust him.

823
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,260
 And as we do, we meditate on like, God loves me.

824
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,140
 He's in control.

825
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,280
 He's in control over whether or not my, you know,

826
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,120
 boss is gonna like the presentation.

827
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,320
 Like, God, you control people's hearts.

828
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,240
 I'm anxious right now.

829
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,120
 I'm asking for your help that it would go amazing.

830
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,160
 But if it doesn't, you have something better for me.

831
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,360
 And I trust you.

832
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
 You're at work in the midst of this.

833
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,640
 You know something I don't know.

834
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,280
 If I bomb the presentation, despite how hard I worked,

835
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,200
 if I don't meet the quota

836
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,760
 that I'm supposed to end up meeting here,

837
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
 and I'm asking you, God, would you help me?

838
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,480
 I've worked so hard to get this

839
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
 and I'm asking for your help.

840
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,780
 But if you don't do it, it's not because you don't care.

841
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,840
 It's 'cause you know something I don't know.

842
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,680
 So I'm trusting you.

843
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,040
 I'm asking this relationship to work out

844
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,180
 because we've been back and forth

845
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,200
 and it feels like it's on shaky ground.

846
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,440
 And I've thought we were gonna get engaged

847
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,840
 and now we're not even close to getting engaged.

848
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
 And I'm not even sure I can keep dating them.

849
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,420
 God, would you please help us to make it work?

850
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,840
 And I leave that there with you.

851
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,000
 If you don't answer it,

852
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,680
 or if you answer in the way that I don't want it to,

853
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,700
 we break up.

854
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,480
 It's not because you don't care.

855
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,640
 It's 'cause you know something I don't know.

856
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,620
 And I trust you.

857
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,120
 And I'm gonna choose to trust you.

858
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,720
 And Paul says, when you do that,

859
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,680
 you'll experience peace.

860
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,380
 You leave those things with him

861
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,400
 and you decide you love me, you're in control.

862
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,600
 If I ask you something, it doesn't happen.

863
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,960
 You know something I don't.

864
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,660
 I trust you.

865
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,600
 He says, you're gonna experience peace.

866
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,200
 I talked about the registry.

867
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,040
 Said just how awesome it is to have, you know,

868
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,280
 the ability to do one of those.

869
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,800
 But if you are engaged,

870
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,880
 here's something you should probably know

871
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,800
 is headed your way.

872
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,560
 You're gonna fill out that registry.

873
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,080
 You're gonna send it out to all your family and friends.

874
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,520
 And there's gonna be someone inevitably,

875
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,080
 I think there's one in every single family, at least one.

876
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,800
 And they get that registry from you and they decide,

877
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,080
 yeah, I'm not doing any of these.

878
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,280
 I'm going off the registry.

879
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,080
 And this is sometimes the person who's like,

880
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,680
 makes homemade gifts or like,

881
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,360
 sews together an Afghan blanket.

882
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,760
 You know, that's their gift to you,

883
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,640
 which if you don't know what an Afghan blanket is,

884
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,120
 it's like a really itchy blanket that is good for,

885
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,240
 you know, moving TVs when you move apartments.

886
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,960
 But they're the person who gives you that

887
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,800
 or they give you silverware

888
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,960
 that doesn't match your other silverware.

889
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,640
 They're like, here's some, you know, decorative pictures

890
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
 for inside your apartment.

891
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,360
 You're like, these match nothing that we have.

892
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,080
 These are going, you know, into storage or into the attic.

893
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,200
 They're just someone who goes off the registry

894
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,120
 and they do so really, I think,

895
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,120
 because they're just not great at giving gifts.

896
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,200
 It could be a lot of reasons why,

897
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,680
 but they just are not great at giving gifts.

898
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,600
 And so when it came to giving you what you asked for,

899
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,080
 it's, you know, 'cause they're a bad gift giver.

900
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,440
 Is that what God is like?

901
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,360
 Paul would say, no.

902
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,480
 God is an amazing gift giver.

903
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,640
 He only gives good things.

904
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,000
 In fact, Matthew chapter seven,

905
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
 Jesus says that exact thing.

906
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,360
 So what could be happening if God doesn't answer the quest

907
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,240
 or he goes off of my requested registry to him?

908
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,200
 There's also another type of person

909
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
 who goes off the registry.

910
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
 It's not the person who does so

911
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,400
 because they're bad at giving gifts.

912
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,640
 It's the person who does so

913
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,480
 because they're farther in life than you are.

914
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,080
 They've been married a little longer than you have.

915
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,040
 They've had children longer or maybe more than one child

916
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,960
 and they just know something about you

917
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,400
 that you don't quite know.

918
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,640
 You don't even know to ask for it.

919
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,040
 And so they're gonna go off the registry

920
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,200
 to get you something that they're like,

921
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,240
 look, hey, I'm telling you, you're gonna want this.

922
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,920
 You didn't even ask for it, but I'm getting it for you

923
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,840
 'cause I'm farther down.

924
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,200
 I know something that you don't.

925
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,160
 This happened in my own life.

926
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
 When we had our first son,

927
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,200
 we got in a, when we were pregnant, we had a baby shower.

928
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
 So you do the same thing with babies.

929
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,800
 Fill out, do a registry, send it to your friends.

930
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,920
 Like, these are the things we want.

931
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,880
 And we sent it out.

932
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 And at one of the showers,

933
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,720
 somebody came in and said,

934
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,400
 "Hey, I'm gonna give you a baby shower."

935
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,320
 And somebody came up and they'd given us a gift

936
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,880
 that was off the registry.

937
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,280
 And they brought us this bassinet.

938
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,000
 A bassinet is like a little crib that you put by the bed.

939
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,840
 And anyway, they've got us this bassinet

940
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,960
 and they're like, "Hey, we got you this."

941
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,480
 And they're like, "It wasn't on your registry,

942
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,640
 but you're gonna want this.

943
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,760
 This thing is a life changer.

944
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,120
 It's a miracle worker, way maker, miracle."

945
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,120
 They basically went through and, man, guys, come on, man.

946
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,840
 Somebody having fun in here.

947
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,160
 And they gave us this bassinet.

948
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,320
 And at the time we got it and we were like,

949
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,360
 "Oh, great.

950
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,080
 Why didn't you just get us some of the things

951
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,360
 that we asked for?

952
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,040
 Put this in the closet."

953
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,360
 And then six weeks later, when we had our,

954
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,720
 when our child, our son was six weeks old,

955
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,880
 we were in that stage where it's just like total,

956
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,480
 you'll do anything to stop the madness.

957
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,760
 You're like, he won't sleep.

958
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,200
 We're up all hours of the night.

959
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,280
 Please, please, God, please let him sleep.

960
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,160
 And you're trying anything.

961
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,880
 You know, you're rocking him.

962
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,680
 You're doing warm milk, cold milk, a little bit of drill,

963
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,360
 whatever you can to get him to sleep.

964
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,200
 And in that time, we were like,

965
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,920
 "Oh, man, we're gonna get that bassinet.

966
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,760
 We pulled it out.

967
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,600
 We're desperate.

968
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,440
 We'll try anything."

969
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,360
 Put him in the bassinet, put him down.

970
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,760
 And he went right to sleep.

971
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,880
 It was like, this is a game changer.

972
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,200
 I cannot believe that we've gone even the last six weeks

973
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,520
 without having used this thing.

974
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,480
 This thing that I didn't even know to ask for.

975
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,600
 But for whatever reason, they were right.

976
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,440
 I filled it out.

977
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,680
 I wouldn't even put that on my request

978
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,840
 of things I would want.

979
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,640
 But it's 'cause I didn't know what I didn't know.

980
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,320
 And because they were further down the road,

981
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,200
 they did know, "Hey, you don't even know to ask for this,

982
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,600
 but you're gonna want this."

983
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,920
 That's the description that Paul would say

984
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,360
 in the Bible presents of God.

985
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,200
 That over and over, he gives us the things that, man,

986
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,160
 if we were him, if we knew everything that he knows,

987
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,240
 we would ask and pray and make requests

988
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
 like the ones he's gonna give us.

989
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,320
 In fact, Tim Keller is a well-known pastor who says this.

990
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,200
 He says, "God will either give you everything

991
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,400
 or give us everything we ask for in prayer.

992
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,600
 Or he gives us what we would have asked for

993
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,800
 if we knew everything God knows."

994
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,800
 When he goes off the registry, he doesn't give a request.

995
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,480
 It's not because he doesn't care.

996
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,480
 It's because it's something he knows that we or you don't.

997
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,680
 And Paul says, "You can trust him.

998
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,400
 Bring those requests.

999
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,880
 And then know, as you know more and more of who God is,

1000
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,720
 you can trust him.

1001
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
 He loves you.

1002
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,520
 He's in control."

1003
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,120
 I said, in conclusion,

1004
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,080
 Paul invites us to experience calm and chaos

1005
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,240
 that we communicate our fears to God.

1006
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,720
 We ask God for help.

1007
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:14,120
 We let God know the things that we want.

1008
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,360
 And then we meditate on who our God is.

1009
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,280
 And when you do, in the midst of chaos,

1010
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,280
 Paul would say, "You'll experience calm.

1011
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
 That'll mark your life, guard your heart,

1012
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,840
 guard your mind, and step you in the direction of peace."

1013
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,040
 Whatever you're walking through right now,

1014
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,640
 and I know there's so many different things.

1015
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,440
 There are thousands of people who tune in every single week,

1016
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
 who download the podcast,

1017
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,840
 who are listening from every state in the country

1018
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,600
 and all over the world.

1019
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,920
 And what you're walking through is terrifying,

1020
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,680
 feels chaotic, and God is inviting you to talk to him.

1021
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,920
 If it's important enough to worry about,

1022
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,080
 it's important enough to pray about,

1023
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,360
 will you go to him in prayer?

1024
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
 Tell him what you're feeling, tell him what you're facing.

1025
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,600
 Ask him to move,

1026
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,200
 ask him to help you experience peace right now.

1027
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,920
 And know you have a good, loving, heavenly father

1028
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,680
 who cares for you, who's in control,

1029
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,520
 and has invited you to go to him.

1030
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,880
 If you're not someone who has ever put your trust in Jesus,

1031
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,700
 here's the final thing I would say to really everybody,

1032
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,800
 but particularly you.

1033
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,880
 What you need to know is that experiencing peace

1034
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,160
 beyond understanding or surpassing understanding

1035
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,840
 is not something you're gonna experience in this life

1036
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,440
 or the next because you've never trusted in Jesus.

1037
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,680
 You don't have a relationship with God

1038
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,040
 because the only way you can have a relationship with God,

1039
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
 the only way you can be forgiven

1040
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,840
 is not by being a good person,

1041
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
 it's not by listening to porch messages,

1042
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
 it's not by going to church,

1043
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,760
 it's by putting your faith in what Jesus did on the cross.

1044
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
 It's by trusting, that's what putting your faith means.

1045
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,080
 It means I'm trusting not in how good of a person I live

1046
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,740
 or how good of a life I live, how good of a person I am,

1047
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,520
 I'm trusting in what Jesus did on the cross.

1048
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,460
 When he died, he died for me.

1049
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,760
 On that cross, he paid for my sin.

1050
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,200
 He paid for everything that wrong I've ever done,

1051
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,480
 every sexual sin, he paid for that abortion,

1052
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,260
 he paid for every time that you've acted in a way

1053
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,920
 that doesn't align with God's word,

1054
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,000
 he paid for every time that you've had homosexual sin

1055
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,880
 mark your life.

1056
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,340
 Every time you've drank too much,

1057
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,060
 every time that you have dishonored him with your words,

1058
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,360
 every relationship that you messed up,

1059
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,240
 every person whose heart you took advantage,

1060
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,280
 all of it was paid for, all of it.

1061
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,960
 And he said, anyone who will accept,

1062
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,420
 not that they're good enough

1063
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,740
 to earn a relationship with God,

1064
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,640
 that's what, you know, I try to live a good life,

1065
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,080
 you're saying I could be good enough

1066
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,200
 to earn a relationship with God.

1067
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,900
 Anyone who says I'm willing to trust, not in what I do,

1068
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,540
 but in what Jesus did,

1069
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,280
 they will experience eternal life.

1070
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,280
 They will have peace with God.

1071
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,840
 And those are the ones that can have calm

1072
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,680
 in the midst of chaos around them,

1073
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,660
 in this life and in the next.

1074
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,080
 And tonight is your night.

1075
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,960
 And God extends to you, will you just acknowledge,

1076
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
 I'm a sinner, God, I'm unworthy of a relationship with you.

1077
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,160
 I accept what you did for me.

1078
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,500
 I'm sending your son, Jesus, as a payment for my sin.

1079
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,760
 And only by that I'm forgiven and I have eternal life.

1080
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,040
 And I wanna walk with you and live for you

1081
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,980
 for the rest of my days, amen.

1082
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,360
 You do that, your life will be marked by more peace.

1083
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,480
 And that's the first step you should take.

1084
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,440
 But for all of us, God says you can experience calm

1085
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,360
 in the chaos if you communicate whatever you're afraid of.

1086
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,400
 Ask me for help.

1087
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,360
 Let me know what you want, tell him your request,

1088
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,000
 and then know your father loves you.

1089
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,220
 He's good, he's in control.

1090
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,140
 And if he doesn't do things the way you thought he should,

1091
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,120
 it's just 'cause he knows something you don't.

1092
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,300
 Let me pray.

1093
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,080
 Father, thank you that you are a God

1094
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,160
 who's made clear you care for us.

1095
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,440
 And no one can actually believe that

1096
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,480
 based on what you did by sending your son.

1097
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,000
 You care so much for us that you gave your own life.

1098
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,480
 And so tonight, anyone who's never put their faith

1099
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,400
 in what you did on the cross,

1100
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
 would you penetrate and do what only you can do?

1101
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,720
 Penetrate their heart.

1102
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,280
 With the rest of us who have done that,

1103
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,080
 would we experience the therapeutic life

1104
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,320
 or experience of calling out to you,

1105
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,160
 communicating you in prayer?

1106
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,900
 When we find ourselves anxious, would we turn to you,

1107
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,080
 give you our requests,

1108
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,560
 and would you help us to be marked by a supernatural peace?

1109
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,540
 We love you, in Christ's name, amen.
