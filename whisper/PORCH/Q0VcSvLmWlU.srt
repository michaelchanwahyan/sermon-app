4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,800
 Well, tonight we're continuing a series called Skeptical.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,920
 If you're just joining us, we took a two week break.

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,280
 Ben Stewart, who was awesome, came and hung out.

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,160
 Yeah, whoops.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,120
 And we're continuing that series tonight.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,800
 I'm gonna give us a little traction by telling kind of a story that'll give

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,520
 indication where we're going.

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,280
 About a month ago, one of my neighbors asked if I would do him a favor when he

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
 was gone on vacation for eight days.

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,120
 And so I said, yeah, sure, what is it?

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,880
 And he said, will you watch my chickens?

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,040
 And chickens sit.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,840
 And so I don't really know what that entails.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,040
 Like, I grew up in a city, I didn't grow up on a farm, I've never been around a

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,600
 chicken before.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,680
 And so do you chicken walk?

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
 What do you do with a chicken?

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
 And he said, no, no, no.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,000
 All you gotta do is go over and let them out of the coop in the morning and feed

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,480
 them.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,840
 And then in the evening, put them back in the coop and feed them again and pick up

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,560
 the eggs.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,480
 And so this is easy, this is great.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,160
 And so he leaves and I'm over chicken sitting and taking care of these chickens.

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,560
 And a couple of days in, I decide, hey, I'm going to bring my dog over one night

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,360
 because the chickens are protected.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,560
 They're in this coop, fenced off area.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,160
 This is great.

32
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,400
 My dog's like enormous.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,440
 He's like 115 pounds and it was a terrible investment.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,680
 He's the investment that keeps on needing investment because he like eats remotes.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,960
 But anyway, so we need to get energy out of him.

36
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
 And so we brought him over there, I brought him over there, and I'm in the

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,760
 coop and I'm feeding the chickens and I'm setting the feet out.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,440
 And all of a sudden I hear a sound unlike anything I'd ever heard before.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,360
 And it was, "Ahh!

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,480
 Pika!

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
 And I'm in the coop.

42
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,240
 And so I leave the coop and I run outside.

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,560
 And behind the coop, my dog is sitting there with a chicken in his mouth.

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,800
 One of them had like escaped and so he's moving the chicken around and he's got

45
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,640
 her by the leg.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,960
 And so I go in panic mode.

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,680
 I throw the dog off of the chicken.

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,920
 I tie him up and I go over and see this chicken who there's no visible blood but

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,800
 she's like hobbling off on one leg.

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,160
 And I'm going, "Oh my gosh, I ruined the chicken."

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,400
 And it hits me like because I don't know chickens.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,320
 I don't know the emotional attachment you have to a chicken if you're the owner.

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,800
 Like is this a family pet?

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,720
 Does it have a name?

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,560
 Did I just ruin something?

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
 Should I call him?

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,520
 But what if it is like the pet and it ruins the vacation?

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,200
 What do I do here?

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
 So I'm thinking, "I'm sure this will be fine.

60
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,680
 Let's figure out what happened."

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,800
 So I take her leg and I see no wounds and I'm like feeling around for broken bones

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,440
 as though I would know what those feel like.

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,000
 And then I recognize there's a little cut on her foot.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,320
 And so my wife brings over hydrogen peroxide and we're like trying to nurse

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,560
 this little chicken because we don't know.

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,600
 Like is this a big deal?

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,120
 Not a big deal.

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,520
 And so it doesn't get any better and we just decide, "We'll just let her sleep

69
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,200
 this one off."

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,160
 And so we're going to give her her own little area.

71
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,800
 She'll sleep.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,680
 I'm sure she'll be great in the morning.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,240
 We go back the next day and don't bring the dog ever again.

74
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,240
 And the chicken hasn't moved and so it's just, "Well, I'm sure she's going to just

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,480
 sleep it off some more."

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,840
 And so we put her in our own little area, we give her some food and give her some

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
 water and we go back.

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,000
 And then the next day, and she still hasn't moved.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,960
 And so we're like confused on what's going on.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,920
 We're worried about this chicken, still haven't contacted the owner because not

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,160
 really sure what to do.

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,000
 And we go back that evening or I go back that evening.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,120
 And at some point between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., the chicken went to be

84
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,600
 with the Lord and it was no longer with us.

85
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,160
 And then again, we're going, it hits me, "What do I do with the body?

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,640
 Like, do I keep it for him to see?

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,040
 Do I throw it away?

88
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
 Do I bury it?

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,040
 Do I fry it and have it?

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,640
 Do I...

91
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
 We're like, "What do you do with this?"

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,360
 And then, "What am I...

93
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,040
 Should I call him?

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,800
 Should I try to find a replacement chicken?"

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,440
 I'm like Googling online, "White chickens, they're out there."

96
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,040
 And so this seems like a pretty easy deal.

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,280
 And it was very evident that what had been left behind in peace, in the normal life

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,880
 the chickens had experienced, had been totally destroyed and totally changed

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,480
 after the owner had left.

100
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,960
 What had been left behind and was originally there had been changed,

101
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
 altered, and destroyed.

102
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,280
 And the reason I tell you that, and this feels like a jerky chicken story to go

103
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,680
 into a Bible story, is that the most common attack, or one of the more common

104
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 attacks about the Bible, is that the Bible in its original form or the way that we

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,960
 have it right now, however it was originally left, has been changed,

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,280
 or it has been destroyed, or it has been corrupted.

107
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,400
 That the Bible is not trustworthy as it relates to how accurate it was from when

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,440
 it was originally given, whether mistakes were made, or whether errors occurred,

109
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,600
 or whether myths developed, how early did these people even live?

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,680
 Do what we have, is it accurate?

111
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,560
 And so for the next really 40 minutes or 30 minutes, we're going to dive into this

112
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,200
 subject of, can we trust the Bible?

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,840
 Is what we have what they have?

114
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,680
 Can we trust what's between the pages of the Bible?

115
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
 And so we're going to explore three little topics.

116
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,040
 We're going to explore the mistakes that were made, or the supposed changes that

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
 exist inside of the Bible.

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,080
 We're going to explore myth.

119
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,960
 Could it have been myth?

120
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,600
 Could it have been added in stories, in legends that kind of grew about Jesus

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,560
 afterwards?

122
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,280
 And then I'm going to give you really where I go and why I believe personally

123
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
 the Bible is trustworthy.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
 So first up is the mistakes.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,160
 Were there mistakes that were made?

126
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,560
 And you may be going, "Mistakes?

127
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
 How can this...this is perfect.

128
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,080
 How can there be a mistake made?"

129
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,680
 The way the Bible was written, specifically the New Testament,

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
 we're going to focus on that.

131
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,360
 We'll come back to the Old Testament at the end.

132
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,800
 Was the scribes were the names of the people who would take a copy of a book of

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
 Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, or John, and they would copy it out.

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,880
 There wasn't a Kinko's, there wasn't a copy machine.

135
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,840
 They would just write out, which I know is a big surprise, like, "What?

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,480
 Kinko's?"

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,720
 So the scribes would write out and they'd make different copies.

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,400
 And in that process, errors or differences occurred.

139
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
 And this may be news.

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,400
 You may have never heard about this.

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,640
 And so in the copying process of the thousands of manuscripts that we have

142
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,520
 from the ancient world, or from the first few centuries of the New Testament,

143
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,400
 errors occurred.

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,640
 And you may have heard this, you maybe have some professor who has said the

145
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,960
 Bible's had so many errors, who knows?

146
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,720
 We can't trust it.

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
 It's been translated so many different times.

148
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,160
 It's full of errors.

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,320
 Can we trust it?

150
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,280
 And the bad news is there are errors or differences in the original manuscripts.

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,040
 That when the scribes wrote, there were differences in each of their

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,280
 manuscripts, or in many of them.

153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,920
 And so that's the bad news.

154
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,920
 The good news is that the differences that exist, 99% of them fall into three

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,720
 categories.

156
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,000
 The first one is spelling errors, that they were spelling differences.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
 And so it's not like enormous things.

158
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,320
 It's like John, the name John is wanus in Greek.

159
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,880
 And sometimes it was spelled with two Ns, and sometimes it was spelled with one N.

160
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,640
 And so every time that it was spelled with one N or two Ns, there's a difference.

161
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,880
 And so that's a difference, that's an error.

162
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,560
 The second category, this is in the 99%, the second part of that 99% was word

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,000
 order.

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,200
 One of the common, I don't know, this is like fascinating stuff.

165
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,720
 It's like, there were changes.

166
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,640
 Oh, that's not really a change, that's a boring change.

167
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,520
 There were word order changes.

168
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,920
 One of the most common changes or errors you may hear people reference to, and this

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,320
 is what they're referring to, is word order.

170
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,640
 Because in Greek, word order works differently than it does in English.

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,240
 One of the most common ones is Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus.

172
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,160
 That some manuscripts read out, and as they're writing about it, they say Christ

173
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,560
 Jesus, and then someone said Jesus Christ.

174
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,280
 And so every time there's a difference, there's a variant, or what some people

175
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,320
 refer to as an error.

176
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,040
 The third category is the use of the article "the."

177
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,680
 And so in that 99%, you're going to hear people, maybe if you do some research,

178
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,240
 you'll hear people say there's thousands of errors, and 99% of those errors fall

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
 into these three, spelling errors, word order, or the use of the article "the."

180
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,160
 "The" is an article, and in Greek, you can use it any and all the time.

181
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,120
 When you read Greek, they have "the Jesus loved the John, they went to the pool,

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,200
 and the end."

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
 They have it everywhere that they go.

184
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,080
 "The," it's like continually used.

185
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,440
 So if someone said, "Jesus loved the John," or "the John loved Jesus," and they left

186
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,040
 out one, that's an error.

187
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,360
 So those make up 99% of the errors and the mistakes that exist.

188
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,720
 What about that 1%?

189
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,400
 In grad school, we had to study the 1% of the changes that actually have meaning.

190
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,840
 And you would think it would be so exciting, but I'm going to actually give you one of

191
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,640
 the more significant ones, and you can see how it's not as threatening or as

192
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
 exciting, even as you may even hope it would be.

193
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,320
 Here's one of the more common ones.

194
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,960
 1 Thessalonians 2, 7 says this.

195
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,760
 So we have some manuscripts that say this, "But we were gentle among you, like a

196
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,320
 nursing mother taking care of her own children."

197
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,720
 And then we found an earlier manuscript that said, "But we were infants among you,

198
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,400
 like a nursing mother taking care of her own children."

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,560
 The reason is the word for infant and gentle has one letter difference,

200
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,880
 napioi and apioi.

201
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,680
 And I promise this is going somewhere because it sounds like this is so boring.

202
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,800
 This is the substance of the New Testament errors or differences.

203
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,920
 All of them are as trivial as this.

204
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,360
 I remember sitting in class, studying and going, "Hey, where's like the big one?

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,880
 Where's the one that says Jesus died on a cross, and this one says he died in a

206
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
 camel accident?

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,280
 Where's the one that says he had 12 disciples, and this one says he had one

208
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
 named Pedro?

209
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
 Where are like those ones at?

210
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,440
 I don't want to know about infant or gentle.

211
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,320
 This is so boring.

212
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
 Where's like the...give us the big ones."

213
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,840
 And they don't exist.

214
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,640
 What you're seeing is one of the more trivial ones or one of the more hard ones

215
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,560
 that we have out there.

216
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
 And so what you and I can be confident in is that the New Testament that you and I

217
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,960
 have is accurate beyond 99% in the changes that are there.

218
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,360
 Everyone agrees on this next sentence.

219
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,760
 None of them affect one Christian belief or doctrine.

220
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,840
 None of them.

221
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,920
 That what you and I can rest assured in is that the mistakes or the differences that

222
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,120
 exist don't threaten anything we believe.

223
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,000
 They're all as trivial as that.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,840
 And because we have so many manuscripts, we're able to even see when that error

225
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,720
 happened.

226
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,560
 And so the reason this is important is because as you engage with people in the

227
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,400
 workplace, or maybe you have a family member or someone who goes, "Yeah, but the

228
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
 Bible's been translated so many times.

229
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,240
 I mean, we can't really know if it's true.

230
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
 It's been, you know, there's all these interpretations.

231
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,960
 We can't really know.

232
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,160
 It's been like the game telephone.

233
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,480
 It's been translated over and over and over again."

234
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,720
 You can respond.

235
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,360
 When your family friend or your crazy cousin comes up and has this idea,

236
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,680
 you can go, "Crazy cousin, do you know that the differences...I don't really like to use

237
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,640
 the word error, but the differences that do exist really don't make any difference

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
 at all.

239
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
 They don't change anything we believe.

240
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
 Yeah, there are some differences.

241
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,960
 Maybe scribes spelled John with two Ns and one of them spelled it with one.

242
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,440
 And that's fine.

243
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,600
 But do you know, crazy cousin, that the differences don't make a difference at all?

244
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,200
 So you and I can read confidently knowing that what you have is what they had.

245
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
 So what about the idea of myth?

246
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
 Couldn't these stories have been myth?

247
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,840
 I mean, you read ancient history and Caesar did all kinds of crazy things,

248
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,400
 like was half God and slayed a dragon.

249
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,960
 And we read it and we know that they're myth.

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,400
 Couldn't the idea of Jesus and his deity been a myth that really came along after he

251
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,600
 was alive?

252
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,160
 Couldn't that have been what developed...I mean, just like George Washington chopping

253
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,560
 down a cherry tree.

254
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,720
 I mean, this is like the Da Vinci Code, if you saw the Da Vinci Code,

255
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,960
 which is a fascinating book and movie, just not accurate, and it's fiction.

256
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 And in the Da Vinci Code, they lay out that the story of Jesus was radically changed and

257
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,440
 a myth began to develop.

258
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,120
 So couldn't it be or could it be a myth?

259
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,400
 No.

260
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,240
 Here's what we know about myth.

261
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,200
 And this is really historical stuff, so I'm going to do the best I can to make it

262
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,160
 clear.

263
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,640
 Myth, historians tell us, in fact, the leading historian on mythology from Oxford

264
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,520
 says that myth takes around 80 to 90 years at the shortest to develop.

265
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,960
 When it comes to the question of how long does a myth take, myth being something that's

266
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,560
 true to be kind of combined with something that's not really true, it had a little bit

267
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,400
 of truth and the story just kind of grew.

268
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,360
 He says it takes around at least 80 to 90 years because all of the eyewitnesses have

269
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,560
 to be dead.

270
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,960
 In other words, a story can't grow until everyone who was actually there dies off.

271
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,240
 The reason that is significant is because scholarship tells us that the story of Jesus

272
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:53,080
 and the writings of the New Testament all took place within 15 to 30 years after Jesus

273
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
 died.

274
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,120
 And you may be going, "Wait, how do we know that?"

275
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,280
 Here's one of the more significant ways that we know that.

276
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,240
 During 70 AD, there was an event that you have probably never heard about that took

277
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,560
 place in the city of Jerusalem.

278
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,920
 It's sitting in your Bible.

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,360
 You probably didn't study this in history, but in the modern era, this was the most significant

280
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,240
 date arguably for all Jews everywhere.

281
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
 Here's what happened.

282
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,400
 It was called the Jewish Wars.

283
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:27,280
 And this was a four-year war between the Jews in Jerusalem and Rome.

284
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,280
 Around 66, these kind of skirmishes and rebels who were Jewish said, "We don't want to be

285
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,400
 owned by Rome anymore.

286
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
 We're not going to have it.

287
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,760
 We're not paying taxes."

288
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,000
 And they began to gather supplies and they went into the city of Jerusalem.

289
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,540
 And they walled off the city of Jerusalem.

290
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,000
 And they basically said, "Hey, we're not going to be your slaves."

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,880
 Rome sent messengers over to the city and said, "Hey, we're going to take you all out

292
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,200
 if you don't open the gates."

293
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,920
 And they basically said, "Come and take it," Alamo style.

294
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,840
 And so Rome is now angry because you don't mess with Rome.

295
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,120
 And so Rome sends legions of soldiers over there.

296
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,320
 And for the next four years, there are skirmishes that take place outside of the city walls,

297
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,200
 but they were never able to break through the wall.

298
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:20,280
 In August of 70 AD, Rome broke into the city and they'd been sitting out for four years

299
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,160
 in the heat of Palestine.

300
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,720
 And they were angry.

301
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,880
 They were not happy.

302
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,560
 And so they go into the city.

303
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,800
 They slaughtered close to a million people.

304
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,280
 Josephus, who's a Jewish historian who was there at the time, references that they slaughtered

305
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 one million people, were also told that they crucified men and women outside the city until

306
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,120
 Judea ran out of wood.

307
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,760
 And then they started reusing it.

308
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,360
 And not only that, they destroyed the temple.

309
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
 The temple.

310
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,440
 Everywhere that Jesus walked around and taught in the whole city in the context of the center

311
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
 of Jewish life.

312
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
 I mean, this was a huge deal.

313
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,680
 Sacrifice was at the heart of the Jewish culture.

314
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,520
 And they destroyed, they set it on fire.

315
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,280
 They carried away all the loot back to Rome, declaring their victory.

316
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,640
 And ancient Judaism ceased and has ever since.

317
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,000
 Now this was about 35 years after Jesus was on the earth.

318
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
 And here's why that's significant.

319
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,520
 Here's why I tell you all that like bloody story.

320
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,080
 Because the New Testament, where many of these figures lived in Jerusalem or were around

321
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,600
 Jerusalem and Jesus was inside of that area, and Paul and James and all these guys who

322
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,960
 wrote most of the New Testament and the book of Acts, where it's always referencing Jerusalem,

323
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,640
 people going in and out.

324
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,280
 They don't mention any of it.

325
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
 This was a big deal.

326
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
 I mean, this was a huge deal.

327
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,920
 This was the day that everything changed for Israel.

328
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
 Everything.

329
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,920
 The context from which all of these men who were all Jewish little boys would have grown

330
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,480
 up was totally destroyed.

331
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:07,880
 And the only logical explanation, history and scholars say is it hadn't happened.

332
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
 It hadn't happened.

333
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,480
 That the writings of the New Testament had to have taken place before that or else they

334
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 would have mentioned it.

335
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
 How could you not?

336
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,840
 It was so huge inside of their history.

337
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,800
 I mean, in Acts, Paul's going to Jerusalem and coming back.

338
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,960
 There's councils that meet in there.

339
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,120
 How could you not mention this?

340
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,960
 It was so huge.

341
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,360
 And the only logical explanation would be it hadn't happened.

342
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,800
 In addition to that, if you were a perpetrator who is making up, you're not really John,

343
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,880
 but years later you're writing the book of John.

344
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,800
 How could you not mention this?

345
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,120
 How could you not leverage this to prove that Jesus was the guy and not say, hey, just as

346
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,520
 Jesus said, I'm the only sacrifice God accepts.

347
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,680
 He allowed the Romans to destroy the city.

348
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,440
 Just as Jesus said, the temple would be torn down.

349
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,080
 It was fulfilled, but it doesn't say any of that.

350
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,360
 And scholars look and they say the only logical explanation is it hadn't happened.

351
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:15,580
 All the writers had to have written before 65 or 66 AD.

352
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,960
 And the reason that's important is because that shoves the new Testament writings and

353
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,480
 do 20 to 30 years.

354
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,880
 Some of the writings of Paul are dated 15 to 30 years.

355
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,640
 And scholars remember, tell us it takes 80 to 90 years for a myth to develop.

356
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,440
 80 to 90.

357
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,000
 And the reason why that is significant is because the idea that the myth could have

358
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,800
 developed in that short time period would be almost like this.

359
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,960
 20 years ago, last month, something significant happened that led to a trial.

360
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,600
 Anyone know what it is?

361
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
 OJ Simpson.

362
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,120
 OJ Simpson trial 20 years ago.

363
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
 So that's 20 years.

364
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
 So just like the gap, hey, the writers in that 20 years, maybe the legend could have

365
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
 grown.

366
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,840
 No, because the eyewitnesses were around.

367
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
 Here's an example.

368
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,920
 OJ Simpson, regardless of whether you think he was innocent and the white glove and guilty

369
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,520
 and not, no one thinks Nicole came back alive or no one thinks, yeah, but OJ was really

370
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,100
 a superhero.

371
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,160
 No one thinks any of these myths, no one would believe them because everyone would go, no,

372
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 that's crazy.

373
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,280
 She didn't come back alive.

374
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,840
 Or no one would say she never really existed because it's too short of a timeframe.

375
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
 In this room we'd go, no, I saw the white Broncos on TV.

376
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,220
 We would know that it happened.

377
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,920
 And so the idea that the myth and legend could have grown in 20 years wouldn't make any sense

378
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:48,000
 because eyewitnesses were everywhere.

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,920
 The evidence for the idea of miss and really just for the writings of the new Testament

380
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,040
 is so significant that you have to do something because here's what that does.

381
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,920
 It shoves the writings back into the hands of the people who wrote them and into the

382
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,640
 short period of time after Jesus left the earth.

383
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:17,240
 And in college, I was a history major at Texas A&M, which, yeah, is a terrible major if you

384
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,480
 have children someday, because you spend four years and you develop no tangible trade where

385
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,080
 you can like offer the world anything.

386
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,640
 You just read a bunch of books and then you forget all of it.

387
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,960
 And so they kick you out and you're like, you got to go.

388
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,280
 And you're like, I don't have anything to go with.

389
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,440
 And so, uh, but there was one valuable lesson that I learned sitting in class one day with

390
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,560
 history and here's what it was.

391
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,600
 When it comes to history, you can't prove anything.

392
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 You may have never even heard this.

393
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,880
 When it comes to history, you can't prove something happened.

394
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,880
 You can only look at the evidence and conclude what is the most reasonable explanation.

395
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,040
 You can only look at what happened.

396
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
 The same thing in court.

397
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,800
 A court is judging something that happened in the past and they have to not prove anything,

398
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,720
 but look at what is the most reasonable explanation.

399
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,200
 And when it comes to the idea of Jesus and his movement and his followers and him dying

400
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,480
 and rising on a cross, the men who wrote these works, and it is proved that they were written

401
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,920
 within 15 to 30 years, the idea that it would be myth scholars would laugh at.

402
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,500
 And so then you got to go, well, maybe they were lying.

403
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,680
 Maybe they were lying as they went to their deaths for what they said they saw, not believed

404
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,560
 in like we talked a couple of weeks ago, what they said they saw.

405
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:43,560
 And that's a bigger leap of faith than to say, maybe it actually happened.

406
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,840
 And the idea of like myth and mistake, those are, are really two of the more common ones

407
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,640
 that people will bring up as it relates to the subject of the Bible.

408
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,400
 And can we trust it down front and really just as you engage out in the city, but those

409
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,120
 are never really the real reason.

410
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,760
 Cause the evidence, if you can look at it objectively presents such a strong case that

411
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,160
 you've got to do something with this man who showed up and changed the world, but it's

412
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,400
 never that.

413
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,560
 That's always a smoke screen.

414
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,920
 In other words, if you could prove, Hey, the mistakes, but you know, those mistakes weren't

415
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
 significant.

416
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,700
 They didn't make any difference at all.

417
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,960
 People generally aren't like, Oh my gosh, I want to pray to receive Christ right here,

418
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,760
 right now.

419
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,040
 It's a smoke screen.

420
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,280
 The problem is not that the Bible contradicts itself.

421
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,160
 It's that it contradicts them or it contradicts you and you can throw up smoke screens all

422
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:44,600
 day long, but the idea and the evidence behind the reliability of the new Testament is shocking.

423
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,760
 And every other ancient literature in history, historical ancient literature pales in comparison

424
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 to it.

425
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,440
 And so that's not the real reason.

426
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,320
 The real reason is you don't like what it says about homosexuality or the real reason

427
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,320
 is you don't like what it says about hell or you being a sinner or you having sex with

428
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,400
 your girlfriend or your girlfriend wanting to stop having sex because she thinks it's

429
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,680
 true and you're going, yeah, but what about the mistakes?

430
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,240
 How do we know like sex wasn't added later?

431
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,840
 It's true.

432
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,320
 It's always a smoke screen.

433
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,960
 I think that when I doubt, none of those are the reasons that when I doubt about the Bible

434
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,800
 being trustworthy and can it be trusted, it's not mistakes and it's not myths.

435
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 And honestly, when you get into like high level scholarship, all scholars would say,

436
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,960
 no, those are not legitimate on any side.

437
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,800
 Liberal and conservative would say, no, the myths thing can't be true.

438
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,200
 And the mistakes thing, that's what people say who just want to sleep with their girlfriend.

439
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,840
 Nobody says that, who actually has done the research.

440
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,720
 But when I doubt and I do as it relates to, are we crazy?

441
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,360
 I mean, when I read parts, honestly, of the Old Testament, some of the new, but just Adam

442
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,320
 and Eve running around naked in the garden and Jonah and the belly of a fish and people

443
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,960
 living to be a thousand, how did that happen?

444
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
 What do you even look like when you're a thousand?

445
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,360
 What do you look like past 200?

446
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,960
 You just turn into Yoda after that?

447
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,200
 How's that possible?

448
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,520
 Or Noah and the Ark?

449
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:37,280
 There's something I look at and it's a picture and it like reminds me of why I believe, not

450
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,880
 because I can explain Noah, but because something happened.

451
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,160
 And I'm going to show you the picture and you're going to be like less like, whoa, oh

452
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,760
 my gosh, I'm going to pray to receive Christ.

453
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:02,520
 But I'll explain why it means this picture is a cross in the emperor's seat in the Roman

454
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,160
 Coliseum.

455
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,560
 And the Coliseum is a place you can go to and you visit today in Rome.

456
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,340
 You'll see this if you go there.

457
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:21,320
 And the reason why that's like so powerful to me is because the irony, I mean, the Coliseum

458
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,480
 was a place where thousands of people were murdered.

459
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:32,720
 Thousands of Christians were eaten alive by wild animals where the empire tried to stomp

460
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:42,100
 out this growing movement where Rome's brutality and strength were displayed for all the world

461
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
 to see.

462
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:51,340
 And today in the emperor's seat where he would decide whether or not the fate of the person

463
00:25:51,340 --> 00:26:01,600
 in the arena would live, sits not a symbol of brutality, but of God's love for the world.

464
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 And it's not just that.

465
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,300
 I mean, think about like, this is why it's so powerful to me.

466
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:12,340
 And you're probably like, I guess if we could go back in time and we could speak to some

467
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,520
 of the men and women who lost their brother, like their actual brother, my brother became

468
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,820
 a Christian and he was thrown to lions.

469
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,260
 And we could say to some of the people who maybe they lost their parents who were killed

470
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,080
 in the arena or crucified outside the city walls.

471
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:39,060
 And you could say, I know it doesn't look like it, but in a few short years, the empire

472
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
 will fall.

473
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:47,260
 And where the emperor sits and looks out at the blood of martyrs dripping into the arena,

474
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:56,140
 there will sit a symbol, a cross, not a cross representing crucifixion or the strength of

475
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,980
 Rome, but a single cross representing a single crucifixion as a symbol of God's love for

476
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,980
 the world.

477
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,980
 They wouldn't believe it.

478
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,460
 They would not believe it of Jesus.

479
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,020
 Wait, who's Jesus?

480
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,180
 He's a guy from Nazareth.

481
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
 What is Nazareth?

482
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,300
 They could not believe it.

483
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,060
 If we would have told them then years from now, men and women will gather all over the

484
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,060
 world.

485
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,220
 We're telling these first century Romans and they're going, and what's going to happen?

486
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,300
 Well, they're going to gather and they're going to tell this story every winter time.

487
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,500
 They're going to sit around as a family and they're going to remember this story.

488
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,060
 And in the story is going to have Caesar Augustus.

489
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,860
 And they're going to go, yeah, of course, first emperor of Rome, but it won't be a story

490
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,100
 about Caesar.

491
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:48,600
 He will be a footnote in the story of Jesus, the man who changed the world.

492
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:59,120
 When I look back at history, when I look at the fact that we're here today in Rome, it

493
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,080
 is no longer the empire of Rome that has fallen, but now it would become over the centuries,

494
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,680
 the epicenter of Christianity itself.

495
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,800
 When I think about that, all of my doubts about Jonah and where they're dinosaurs, where

496
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
 are the dinosaurs?

497
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:21,920
 When I think about that, everything is brought back into focus because I can't explain that.

498
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,560
 And I can give, and there are answers out there.

499
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,240
 If you're wondering, yeah, but what about Jonah?

500
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
 There's answers.

501
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,600
 We give you books and links and sites.

502
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,880
 I can't explain that.

503
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 And it changed the course of human history because it changed the lives of everyone who

504
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,480
 saw Jesus and believed in him and trusted him in a top world, the empire.

505
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,440
 I am like kind of nerdy.

506
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,200
 And so I like to read the church fathers, church fathers are the guys who took the baton

507
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,320
 from the disciples.

508
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,160
 So Peter and John and James, they handed the baton off to what's called the church fathers.

509
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,760
 And these guys were the disciples of the disciples.

510
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,660
 Does that make sense?

511
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,000
 They were the ones who sat underneath the leadership.

512
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,280
 And the reason I like to read them is because it reminds me, oh my gosh, Matthew and Mark

513
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
 were real people.

514
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,400
 Like they, they're not just like, oh, and there was a guy named Mark and Matthew, but

515
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
 they're real.

516
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,380
 And in these church fathers, which are the writings of about 70 AD to about 110, 120,

517
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,720
 they not only record and reference the new Testament, they quote it and say, as the scripture

518
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,600
 in Matthew says, they not only do that a million times, a million times, they've referenced

519
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 the scriptures.

520
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,760
 They not only do that, but they write about their experiences with Paul and with Peter

521
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,480
 and with the other disciples.

522
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,240
 And it reminds me that these are real people.

523
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
 They write about, Hey, we, I was with Paul.

524
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,400
 We were traveling here and it's not in the Bible.

525
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,640
 This is external, extra biblical things.

526
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:59,400
 It reminds me that my faith is not rooted in a book or it's not written in a book alone.

527
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,840
 It's written in history and the anchor of my hope is not just a book.

528
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:14,980
 It is an event, the resurrection of a person, Jesus, the savior of the world.

529
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,960
 And that brings everything back into focus.

530
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,000
 And the old Testament, the reason I think the old Testament is trustworthy is not the

531
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,080
 historicity of it.

532
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,820
 Like it's been proven consistently to match up with what we know about history and not

533
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,120
 even the archeology of it.

534
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,520
 It's been proven to match up when they discover archeology and they dig for stuff.

535
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,600
 Oh yeah, this is what the Bible said.

536
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,000
 It's not even that.

537
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 It's because Jesus did because Jesus did when he was on this earth, he referenced and believed

538
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 in the old Testament.

539
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,160
 He indicated he thought it was inspired.

540
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,320
 He said he believed in Adam and Eve.

541
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,880
 He said he believed in Jonah and I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but if a guy can

542
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,920
 predict his own death and resurrection and pull it off, I just go with whatever he says.

543
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,680
 I'm in, right?

544
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,760
 And the reason we believe is not just simply because it's in the Bible.

545
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,920
 It was added the writings of these men who walked with Jesus and knew him and recorded

546
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
 it.

547
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,980
 Those writings were added later because they were trustworthy.

548
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,520
 That's why they were added to the Bible.

549
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,040
 And luckily for us, they were bound up so we could carry them around for him.

550
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,300
 But it's not just the Bible.

551
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:34,640
 It's because Matthew who left his wealth as a tax collector who hated religion and gave

552
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,080
 it all up and later wrote, I saw Jesus die.

553
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,720
 And then I saw him come back because Mark who wrote out, we believe mainly what Peter

554
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
 experienced.

555
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,680
 He wrote it out for Peter and spent time with Peter.

556
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,680
 He came to believe I saw, and I believe Jesus is my Messiah.

557
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,480
 He came back to life because Luke who said, I don't believe any of this stuff went around

558
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
 interviewing eyewitnesses.

559
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,920
 And at the end of his book, he says, I believe Jesus is my savior.

560
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,040
 He died and came back alive because John who was John.

561
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,640
 John was the guy who took care of Mary, the mother of Jesus.

562
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
 Who would you trust your mother to?

563
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
 That's who John was.

564
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
 He trusted Mary.

565
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,640
 Uh, he was trusted with Mary.

566
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
 John wrote my Messiah.

567
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,080
 I saw him die and he came back alive.

568
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,440
 Not just that Peter.

569
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,600
 Think about this Peter who was such a coward.

570
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,440
 Why would that even be included in there about him being a little coward to a middle school

571
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,880
 girl about whether or not he knew Jesus.

572
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,200
 And he said, Nope, never seen the guy.

573
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,640
 Peter swings around and becomes no longer Peter, the coward, but Peter, the martyr.

574
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,000
 After he looked into an empty tomb and he saw his resurrected savior, Paul, who hated

575
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,120
 Christians swings around and becomes the greatest missionary in the world.

576
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,440
 James, the brother of Jesus.

577
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
 Maybe you didn't know this.

578
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,880
 Jesus had a younger half brother named James actually had four of them.

579
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,960
 And James who for the longest time said, no, I don't believe it.

580
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
 And look, he's my brother.

581
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,600
 What would it take you to believe your brother was the son of God?

582
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,000
 He goes, no, I've seen the kid.

583
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,880
 We played Pete T-ball together.

584
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
 Not son of God.

585
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
 Great guy, but not necessarily.

586
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:19,600
 And then he comes around and says, my brother is my Messiah.

587
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,560
 And they all went to their deaths for what they said they saw.

588
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,400
 And all of their disciples who wrote about them.

589
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,640
 And we know it gives further evidence to the fact that all of this really took place.

590
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,440
 All of their disciples even went to their deaths for what?

591
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:48,400
 They'd seen and believed that others had seen.

592
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,720
 So the application tonight for believers in the room is not even really to do anything.

593
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,240
 It's just to know something that you're not crazy.

594
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,840
 And God has written his story, not just in a book, but in history.

595
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,560
 And it's anchored there.

596
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,840
 And you can have hope and you don't even have to be able to give a defense for Jonah, Peter

597
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
 says.

598
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,920
 You have to be able to give a defense for the reason you have hope, 1 Peter 3.15 says.

599
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,760
 And that's the resurrection.

600
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,240
 And the historical evidence is overwhelming.

601
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,920
 If you're skeptical and you're wrestling with something, we would love to talk to you about

602
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
 it.

603
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,240
 But you know whether you're hiding behind a smoke screen.

604
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,440
 You know.

605
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,520
 And you're just afraid.

606
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,120
 You're afraid that it might be true.

607
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,160
 That might mean you need to change.

608
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,280
 You might have to give something up.

609
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,400
 You're afraid of what that could even lead to, which is a tragedy because God, you have

610
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,800
 been sold a lie that God is here to rip you off and he's here to give you life.

611
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,880
 And he's anchored the reality of him and his love for you in history.

612
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,080
 Today there is a cross in the emperor seat and the Roman Coliseum.

613
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,100
 That is a display of that love that has changed the hearts in this room.

614
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,200
 The Bible has not been changed, but many in this room, our world and history have through

615
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,560
 the story, the power and the resurrection of Jesus.

616
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
 And you got to do something with it.

617
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,560
 The Bible is not just a book.

618
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,920
 It's way better than a book.

619
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,520
 And you can trust it.

620
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,360
 I'm going to pray and then we're going to close out.

621
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:42,720
 Father, I thank you for just how much you love us and that you have not just done something

622
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,960
 and written it down in a book, but you've displayed it perfectly in human history.

623
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,940
 You've written it on our hearts and you give us the reason for our hope that you not only

624
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,360
 have given us your word, which we can trust because of who wrote it and when it was written,

625
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:08,800
 but you gave us the living word, which is your son, Jesus, who was in the beginning

626
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,440
 with you and was God and has come to be among us and give himself for us.

627
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,040
 I pray that my friends who don't know that would know it tonight.

628
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
 We would trust in that.

629
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,060
 Pray that those who are seeking answers, that we would be a safe place to ask those.

630
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:29,660
 Father, we pray that you would change our city and that the irony of a cross in the

631
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:39,580
 emperor's seat in a Roman Coliseum and the power of the spirit that changed lives and

632
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:46,140
 made that a reality would overwhelm and overtake our city, our state, our nation, and our world.

633
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,640
 Amen.

634
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,140
 Amen.

635
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,640
 Amen.

636
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:57,640
