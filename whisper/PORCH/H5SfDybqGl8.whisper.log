[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:21.300]   - I love it.
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.100]   My family and I just got back from Disney World.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.160]   If we're Instagram buddies, you knew that.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.540]   I heard I over posted, I apologize.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.420]   And so we had an amazing time.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.600]   I've only been to Disney once before,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.040]   and that was with, I think I was 13 years old
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.480]   with a church youth group, believe it or not.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.460]   I don't know how that fits in my story for you,
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.700]   but I did go with church youth group once.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.260]   And Disney's an amazing place.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.700]   I mean, it's known for its excellence.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.740]   I mean, Walt was a genius.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.600]   It's 62,000 employees.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.580]   It makes us the largest employer in one location in America.
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.180]   It's 40 square miles.
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.060]   It's the size of San Francisco.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.220]   Disney World is.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.860]   And there's this entire world that you've never seen
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.900]   that makes it all possible.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.460]   It has these underground tunnels.
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.220]   It has a tunnel system under the magical kingdom.
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.260]   And because it was built on swamp lands,
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.780]   these tunnels were built first,
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.500]   and then the magical kingdom was built on top of them.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.260]   And this is where the employees go to and from.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.340]   In fact, in the tunnels,
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.540]   this is where their wardrobe is.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.660]   This is where they change.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.580]   You'll never see two of the same cast members
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.420]   above ground at the same location.
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.260]   It will never happen.
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.020]   Even though they have 162 Mickey costumes,
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.860]   only one will be above ground at one time.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.600]   I think I have a picture of the tunnels.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.140]   I don't know if you guys got that yet.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.980]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.780]   That's the tunnel system there at the magical kingdom,
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.660]   and you can kind of see it.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.140]   And I want to tell you something crazy.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.580]   You want to hear this?
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.740]   I've been in there.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.500]   And I don't mean because pastor privileges
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.600]   or anything crazy like that.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.520]   Let me tell you how it happened.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.980]   I was 13 years old,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.320]   and this is why I don't remember much of Disney.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.240]   We took a bus there,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.320]   and I remember I had been waiting in line.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.040]   It was hot, and I was at this restaurant at Disney
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.240]   in the parks, and I got this stomach cramp.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.800]   And guys, I mean, it was like a stomach cramp
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.600]   like from Satan, okay?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   Like I bent over, and I couldn't stand up.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.440]   It hurt so bad.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.760]   My stomach tightened up, and I'm with a buddy,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.520]   and I'm like, "You gotta go get help."
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.720]   And it was because I was dehydrated and a wuss, evidently.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.880]   And so here's what happened.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.720]   Here's what happened.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.960]   I'm sitting there, I'm in this restaurant.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.480]   I'm crying, okay?
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.920]   I'm embarrassed to tell you.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.800]   And I'm hurting, and all of the sudden,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.760]   these people come out of the woodworks like Disney ninjas.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.640]   I mean, just show up.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.720]   I'm talking, they like walk out of walls and stuff.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.920]   They're like, "Hey, do you need help?"
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.760]   And it was just like,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.040]   it was like people who I thought were tourists
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.560]   who were actually employees of Disney came to render aid,
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.040]   and they grabbed me, and they put me on a stretcher, okay?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   And they take me, and they take me down underground
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   into Disney's infirmary.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.960]   You can laugh.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   That's a true story, and I'm there,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.000]   and I spent like a day and a half
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.120]   in the infirmary in Disney World,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.040]   and I have very little memory
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.760]   of anything magical about the kingdom.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.720]   But this underground world exists,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.760]   and it's what makes the kingdom magical.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.400]   Like, you're talking 62,000 employees coming together,
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   working together for a common vision
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.720]   so that you can walk around
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.320]   and hardly ever even see a piece of litter on the ground
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.360]   and be impressed at every turn
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.160]   at how amazing the place is.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.560]   It's world-renowned for the excellence that it strives for.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.160]   And in the same way, God is building a kingdom,
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.920]   and we are the employees of that kingdom.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.960]   And when we stop working for that level of excellence
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.640]   that honors him, like Greg said, and motivates his people,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.920]   the kingdom withers.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.520]   And can I tell you something?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.120]   We've lost the kingdom.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.720]   And when I say we, I mean we, our generation,
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.320]   our peers on our time.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.280]   We just lost an entire country to pagan worship.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.760]   Like, for the first time in the history of America,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.200]   it is no longer a Christian nation.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.640]   For the first time in the history of our country,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.400]   we have diminished to less than half of the people
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.880]   who claim to be Protestant Christians.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.160]   There's an article in CNN today that said these things.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   I'll read to you some of the statistics.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   46%, that's down from 50% just a decade ago.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.320]   40% Christian.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   23% of our peers say they are spiritual but not religious,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.960]   known as the nones.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.280]   This is our generation.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.720]   It's millennials and Gen Y that this has happened.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   It didn't happen in our parents' generation.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.680]   It didn't happen in our grandparents' generation.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.040]   It happened on our time.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.840]   Why?
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.200]   Why, I told you before, I think we are poised
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.280]   for a great awakening or a revival,
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.160]   or we are about to slip off the cliff.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.400]   And you just have a choice.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.480]   It's like the Lord is looking at us,
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.320]   and I mean us, I mean the 2,000, 3,000 of us
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.520]   in the room right now, and he's saying,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.240]   "Hey, do you wanna get after it?
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.320]   "Like do you wanna start living on mission?
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.500]   "Or do you wanna raise your children
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.780]   "in a very different country than you grew up in?
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.280]   "And the choice is yours."
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.240]   Disney's an incredible place.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.080]   Here's what I've realized about Disney.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.880]   They have capitalized on the gospel.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.300]   Jimmy mentioned it in his spoken word.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.100]   What's the story that Disney tells over and over and over?
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.460]   There's a person, there's a curse
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.460]   that comes to the land because of evil,
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.620]   and then there's the prince that goes into the land
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.020]   to lift the curse.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.820]   And our princes, our princesses are sleeping.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.620]   And our princes are fine with the princess sleeping,
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.460]   the beauty sleeping.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.100]   Our princes are fine with Snow White
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.060]   being stuck with the seven dwarves.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.140]   Our princes are fine with Cinderella
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.900]   under the curse of her wicked stepmother.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.140]   Our princes are fine with Rapunzel stuck in the tower.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.600]   We don't wanna climb, we don't wanna fight.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.980]   We don't wanna do work.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.120]   We wanna rest, man.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.140]   Let us enjoy the kingdom.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.740]   Another party, let's have fun.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.700]   Let's enjoy life, make it about us.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.500]   And we've lost the magical kingdom.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.420]   It happened in our generation,
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.220]   unless we do something.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.940]   And I wanna show you tonight from Colossians chapter four
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.380]   that I believe God is calling us to do something.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.900]   That Paul is challenging you tonight
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.180]   through the word of God,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.820]   that we are to live our life on mission.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.660]   Paul wrote the letter of Colossians
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.740]   to the church in Colossae, it was modern day Turkey,
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.820]   while he was in prison in Rome in about 62 AD.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.060]   And he writes this to address a heresy that has crept in.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.780]   It's the gospel plus something else
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.220]   the Colossians began to believe in.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.820]   It's the same thing that your peers and your coworkers
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.740]   and your neighbors have begun to believe.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.660]   Yeah, Jesus is cool, but something else.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.980]   You know, all ways lead to God.
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.180]   There's something else out there.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.260]   This is the same problem that is going on here
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.420]   in the Colossian church,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.980]   and why this book that we're in is so relevant to us.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.460]   And so why have we lost our country to pagan worship?
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.980]   Because for faith, for many of us,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.740]   it's just a personal, private idea
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.500]   that has been reduced to simply focusing on
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.100]   meeting our individual needs.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.380]   And the church, a once very powerful movement,
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.940]   other-focused movement, is now full of consumers asking,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.060]   "What's in it for me?
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.660]   "How can I have a better life?
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.100]   "What can God do for me?
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.020]   "What is he going to do for me?"
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.980]   So what's the solution?
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.060]   I think we need to understand the mission that is before us
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.780]   to do this kingdom work that God has for us,
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.060]   not for salvation, but from it.
[00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.740]   Not to earn his favor, but because we have his favor.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.140]   We are the people underground,
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.460]   working as undercover agents, making it happen.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.100]   So that others see a kingdom that they're drawn to,
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.060]   and they wanna be part of that mission.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.620]   Tonight I'm gonna cover three things
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.100]   that people on mission have.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.300]   Three things that people who understand their purpose,
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.060]   living life on mission, three things they have.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.220]   Colossians 4, verse two.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.180]   Paul writes, "Devote yourselves to prayer."
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.500]   Oh man, let's just stop there for a minute.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.580]   Devote yourselves.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.780]   Let me ask you a question, what are you devoted to?
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.100]   Like I met you, or I know you,
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.620]   like we live in the same proximity,
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.460]   I get to see your life,
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.300]   and I'm writing down the things that you,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.060]   and I'm like, "Oh yeah, she really loves CrossFit,
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.060]   "and she likes North Park a lot, and she likes boys,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.580]   "and he really likes to work out,
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.540]   "and oh, you know what, he loves his job, okay?
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.180]   "And he wants to be a millionaire before he's 30."
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.020]   What are you devoted to?
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.260]   Because can I just tell you something,
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.020]   none of those things have eternal significance.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.860]   Not one of them will matter 100 years from now,
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.620]   not one of them, not a single one of them.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.620]   And Paul says, "Hey, you devote your life to prayer,
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.480]   "to talking to the one who controls all things,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.260]   "being watchful and thankful."
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.460]   There's a lot of debate around
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.740]   why this word watchful is here,
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.420]   and theologians kind of land in two places.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.860]   One is because it's something
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.180]   they call spiritual drowsiness,
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.580]   being watchful against spiritual drowsiness,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.180]   that you would be swept up in the world,
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.500]   that you would begin to live your life
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.740]   so focused on Dallas or Fort Worth,
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.340]   or wherever it is that you live,
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.220]   that you would forget the mission that you're on.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.020]   And so he says, "Be devoted to prayer, being watchful,
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:19.860]   "so that you would understand
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.100]   "there's real kingdom work to be done."
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.140]   Don't get swept up and so caught up
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.300]   in the culture around you that you wanna be part of it,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.740]   and you begin to invest your time, energy, emotions,
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.820]   and soul, and your mind into things
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.540]   that have no eternal significance whatsoever.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.060]   You've got to renew your mind around what matters.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.260]   And the other one is being watchful,
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.020]   because there's an enemy that hates you,
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.860]   and he's powerful.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.700]   He's not all powerful.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.460]   He's not nearly as powerful as God.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.480]   It's not dualism.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.580]   It's not these two forces that are opposing
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.460]   and of equal force.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.540]   No, no, no, there's God, and then there's the enemy.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.660]   But the enemy will jack with you, and he hates you.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.220]   And he wants to turn your life into something
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.480]   of no eternal significance whatsoever.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.540]   Like he wants you to get so caught up
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.660]   in money, and relationships, and pleasure,
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.740]   a temporary pleasure that is,
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.780]   that you do nothing with your life,
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.620]   that at the end of this,
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.400]   you don't hear mission accomplished.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.380]   You hear, "You know, you didn't even really
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.340]   "start the mission.
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.340]   "I mean, you know, okay, but you never really engaged.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.500]   "You kind of got caught up in Fort Worth.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.420]   "You kind of got caught up in Dallas.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.660]   "And you never really lived your purpose."
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.060]   Who wants to hear that?
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.840]   Now, don't say that to like put shame on you.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.940]   Listen, we are saved by grace through faith
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.860]   in Jesus Christ, his work alone, not ours.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.780]   But I'm afraid that our generation has forsaken
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.020]   the work that we have to do
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.300]   because of what he's done for us.
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.420]   That we can lose our life for his sake.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.860]   Being watchful and thankful.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.900]   And thankfulness is always in prayers.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.800]   You see that over, and over, and over.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.840]   And pray for us too that God may open a door
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.540]   for our message, this is Paul saying,
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.480]   so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.580]   for which I am in chains.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.420]   Now, this is interesting.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.340]   Paul says, "And pray for us too that God may open
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.180]   "a door to this prison so that I can escape."
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.140]   That's not what he said.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.880]   He said, "Hey, and pray for us too that God
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.980]   "would change our circumstances."
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.540]   No, no, that's not what he said.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.260]   He said, "And pray for us too that we would be
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.560]   "faithful in our circumstances, that God would open
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.500]   "a door for his message to move forward."
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.060]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.500]   Like Paul's concerned about things of eternal significance.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.660]   He's not like, "Hey, Lord, can you help me eat
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.500]   "and help me get out of prison?"
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.820]   He's like, "Father, use my life, pour it out
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.720]   "like a drink offering that the gospel may move forward."
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.540]   Gets it.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.420]   And pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I should.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.740]   Paul says a couple things here.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.420]   He says, "Give your life to prayer.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.820]   "Don't get swept away by the world or the enemy."
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.600]   He says, "Pray that doors open, not the prison door,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.860]   "but doors so that the gospel would advance."
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.740]   He says, "Pray that we would share the gospel with clarity."
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.860]   And so what Paul is doing here is he's showing us
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.620]   that people on mission have needs that matter.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.000]   That's my first point tonight, in fact.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.380]   What do people on mission have?
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.180]   People who get it, people who are building the kingdom.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.300]   People on mission have needs that matter,
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.380]   which is good news because we worship the one
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.120]   who can meet all our needs.
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.020]   We worship an all-powerful God who looks at you right now
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.140]   and is not upset with you.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.140]   He's not even disappointed in you.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.660]   He is thrilled in you.
[00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.500]   He delights in you, and he wants to do an incredible work
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.060]   through you, not by your effort, but his effort through you.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.340]   And he's like, "I love you so much.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.980]   "I've sent my son to die for you,
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.880]   "and I'm ready to wreck shop with you.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.920]   "Let's go.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.660]   "Let's lock arms and let's get after.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.600]   "Don't be distracted.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.940]   "Let's go."
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:03.860]   See, if we understood what our needs actually are
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.160]   and who can meet those needs,
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.120]   then I think we would be devoted in prayer.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.140]   We'd pray more.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.540]   Like, how can you believe in a God
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.540]   you don't actively talk to?
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.540]   How can you say, like, "Well, yeah, I believe in God.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.060]   "I mean, I talked to him last week sometime."
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.660]   How can you believe in an all-powerful God
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.140]   that he's given you complete access to?
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.100]   He's torn the veil through Jesus Christ.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.700]   The mediator has come between you so that you can talk to him
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.500]   and have a personal relationship with him,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.260]   and you say, "Yeah, I believe all of that.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.620]   "I just don't talk to him."
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.300]   See, needs that matter lead to prayers that matter,
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.960]   and that's what Paul is showing us here.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.580]   Needs that matter lead to prayer that matter.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.980]   Disney is expensive, man.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.880]   I don't know if you know that.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.100]   We stayed for a long time to go there,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.020]   and there's a lot of planning that takes place to get there.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.840]   Like, you pretty much have to graduate college
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.620]   with a degree in Disney to get in the park.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.700]   It's just a lot of stuff you've gotta know,
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.820]   and so I get there, and we get to the resort,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.460]   and we're there in the first night,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.140]   and it's like Monica and our three children
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.160]   are in this room, and I wake up at 2 a.m. to Weston crying,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.140]   and then Monica goes and gets up, 'cause I was sleeping,
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.300]   and she gets up to care for him,
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.440]   and then she comes in and wakes me up and says,
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.940]   "Hey, he has a fever," to which I'm like, "What, a fever?
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.880]   "This is night one of Disney.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.720]   "No way."
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.740]   I get up, check it, 103 temperature, night one.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.740]   I'm like, "Oh, no."
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.260]   Weston's our 2 1/2 year old, if you didn't know,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260]   and I'm thinking, I'm like mad at God,
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.840]   if I'm honest with you.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.900]   I'm like, "How could you do, like,
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.720]   "do you not know what I paid for this trip?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.540]   "Like, I mean, I didn't eat for a week, so that we could."
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.340]   No, and so here's the deal.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.540]   I prayed.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.740]   I'm like, "God, would you heal him?"
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.940]   I'm like, "Lord, would you heal him?"
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.780]   And he did.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.280]   True story, like, he woke up the next morning, he was fine,
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.460]   like, no fever, he wasn't even tired, he wasn't grumpy.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.820]   Like, it was amazing.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.860]   But let me tell you how my wife prayed.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.540]   Now, she's the much more spiritually mature
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:12.700]   one of the two of us.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.280]   She said, "Yeah, God, heal him if you want,
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.360]   "and please don't let this distract us
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.940]   "from our mission that you have us here.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.280]   "And God, when we're on the bus,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.240]   "and when we're in lines,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.260]   "and we're walking through the park,
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.080]   "will you please not let our selfishness distract us
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.700]   "from the people that you have around us
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.060]   "that you want us to love?"
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.940]   (laughs)
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.140]   I just have a hunch that God's like,
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.060]   "Hey, JP, good prayer.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.480]   "Hey, Monica, uh,
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.100]   (congregation laughs)
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.740]   "let's talk some more, you know?"
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.700]   Like, I just think he probably, like, lent his ear,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.980]   like, "Oh, yeah, okay, I'll do that."
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.820]   Right?
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.140]   Like, her heart is just a little more aligned
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.620]   with his character and what he's doing
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.820]   and what he wants to do.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.460]   She's praying from needs that matter,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.860]   eternal needs.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.840]   See, I think too often we look at prayer like room service.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:11.140]   Like, I like to go to a resort and pick up the phone,
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.160]   like, "Hey, JP, New York-style cheesecake,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.700]   "yeah, okay, I'll take one, you know,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.620]   "and a burger, and in the morning,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.860]   "omelets and some coffee if you could,
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.540]   "like, at this time, 'cause we like to sleep in,
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.280]   "you know, and I'm all about my comfort,
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.460]   "and I'm asking for those things
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.340]   "because I know that they can do that."
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.740]   And so I think we look at prayer like, you know,
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.180]   "Will you please let him ask me out?"
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.540]   And, "Lord, I pray that she's not pregnant.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.740]   "Lord, I pray that I'm not pregnant.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.840]   "God, would you please help me to get promoted?
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.920]   "Would you please help me to buy that car?
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.120]   "Would you please help me to get that apartment?"
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.700]   And I think prayer is much more like
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.580]   a walkie-talkie in a battle.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.420]   Like, you're talking to the commanding officer,
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.740]   like, "All right, I'm going in.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.860]   "Hey, what are you gonna have me do?
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.700]   "Okay, who is it?
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.540]   "Oh, you want me to share with him?
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.860]   "Okay, okay, who is it?
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.820]   "Okay, let's go, okay, so you love that one,
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.740]   "and that one, oh, okay, so you love them all.
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.260]   "All right, I'll share with them all, okay."
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.920]   And so you're like going back and forth, like,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.580]   "Okay, I wanna be about your work,
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.220]   "align my heart with what it is you're doing
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.140]   "because life is short,
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.200]   "and I'm not gonna be here very long.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.100]   "And in just a few decades,
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.260]   "I'm gonna be up there with you,
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.320]   "and I'm gonna be looking back,
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.620]   "and none of that other stuff's gonna matter,
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.540]   "and the only thing that matters
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.340]   "is the war that I did down here on your behalf.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.100]   "And you made me me, and you gave me the gifts
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.900]   "and the talents, and the story that you gave me.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.980]   "Like, how can I share faithfully?"
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.820]   Then I don't say that
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.260]   'cause I know there's introverts in the room like,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.380]   "Oh my goodness, I can't feel my legs."
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.180]   No, no. (congregation laughing)
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.540]   Listen, listen, it's God doing it.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.100]   God's like, "Hey, I got you, man.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.560]   "No, I got you.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.060]   "I'm just asking you to invite me into it.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:51.820]   "Like, invite me into the war that you're already in.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.960]   "Like, you're in a place where the kingdom is withered.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.520]   "Let's bring it back, okay?"
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.020]   While we were there, we were at this kind of play fort thing
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.180]   and I'm there with the kids and there's this tunnel,
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.060]   and it's a little tunnel.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.300]   And Weston, he's my two and a half year old,
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.140]   he crawls in there, and I'm like, "Go on, buddy, go on."
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.180]   And 'cause I see where it comes out,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.300]   it just kind of goes around the corner and it comes out.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.020]   And I'm like, "Go on, buddy, go on through."
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.380]   And he kind of crawls, puts one knee in front of the other,
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.580]   one hand in front of the other, and he looks back and goes,
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.120]   "Can you go with me, Daddy?"
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.940]   Yeah, oh, I'm six, seven, 250 pounds, and it's a small,
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.580]   and I'm like, "Well, you know,
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.300]   "hopefully those Disney ninjas are close,
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.220]   "'cause I'm about to get stuck in a tunnel."
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.100]   But here's the deal, that's what we're saying.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.940]   "Hey, can you go with me, Daddy?"
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.020]   Now, I'm gonna go in there, but can you go with me, Daddy?
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.660]   Like, you're inviting God into the work that you're doing.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.620]   And if you're scared, just turn back.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.220]   "Hey, can you go with me, Daddy?
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.420]   "Can we do this together?
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.580]   "Can we get happy?
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.580]   "Do you wanna bring the kingdom more than I do?
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.980]   "Will you go with me, Daddy?"
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.900]   I've heard it said that when life gets difficult to stand,
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.980]   when life gets too difficult to stand, kneel.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:14.180]   When life gets too difficult to stand, kneel.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.140]   Can I tell you something?
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.040]   Life is always too difficult to stand.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.380]   Like, life is freaking hard.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.940]   And you may not realize that, but yeah, there's an enemy.
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.840]   He's after you, he wants to kill you.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.980]   He wants to make you irrelevant.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.860]   He wants to turn your life into something
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   that has no impact whatsoever 200 years from now,
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.160]   that you'd be forgotten, to dust you'd return.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.740]   And life's hard, man.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.140]   And there's a lot of worries in this world.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.420]   If you focus on this world too long,
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.860]   I mean, the worries can just overwhelm you.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.820]   You could be given to anxiety, to a really dark place.
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.460]   And a God who holds it all in the palm of his hand says,
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.220]   "Hey, I got you, you're mine, I love you, and I'm for you.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.460]   "And there's nothing you're gonna face
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.280]   "that I don't control.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.460]   "Let's partner."
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.600]   First Timothy, I'm sorry, 1 Peter 5, 8 says,
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.840]   "Be alert, be watchful.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.220]   "Your enemy, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.980]   "looking for someone to devour."
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.680]   But you don't need to worry.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.080]   You pray and let God worry.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:17.280]   All right, pray and let God worry.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.140]   Paul says, "Pray that we would proclaim it clearly."
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.420]   Why, because prayer is the groundwork of evangelism.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.940]   In fact, I would tell you, don't share the gospel
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.740]   with anyone you haven't prayed for.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.560]   And I mean that.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.780]   Like, if you're on an elevator with someone
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.620]   and you're about to engage with them
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.820]   around spiritual things, pray for them first.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.140]   Like, make sure the Lord is in it.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.500]   Make sure he's giving you the words
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   that you're not doing so by your own strength,
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.380]   by your own power.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.260]   Prayer is the groundwork of evangelism.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.820]   In fact, evangelism without prayer,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.620]   it's like a car with no engine.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.660]   It's like words with no power.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.540]   We have to, prayer and evangelism,
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.900]   they go hand in hand.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.980]   Prayer and sharing your faith goes hand in hand.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.700]   We must invite the divine to awaken the dead.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.780]   Because you can't.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.340]   We must invite the divine to awaken the dead
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:07.260]   because saving is the work of God.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.100]   Early on, I was going to Watermark.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.300]   We met in Lake Highlands in the auditorium there.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.500]   And I had trusted Christ.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.580]   I was a new Christian.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.860]   But I was like straight out of the bars.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.300]   In fact, I still smelt like the club.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.780]   I would still show up in kind of my smokey clothes
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.620]   from the night before.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.300]   And when I moved to Dallas, I worked at Abercrombie.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.660]   That's actually why I moved to Dallas,
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.860]   to work at Abercrombie and North Park Mall.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.580]   I know what you're all thinking.
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.260]   Yes, I was the guy in front of the store with my shirt.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.060]   No, I wasn't, I'm just teasing.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.020]   Nobody would come in the store if that was true.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.660]   And so, no, but I was there and I worked with this dude.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.180]   And I see him in the parking lot of Watermark.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.780]   And he comes up, he's like, "JP, what are you doing here?"
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.540]   Which was a fair question
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.580]   'cause he's like, "JP, party guy, what are you doing here?"
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.700]   And I was like, "Well, I go to church here now."
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.820]   And he's like, "You do?"
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.420]   He was like, "Wow, I didn't even know you're a Christian."
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.340]   He's like, "Well, I wasn't, but I'm a Christian now."
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.300]   And I was like, "Dude, that's amazing."
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.100]   He goes, "Man, when we worked together,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.620]   "I prayed for you every day that the Lord would save you.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.820]   "I prayed that you would go to church here."
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.180]   And you think, if you're here and you're a Christian,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.100]   a follower of Christ,
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.340]   like you're the result of somebody else's prayer.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.300]   Like you've been prayed into the kingdom.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.620]   Like someone else prayed for you and now you're Christian.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.220]   I don't know if that was your mom or your dad
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.340]   or a friend or a pastor,
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.900]   but someone prayed you into the kingdom.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.140]   I mean, God saved you, nobody else saved you.
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.340]   And you being with God for eternity
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.740]   is the result of someone else's prayer.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:43.780]   I love that Paul is in chains
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.340]   and he doesn't ask that his situation be changed,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.440]   but rather that he would be faithful in it.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.120]   Is it okay to pray for what you want?
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.000]   Absolutely.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.240]   It absolutely is.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.560]   But make sure you're seeking what he wants
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.240]   because selfish prayers make selfish Christians.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.200]   Selfish prayers make selfish Christians.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.760]   And so if you just look back on your prayers today
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.760]   and if they were all answered,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.160]   like would you just have a better job
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.800]   and more money and a faster car?
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.700]   Or would there be dozens and dozens,
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.280]   maybe hundreds of people who are Christians
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.040]   because of the ways you prayed for them?
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.600]   And I'll tell you, one has incredible eternal significance
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.440]   and one doesn't.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:32.060]   You've never seen a good person on mission
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.740]   who's not constantly in communication
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.860]   with the control center or their commander.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.040]   And that's what Paul is calling us to here.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.200]   And he says, "Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.680]   "Make the most of every opportunity.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.120]   "Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders," verse five,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.280]   "Make the most of every opportunity."
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.320]   And so what do people on mission have?
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.960]   People on mission have opportunities that matter.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.640]   That's my second point this evening,
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.200]   opportunities that matter.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.560]   This part here where it says,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.440]   "Be wise, make the most of every opportunity,"
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.120]   in the Greek, it's actually an accounting term.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.560]   He's saying, hey, you only have so much time,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.520]   make sure that you exchange that time
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.320]   for things that actually matter.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.960]   You wanna make the most of every opportunity.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.780]   Don't exchange that time for things that don't matter.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.400]   That's really bad investing.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.100]   He's saying, hey, make sure you invest your time wisely.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.560]   That's what Paul is saying here.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.000]   Invest your time wisely towards things
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.180]   that have eternal significance.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:31.600]   And he's saying, "Be very aware of when you are around
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.760]   "non-believers," those he calls outside,
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.240]   those outside the church.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.840]   "These are indeed your opportunities."
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.020]   And he says, "Be wise in the way you act."
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.780]   He's talking about your conduct.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.100]   In fact, 1 Peter 2, verse 11, says it like this.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.700]   "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.280]   "to abstain from sinful desires
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.440]   "which wage war against your soul.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.320]   "Live such good lives among the pagans
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.740]   "that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.060]   "they may see your good deeds and glorify God
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.500]   "on the day he visits us."
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.060]   I can remember wrestling with this with my old friends
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.540]   who are not Christians.
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.020]   And whenever I was going to hang out with them,
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.660]   I would ask the question,
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.320]   am I going to be able to influence them
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.500]   or am I going to be influenced by them?
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.740]   And when you're wondering,
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.260]   hey, should I hang out with those old friends?
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.380]   You ask that question.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.980]   Am I going to be influenced by them
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.860]   or are they going to give me opportunities
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.020]   to influence them towards the gospel?
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:29.980]   'Cause I think a lot of people are like,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.060]   yeah, well, I'm evangelizing in the bar.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.860]   It's like, no, you're not, you're drinking in the bar.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.060]   That's not evangelism.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.260]   What are you, evangelism, evangelizing for Sky Vodka?
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.260]   I mean, what are you evangelizing for, right?
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.260]   And so if you're living under that mantra,
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.940]   like, hey, I'm doing kingdom work there,
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.340]   then make sure you are doing kingdom work there.
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:54.060]   Make sure you're making investments that matter.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.980]   And so what are the best opportunities
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.380]   for you to make the most of?
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.900]   Let me be abundantly clear with you.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.140]   We go to Haiti, we go to Africa.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.980]   If earthquakes hit Nepal, like, we'll probably go there.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.580]   I mean, we go where the Lord needs us, where he calls us.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.620]   Like, we'll go, we'll load you up on a bus or plane
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.700]   or whatever that looks like, a boat, and we'll go.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.180]   And I hope you go with us.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.460]   But the ones we take on mission there
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.180]   are the ones who live on mission here, right?
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.140]   That's the best investment of our kingdom resources.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.020]   We take the ones on mission there
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.540]   who are already on mission here.
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.100]   And so what are the opportunities around you?
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.100]   It's where you work, it's your neighborhood,
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.540]   it's those you engage with.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.620]   I've been very clear, I believe the darkest mission field
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.860]   I've ever seen is corporate America.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.980]   Now, that's saying something,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.660]   'cause I've been into the jungles of Africa,
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.020]   I've been into the jungles of the Amazon and Brazil,
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.580]   I've been to Haiti, I've gone to other places
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.220]   on trips to Mexico and other parts of our world.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.620]   And I'll tell you from experience,
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.380]   the darkest mission field I've ever seen
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.860]   was right here in downtown Dallas.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.900]   And there are parts of the world
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.700]   that are unbelievably difficult to get to,
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.060]   the Congo or parts of the Middle East,
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.340]   but it's very possible.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.380]   But you know where I can't get to today?
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:23.660]   The ninth floor of the building I worked in
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.580]   every single day of my life.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.340]   Had a security badge,
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.980]   walked through two security checkpoints,
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.100]   I had a cube with six people around me
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.780]   that I engaged with every single day.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.540]   And no matter how badly I wanted to go there today,
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.580]   I couldn't do it, I don't have,
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.140]   I don't work there, they wouldn't let me up there.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.060]   That's where God has opportunities for you.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.020]   What are your opportunities?
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.300]   It's whenever you're around outsiders.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.460]   These are the opportunities you're to make the most of
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.660]   and be wise in.
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.060]   Acts 17 says that God has determined where you live
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.740]   and when you live, strategically,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.580]   because he wants to build a kingdom through you.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.300]   That's why you have breath in your lungs.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.980]   That's why your heart beats in your chest.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.140]   I know in all of you,
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.820]   there's something deep inside of you that cries out,
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.900]   there has to be something more to life than this.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.400]   And can I tell you the truth?
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.340]   There is.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.300]   There is, it's his work.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.140]   There is.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:37.140]   Titus 2, verses nine and 10 says,
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.460]   this teach slaves, what Greg taught us as employees,
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.900]   to be subject to their masters or employers in everything,
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.740]   to try to please them, not to talk back to them
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.980]   and not to steal from them,
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.140]   but to show that they can be fully trusted.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.180]   And here's why, you ready?
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.060]   I want you to hear the why.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.660]   Work diligently and here's why.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.980]   So that in every way,
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.140]   they will make the teaching about God, our Savior,
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.180]   attractive.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.300]   Why do you work hard?
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.140]   For a promotion?
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.960]   No, for more money?
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.860]   No, to make the teaching of your Savior attractive.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.660]   That's your mission at work.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.900]   Your job exists so that others
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.900]   will be attracted to your Savior.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.740]   That's us, we work here on earth,
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.460]   but we seek to do the Father's will as his chosen people.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.220]   I, about two and a half days into Disney,
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.620]   I saw something really peculiar.
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.460]   I was sitting there in a line for a ride with my family
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.140]   and I looked in the bushes and I saw a cup.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.980]   It was litter.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.300]   And the reason it was peculiar
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.900]   is because for two and a half days, I had seen none.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.640]   In a park of tens of thousands of people,
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.340]   maybe hundreds of thousands, I don't know,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.140]   but thousands and thousands and thousands
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.340]   and thousands of people,
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.620]   I didn't see a single piece of litter
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.420]   for two and a half days.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.820]   Why?
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.840]   Because of the 62,000 employees,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.780]   they've trained all of them
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.340]   to constantly be about kingdom work.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.900]   Even the princesses, they go through a class
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.780]   to learn how to pick up trash.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.460]   It's called the swoop.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.020]   Graceful.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.580]   And throw it away.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.260]   Without anyone noticing.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.100]   You guys didn't even know.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:17.920]   Here's what just happened.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.220]   I just bent down and picked up a piece of trash.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.860]   You didn't even see that.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.700]   Okay?
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.660]   And they're trained to do that.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.500]   Why?
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.940]   Because every employer there is making the kingdom magical.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.860]   That's what we're doing.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.740]   We work for a real magical kingdom,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.340]   not some phony Disney Channel magical kingdom
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.580]   of princes and princesses.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.800]   A real one.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.060]   That is God's, and we're building it here
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.540]   in Dallas and Fort Worth and Plano
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.740]   and surrounding areas.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.100]   We're doing that work here.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.260]   I went to this biblical worldview class,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.700]   and I remember sitting in the class
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.000]   and they kept saying biblical worldview,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.480]   biblical worldview, biblical worldview.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.580]   And I'm like, what, is somebody gonna define that?
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.420]   Because am I the only one in the class
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.700]   that doesn't know what that is?
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.780]   And then it hit me.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.380]   Halfway through the course, I'm like, oh.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.300]   Like it's just seeing the world
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.200]   as God intended it to be seen.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.820]   Or it's making the world as God intended it.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:19.460]   It's leaving every place I go better than I found it.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.140]   Every relationship I'm in better than I found it.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.260]   Could you imagine if you dated like that?
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.980]   Like could you imagine if your ex-girlfriend
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.580]   was a better wife because you dated her,
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.740]   because you're her ex-boyfriend?
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:34.700]   Could you imagine?
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.520]   Every place we go, that we would leave it better
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.580]   than we found it by the way that we engage with people,
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.260]   by the way we make the most of every opportunity.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.700]   And so look back on your life,
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.060]   and what have been your greatest opportunities?
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.780]   And did you see them as mission?
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.060]   Did you see them as kingdom work?
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.900]   Did you see them as God's work?
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:05.500]   He says, verse six, let your conversations
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.700]   be always full of grace, seasoned with salt,
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.900]   so that you may know how to answer everyone.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.820]   Let your conversation be always full of grace,
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.620]   seasoned with salt, so that you may know
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.700]   how to answer everyone.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.540]   So what do people on mission have?
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.420]   People on mission have conversations that matter.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.260]   People on mission have conversations
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.980]   that have eternal significance.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.140]   This is our greatest tool to complete our mission,
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.580]   is conversation.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.120]   So who should we talk to?
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.620]   Anyone we can.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.300]   See to complete our mission work,
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.180]   we talk to God about people, and to people about God.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.220]   What is our mission?
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.660]   It's to talk to God about people,
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.700]   and to people about God.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.380]   This is how we live our lives.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.460]   The tool that we use is conversation.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.900]   The other day I was having appetizers with a friend,
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.020]   and we were just talking about,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.140]   he's a pastor of ministry, my friend John Elmore,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.720]   some of you know him, and we were getting up,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.540]   and my buddy, John's an introvert, okay,
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.040]   and so he just, this story, I'm gonna read you
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.220]   the script of what happened, and it removes every excuse.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.500]   And so he gets up, and there's this guy,
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.380]   the bus boy comes over to bus the table,
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:22.380]   and he's cleaning the table, and John says,
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.420]   hey, what's your name?
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.100]   And he says, Alfonso, and John says, where are you from?
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.660]   And he answers, and John says, cool,
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.660]   well, we work at a church, and I'd like to invite you there.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.960]   And he looks at him, and he goes, I will come.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:41.740]   And he goes, cool, it's 9, 11, and 5.30 this Sunday.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:43.760]   And he goes, I will bring my family.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.640]   And John goes, okay, well, I'll tell you where it is.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   And he goes, I don't care where it is,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.040]   this will be my church.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.720]   This is word for word, and I'm sitting there.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.560]   And John's like, all right.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.320]   And so we walk to the car, and I'm like,
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.080]   dude, that was insulting, that guy was patronizing you.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.280]   And John's like, oh, you don't think he'll come?
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.200]   I'm like, dude, there's no way he's gonna come.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.480]   He said, bro, let me read it back to you,
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.160]   I don't care where it is, this will be my church.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.400]   He's not coming.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.960]   So we just go on about our day.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.920]   I'm like, okay, John texts me the next day.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.480]   He's like, hey, Alfonso just called, wanted directions.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.560]   I'm like, dude, he's messing with you, bro.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.400]   He's messing with you.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.520]   I'm up here, I get here, it's Baptism Sunday,
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.560]   and I'm up there, and I bump into John,
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.000]   and he's like, hey, he's in here.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.480]   And he shows me the text message,
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.640]   and the guy's like, hey, I'm listening
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.200]   to Laura's testimony right now, can we meet outside?
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.040]   I'm like, what?
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.500]   That guy, he doesn't go to church.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.600]   John says, hey, do you wanna go?
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.400]   He goes, I will go.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.280]   I will be there with my family.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.320]   Who does that?
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.680]   Who says?
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.480]   John's like, hey, let's have conversations that matter.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.160]   Like, let me have, like, this is fun
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.280]   been talking to you, okay, but here's the deal.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.800]   I wanna have conversations that matter.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.000]   Like, that story removes any excuse
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.080]   you could possibly come up with
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.560]   to engage someone about spiritual things.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.320]   That dude, I mean, that's just the work of God.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.080]   Is that not God just flexing?
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.480]   Is that not God just showing off?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.160]   God's just like, hey, dude, do you want me
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.460]   to remind you that this is me and not you?
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.200]   Like, open your mouth and let me do work.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   Okay, God.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.840]   So our conversations are always full of grace,
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.060]   full of encouragement, explaining the hope we have.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.180]   I've got two little girls.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.700]   Every day on our way to school, we go over this verse
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.940]   because they struggle with this.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.340]   You know, sometimes they potty talk,
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:39.900]   and sometimes they hurt each other with their words,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.860]   and so we just say, hey, what's Ephesians 4, 29?
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.420]   It says, "Do not let any unwholesome talk
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.820]   "come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.420]   "for building others up so that it may benefit
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.860]   "those who listen."
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.660]   And I say, hey, who is going to benefit
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.100]   from the words that come out of your mouth today?
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.300]   Because here's the deal, words are powerful.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.720]   Words break hearts.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.740]   Words give hope.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.820]   Words encourage.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.900]   Words tear down.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.460]   Words have power.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.700]   They persuade men, and so once you understand
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.860]   that you've been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.160]   you use your words to persuade men, Paul says,
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.180]   so that they would be a part of the kingdom
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.100]   that you are a part of.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.500]   Do you want a good reason?
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.260]   Let me give you a really good reason not to slander,
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.700]   not to gossip, not to talk poorly, not to cuss,
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.120]   not to joke coarsely.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.580]   There's no time.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.300]   People are dying.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.900]   People are going to hell.
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.300]   You want to waste your words on gossip?
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.860]   Ain't nobody got time for that.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.540]   You're about to die.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.360]   They're about to die.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.020]   You're about to stand before God.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.220]   You want to waste your words talking about stuff
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.300]   that doesn't matter?
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.100]   Who's got time for that?
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:57.260]   You've got a measly couple decades left, maybe.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.860]   If there's a kingdom wilting around us
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.300]   we've got to lift the curse.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.240]   We've got to do work.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.520]   We've got to build it.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.560]   He says, know how to answer everyone.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.520]   Man, Jesus.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.320]   You know how Jesus answered everyone?
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.920]   It would be kind of frustrating to me.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.400]   He answered everyone with questions.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.960]   23 times people asked him questions in the gospel
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   and he responds with a question.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.960]   In fact, I read a book called "Questioning Evangelism"
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.440]   that taught this evangelism method with questions.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.280]   I find it to be really powerful
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.720]   that you can just kind of, people say,
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.280]   hey, I'm a Christian, I'm a Christian evangelist.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.000]   You know, that you can just kind of,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.840]   people say, hey, how are you doing today?
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.720]   And you just be like, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.080]   Good, do you have a faith?
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.900]   You know, it's like,
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.320]   now we're talking about spiritual things.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.360]   What a powerful question, do you have a faith?
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.420]   Do you have a belief, a spirituality?
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.520]   Do you attend church somewhere?
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.440]   Are you into church?
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.680]   Is that part of your life?
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.040]   Hey, what's your story?
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.120]   I'd love to hear your story.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.280]   How long have you lived in Dallas?
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.880]   Now we're talking.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.700]   Do you have a faith?
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.120]   Now we're talking about eternally significant things.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.960]   Now we're living on mission.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.240]   This is what Jesus did.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.520]   People are like, well, what about dinosaurs in the Bible?
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.680]   What do you think about dinosaurs in the Bible?
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.520]   Do you think they're in there?
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.280]   Do you think that the Bible references dinosaurs?
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.960]   Have you ever read anything good on that?
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.480]   If I gave you something good on that to read,
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.160]   would you read it?
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.080]   Well, what about dispensationalism and transubstantiation?
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.300]   Dude, I don't know.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.800]   I don't even know what those words are.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.800]   But let me ask you a question.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   If I found out what those words are
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   and how they're relevant to this conversation,
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.600]   could we have lunch and talk about it?
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.200]   Now we're talking about eternally significant things.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.800]   Nothing intimidating about that.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.720]   Well, how do you know that Jesus is true?
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.000]   How do you know he's not?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.240]   How do you know the Bible can be trusted?
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.440]   Why don't you think the Bible can be trusted?
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.400]   We're just talking.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.240]   No big deal.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.200]   This is what it looks like to live on mission.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.640]   Disney was a mission trip for us, for our family.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.360]   I hope it was.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.400]   I hope the trip was not just a vacation.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.520]   I hope it had eternal significance.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.920]   I'll tell you just about a glimpse of it.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.800]   Not at all to brag or, that's not my heart,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.000]   but just to show you how these conversations
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.440]   can be much easier than you think.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.160]   We wake up, this is just the way back to Dallas.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.800]   We woke up yesterday, I got back yesterday.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.960]   We woke up yesterday in Orlando,
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.760]   called a cab early in the morning to the airport,
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.040]   get in the cab, there's a cab driver's name is Muhammad.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.240]   Hey, Muhammad, where are you from?
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.040]   Bangladesh, amazing.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.920]   Are you Muslim?
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.960]   What'd you say?
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.480]   Are you of the Islamic faith?
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.960]   Oh, yes, I am, cool.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.320]   Sunni or Shiite?
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.160]   I'm Sunni.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.520]   Oh, man, amazing.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.920]   Bangladesh is 90% Sunni Muslim, right?
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.320]   Yeah, yeah, well, how'd you know that?
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.440]   Man, I'm a teacher.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.280]   What do you teach?
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.800]   I teach religion.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.760]   Awesome.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.720]   Have you ever looked into Christianity?
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.360]   Ah, you know, I don't know much about it,
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.440]   but can I tell you about it?
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.560]   There's a God, he's building a magical kingdom.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.360]   He did so through his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.880]   who died for everything wrong you've done.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.440]   We're talking about spiritually,
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.600]   eternally significant things.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.120]   Man, how great is that?
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   Get to the airport, we get on the plane.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.920]   American, man.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.760]   Woo.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.680]   Had sorted my family, okay, five of us,
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.320]   three kids, a two and a half year old,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.680]   all throughout the plane sporadically.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.880]   That's really bad strategy for American.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.800]   And so my two and a half year old sitting next to this guy,
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.840]   he realizes that's a really bad idea,
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.680]   'cause he's smart.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.440]   He gets up, he says, "Hey," to my wife,
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.240]   he says, "Monica, why don't you sit beside him?
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.080]   "We're grateful."
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.840]   I thanked him, I'm like, "Hey, I'm so grateful for you.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.560]   "Hey, thank you so much for that.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.640]   "Hey, what's your story?"
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   Well, I work for 7-Eleven,
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:40.920]   I'm moving to Dallas from Orlando.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.680]   That's amazing, man, I work in Dallas too.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.120]   Can I ask you a question, do you have a faith?
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.080]   Well, it's funny you should ask that.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.800]   I was raised Catholic, I married a Mormon.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.960]   We settled on a Methodist church.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.560]   I'm like, wow, that's interesting.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.080]   It is funny I should ask.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.600]   I was raised Catholic, I married a girl
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.720]   who was Church of Christian Science.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.320]   Very similar story to yours.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.160]   We settled on a non-denominational Bible teaching church.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.080]   Would you like to come?
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.360]   He said, "I will be there."
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.200]   No, he didn't say that.
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.560]   He didn't say that.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.720]   But he did say, "Here's my card, text me the address."
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.720]   And so, yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.280]   And then we get off the plane and my kids are hungry
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.680]   and there's a papacitas in the airport
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.960]   as we're waiting for our bag check.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.800]   And I said, "We will eat."
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.600]   And we sit down, because I'm a caveman, evidently.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.000]   We sit down and our server comes up.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.640]   His name is Benjamin.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.000]   I said, "Hey, do you have 11 brothers?"
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.360]   He said, "No."
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.480]   I said, "Do you know why I asked that?"
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.680]   He said, "No."
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.520]   And I said, he goes, "That's a weird question."
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.240]   I said, "I'm a weird dude."
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:01.520]   And I said, "Do you know where your name comes from?"
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.360]   And he goes, "Oh, wait, wait, wait,
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.600]   "I'm a son of Abraham, right?"
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.400]   I said, "Close."
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.360]   And we started talking about spiritual things.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.240]   I said, "Are you in a church?"
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.680]   He said, "Yes, I'm a Christian."
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.200]   And then up in the conversation, it was very apparent,
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.680]   Benjamin was not a Christian.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.680]   I said, "Would you like to be one?"
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:20.280]   And we're just talking about spiritual things.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.520]   That's being on a mission.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.280]   And that's how we're going to build the kingdom here.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.240]   We've lost it.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   And there's enough people in the room right now
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.680]   and listening live throughout our country
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.520]   and our world and in Fort Worth
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.360]   that have everything it takes to bring the kingdom back.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.200]   If we just did the kingdom work,
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.440]   if we just refocused on the things of God.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.200]   (pages rustling)
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:55.160]   I want you to look back on your life
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.880]   and the conversations you've had.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.880]   If it's been 452 gossips and 247 curse words
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.120]   and 692 sarcastic remarks and 300 lies
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.040]   and four times you shared your faith,
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.680]   I wanna love you enough to know,
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.120]   to let you know you wasted a lot of conversation.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   There's very little eternally significant words shared.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.920]   And you don't have to feel shame for that.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.960]   Let's just change that right now.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.640]   Let's just leave this place and change that.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.520]   Just be different.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.040]   I don't know if you know what a knock is.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.480]   Anybody know what a knock is?
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.200]   This illustration's gonna kill.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.320]   A knock is a non-official cover agent.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.120]   A non-official cover agent.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.960]   I learned this through a Navy SEAL friend of mine.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.280]   I was actually looking for an illustration one day.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.840]   What a non-official cover agent is,
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.240]   if you've ever seen the first "Mission Impossible,"
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.880]   you'll recall he had to recover a knock list,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.400]   which is a non-official cover agent list.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.960]   A knock is someone who is actually working,
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.600]   but they actually work for the CIA,
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.520]   they work for the government,
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.840]   but they're employed by a company
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.680]   like the company that you work for.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.160]   And so what this looks like is,
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.360]   is somebody employed by the CIA
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.440]   would actually go to like,
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.920]   let's just say Richardson Independent School District,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.560]   and they would interview for a job,
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:20.600]   and they would get the job,
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.680]   but while they're working there
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.880]   at Independent School District,
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.600]   they actually work for the CIA.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.400]   They're reporting to their central command center,
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.920]   their constant communication.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.520]   They're making the most of every opportunity,
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.800]   being wise in the way they act toward outsiders
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.120]   so that they don't get caught.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.080]   And they are having conversations winsomely
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.240]   and purposefully to gather information.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.160]   And can I tell you something?
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.480]   You're all knock agents.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.400]   You are all sent by God as non-official cover agents.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.920]   That's who we are.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.120]   All right, that's what we're doing.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.360]   And just to give it to you, another acronym,
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.040]   you on mission have needs that matter,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.400]   opportunities that matter,
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.840]   and conversations that matter.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.320]   N-O-C, you are a knock.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   I'm a knock, a non-official cover agent.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.160]   And you can imagine how tragic it would be
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.840]   if someone who worked for the CIA,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.200]   let's just say at the Richardson Independent School District
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.880]   got so caught up in being a teacher
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.320]   that they forgot they worked for the CIA.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.560]   And they just thought that their only job there
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.920]   was to teach the students.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.200]   And they stopped talking to the Central Command Center.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.400]   They lost sight of the mission.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.080]   They stopped being winsome in the way
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.240]   that they engaged people.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.440]   They stopped making the most of every opportunity.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.720]   And all they did was got swept up
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.160]   in the job that was in front of them.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:54.200]   That the job that actually mattered got lost in that.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   Some of us have lived that.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.500]   Some of us have lived that right now.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.400]   You think that all you are is an account manager
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:05.040]   or barista or a teacher.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:11.280]   You think that all you are is an engineer or an artist.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.480]   You think that all you are is a sales rep.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.080]   And God says, no, you're an agent of mine
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.480]   building a kingdom in a foreign land.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.960]   I have you on mission there.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   Don't get so caught up in the world
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.600]   that you forsake the mission that I have you on
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.960]   and the things that I wanna do through you.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.880]   You're my agent.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:38.200]   When we were at Disney,
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.640]   I don't know if you've been,
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.960]   you can go and get autographs from like the princesses
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.440]   and stuff and like Mickey and the characters and whatnot.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.240]   And it's really a magical kingdom for the kids.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.040]   And so you like gotta stand in line for this,
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:51.880]   like Elsa and Anna.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.640]   Do you guys know who those are, Elsa and Anna?
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.680]   Of course you do, okay.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.280]   Do you wanna build a snowman?
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.960]   And so Elsa and Anna, the princesses,
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.200]   you can meet 'em if you wanna wait two and a half hours
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.720]   in 90 degree weather.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.440]   And you can get their signature.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.400]   And in the line is full of giddy six year olds
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.600]   and seven year olds and eight year olds.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.640]   And every now and then, you would see a 34 year old
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.320]   by themselves.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.360]   And in fact, there was one guy,
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.720]   he sketched himself with all of the characters.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.560]   This dude was 29 years old, I think.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.440]   He sketched himself with all the characters
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.680]   and then he went throughout the park
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.120]   and had them sign autographs.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.160]   And he was just besides himself.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.680]   He's like, I got Cinderella's autograph.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.000]   And even my eight year old's like,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.560]   you know it's not really Cinderella, you know.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.120]   And you just see these kinda weird creeper dudes.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.440]   Like there was this other guy,
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.240]   that there's like this sorcerer game
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.120]   and there's this six year old playing this game
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.720]   and you have this wand and you go
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.680]   and you're trying to get this magic ball
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.360]   and do this kinda magic potion
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.400]   and go and get the fairy dust.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.360]   And this 45 year old goes to the six year old kid
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.560]   and says, hey, you're doing it all wrong.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.200]   Like you wanna go and get the star of magic first
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.240]   and then go back and then get the green globe
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.640]   because that's where the sorcerer's magic is.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.480]   And I'm like, dude, you're weird.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   He's like, no, this is what he said.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.080]   He said, I'm here every day I play this game.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.120]   And I'm like, bro, that's sad.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.680]   Like your parents brought you when you were 13
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.080]   and you never left, man.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.920]   Like this is just a place to go on vacation.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.040]   Like it's not a place to live.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.400]   And you don't wanna get real caught up
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.040]   in the stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.760]   And just like we see that and we laugh at it
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.120]   because it's kind of funny.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:36.000]   Some of us we're gonna stand before God
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.920]   and we're gonna realize we were chasing princesses
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.920]   and princes and sorcerer's wands
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.600]   and weird stuff that didn't trinkets and treasures
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.560]   and promotions and cars and houses
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.080]   and stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.720]   And one day we're gonna look back
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.800]   and we're gonna see everything that actually mattered.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.840]   And I just wanna make sure you invested in what mattered.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:05.120]   I pray that we would invest in what matters.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:05.960]   Let me pray.
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.480]   Father, would you help us do that?
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:16.080]   Show us what is of you, what is not of you.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:20.960]   Show us the work you're doing that we might take part in it
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.360]   and partner with you in it.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.160]   And Father, I pray that you would come in our world
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.000]   like a hurricane and tear down the walls
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.920]   and the kingdoms that we built that aren't your kingdom.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.960]   The things that we've held onto that don't matter,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.520]   they have no eternal significance whatsoever.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.080]   Father, would you destroy them by your power
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.680]   and fix our hearts and our minds of you.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.080]   What a terrifying prayer
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.160]   if we're gripping the world so tightly.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.720]   Father, help us loosen that grip.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:51:02.200]   Help us lose that grip for your glory and your honor.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:08.200]   Father, help us to live sold out for you
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:12.960]   as agents on mission, being devoted to prayer,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.040]   making the most of every opportunity
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.200]   and having conversations that are full of grace,
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.000]   seasoned with salt so that you might save some.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.720]   In the name of Jesus, amen.
