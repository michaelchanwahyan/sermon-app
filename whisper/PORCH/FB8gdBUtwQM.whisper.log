[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [music]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.020]   [music]
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.780]   [music]
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.660]   Well, Porsche, what's up? How we doing? Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.360]   Hey, it's so good to be here. By way of reminder, my name is Kylan.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.600]   It is my joy to get to be here. My wife's name is Brooke, and we have been
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.180]   anticipating this moment for a really long time. We love Dallas.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.680]   I'm not just saying that because I got to get you on my side quick.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280]   I'm saying that because I married a piece of Dallas. Brooke is from here.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.080]   She grew up in Plano, and now we're here. We made it at long last.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.620]   We always thought, "God, you might bring us back to Dallas," and here we are.
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.160]   You know, I guess he has a way with getting us where he wants us to be.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.500]   You know, I've thought a lot about what I would say in this moment.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.840]   And so what I wanted to do is I just wanted to give to you three convictions that guard
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.240]   and guide my ministry, three things that I think the Lord has put on me that I'm
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.180]   responsible to answer to whenever I stand before him at the end of my days.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.120]   These convictions, they will come to bear on us here.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   That's why I'm sharing them with you. So if you have any issue with them,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.260]   we love you. These are non-negotiables.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260]   This is going to be a part of what we do here, but here they are.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.800]   The first conviction is that we will always follow Jesus.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.700]   We will always follow Jesus. This ministry is not mine.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.500]   Like, God has entrusted it to me for a season as he has entrusted it to other
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.820]   faithful men in times past, but the Lord is the one that leads the porch.
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.660]   And so we will always follow Jesus. Number two, we will only teach the truth.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.960]   We will only teach the truth.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.660]   We will absolutely take the world into consideration and bring the culture into
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.960]   our doors, but we believe that the truth does in fact set people free.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.300]   And then lastly, we will never take the credit.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.000]   We'll never take the credit.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.640]   I love to say that the glory is God's and the privilege is mine.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   It's great to be here with you.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.980]   I do want to give a special shout out to some friends we have tuning in with us
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.920]   from all over the nation. Everybody say hey to our Porch Live locations.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.400]   So great to have you tuning in with us.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.400]   We've got Porch Live locations in Midland, Fort Worth, Tulsa, Scottsdale, Fresno,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.000]   Boise, Indy, Greater Lafayette, Dayton, Des Moines, and Atlanta.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.740]   God is doing something amazing here and he's doing something amazing all over the
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.540]   nation by way of this ministry.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.180]   And I have a lot of love for Porch Live locations because I used to be a part of
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.680]   one when I was in Houston.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120]   Houston Metro was birthed out of the Porch Live Houston.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.280]   So we love you guys.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.060]   We're grateful that you're tuning in with us and we're expecting for what the Lord
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.400]   has ahead.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.260]   Well, let me start off by just setting things up with this.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.100]   When my wife and I were dating in college, I crafted a date that I'm convinced is the
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.680]   most creative date I've ever come up with in our time since.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.480]   We've been married for six years, perfect, counted that out correctly,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.820]   and together for nine.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.280]   And I made sure that as I evaluated our past history, this is the most creative
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.660]   date that I can actually think of.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.060]   I've not been able to top it.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.900]   Now, if you're a guy in the room, you understand that when you're dating
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.400]   someone, especially early in the relationship, you have to handle with
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.420]   great care the dates that you craft for that special someone.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.100]   You've got to craft a date that's not too romantic that it makes them think,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.500]   "Whoa, he's coming on way too strong."
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.300]   And you have to think about crafting a date that's not too simple that they think
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   you're not trying at all.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.780]   Like you have to come up with a date that is this perfect mixture of thoughtful,
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.860]   yet easy, that leaves her thinking, "Oh, my gosh, like he is...
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.660]   He's amazing."
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.100]   I mean, just it was so easy and fun and chill getting to hang out with him,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.500]   while simultaneously leaving her thinking, "He is the most thoughtful man
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.140]   in the world.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.980]   I've never met anybody like him."
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.940]   That's a small window to hit, ladies.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.300]   Guys, can I get some appreciation that that's a hard thing to do?
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.660]   And yet, what we know is that I did it.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.620]   I figured it out.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.500]   So you're probably wondering to yourself, "Well, then what was the date?"
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.740]   This is what the date was.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.660]   The date was rock climbing.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.180]   Now, I know, hold on, hold on.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.620]   Now, I know that's not what you were expecting, but this is not your normal,
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.100]   ordinary, everyday, run-of-the-mill kind of rock climbing.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.460]   Like we're not just recreationally out there grabbing some wall and making our
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.380]   way up.
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.820]   No, I had designed a very particular kind of rock climbing.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.780]   You see, what I had decided to do is I decided to take us to this wall.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.780]   We're scattered across its entirety.
[00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:33.900]   We're not only handholds to find, but handwritten notes to discover.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.460]   You see, these handwritten notes, they were created by yours truly,
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.620]   and they were placed upon the wall.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.700]   And as you made your way and you found them, they entitled you to certain
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.380]   benefits.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.780]   You could get Starbucks for a week, or maybe you would, hey, you pick up dinner,
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.340]   or how about concert tickets on me, or any of the above.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.300]   All sorts of different things, a myriad of blessings upon this great
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.220]   rock wall.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.660]   And so I knew it was going to be excellent, and I had the hookup because one of my
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.420]   really good friends was actually the manager of the rock wall at Texas A&M
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.100]   University.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.260]   And so I coordinated with him.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.860]   I was like, "Hey, man, I want this to be super special.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.700]   And so is there any way we can get the wall to ourselves reserved privately
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.420]   after hours so the entire thing is ours?
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.660]   I don't want to see any other dudes in a harness.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.260]   It's awkward enough for me."
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.860]   So we want it by ourself.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.740]   And so we showed up, and what was amazing because he was the manager of the rock
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.900]   wall is he had already preset all of these notes upon the wall.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.820]   And so we get there, and we harness up, and we belay on, and we start to make
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.260]   our way up the wall.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.580]   You see, what's amazing, apart from just the date itself, is that by throwing in
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.780]   this wrinkle, our rock climbing experience completely changed.
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.660]   Like by introducing these notes, we weren't simply just trying to get up the
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.620]   wall.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:57.340]   Now we were considering, "How am I going to get up the wall?"
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.220]   It changed the game.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.100]   We knew as we stood at the base of it, like, "Okay, the goal is still to get up
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.300]   to the top of this thing, but the way we're going to do that is going to vary
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.420]   depending upon what you want and what I want."
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.820]   Like, "My route is going to be guided by these notes, these goals that I want
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.220]   to achieve."
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.420]   And so Brooke would look at the wall and say, "That mani-pedi looks great."
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.020]   And so she would start to make her way up that specific route because that was the
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.260]   goal guiding her direction.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.900]   For me, I wanted her to plan a date, and so I would make my way towards that note
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.980]   instead.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:40.580]   You see, these notes, these goals, they guided the decisions we made.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.980]   Though we were heading in the same direction up the wall, they changed the
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.300]   course in the way that we ascended.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.780]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.980]   Because I think life, especially here at the beginning of a brand new year, is a
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.780]   lot like that wall.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.460]   Like, we're all standing at the base of it, a brand new year, and we're trying to
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.980]   discern what goals are going to determine the way that I navigate over the course of
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.460]   this year in specific.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:22.460]   How am I going to make my way, not up this wall, but through this year in specific?
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.660]   And what's interesting is while there's some mixed opinion on whether New Year's
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.140]   resolution and goal setting, if it's still a thing or not, what we actually know is
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:37.140]   that personal development is just as popular as it's always been.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.500]   According to the 2024 Instagram trend talk, young adults from across the globe are
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:48.460]   defining this year, 2024, as what many in our generation call their growth era, or a
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.460]   period of concerted self-improvement, which begs the question, what are we trying to
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.620]   improve exactly?
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.540]   If this is our growth era, what are we trying to grow?
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.140]   Well, if you go and you look at data from Forbes 2024 Health Survey or the GWI
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.860]   Trends Survey, young adults are specifically invested in improving their physical and
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.580]   mental health, that's one, their financial independence, that's two, and their
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.420]   experiential enrichment.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.700]   They just really want to enjoy life, find things that make them happy.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.220]   And these goals are interestingly not new to us.
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.500]   These are goals that, yes, they're true this year, but they were also true last year.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:34.940]   If you go and you search the #2023goals on TikTok, which has more than 360 million
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:41.620]   views, what's reported are the exact same list of goals, just in varying order of
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.580]   priority, depending upon whether you're Generation Z or you're a millennial.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.900]   What's my point in saying that?
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:54.900]   If you look at the research, many of us across social, spiritual, cultural
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:01.220]   backgrounds are all aiming at the same thing.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:06.860]   We're looking at three goals pretty broadly.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:13.060]   And the three goals we share is we want to be self-sufficient, we want to be capable
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:20.460]   on our own, we want self-acceptance, we want to be enough on our own, and we want
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.220]   self-fulfillment, we want to be happy on our own.
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.500]   We think this is in for 2024, but over the course of the next three weeks, as we
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.100]   journey through this new series together, what we're going to find is that according
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.620]   to Jesus, these goals are actually out.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.700]   If you have a Bible, you can turn with me to the book of Matthew.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.540]   We're going to be in chapter 6 together.
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.180]   If you don't have a Bible, we would love to give one to you.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.820]   You can pick that up outside in the foyer.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.940]   We're also going to have the scriptures up on the screens for you.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.460]   But here's what you need to know as we start this brand new series.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.100]   We're starting the series because we think it's appropriate at the beginning of a new
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:04.020]   year to ask the question, "Are my goals in line with God's will for my life?"
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.900]   That's what we're calling ins and outs.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.700]   Are my ins supposed to be in, or is God saying something else?
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.460]   Should they be out instead?
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.980]   And as we come to Matthew 6, Jesus is going to address the topic of self-reliance,
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.220]   one of these three priorities that is guiding all of us along this new year,
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.660]   that we have surveyed and said, "That is a priority, a goal for us."
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.900]   And what we see in Matthew 6 is that Jesus is in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.460]   This is his most famous sermon recorded in all of scripture.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.100]   And as he's engaging a crowd, what we know to be true of this crowd is this crowd looks a
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.060]   lot like the people in this room.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.500]   They're people from all over the place, different backgrounds, different families,
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.180]   different histories, different reasons for even being in the room.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.420]   Jesus is engaging a group of people that look like you and me.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.860]   And this is what he says to them on the topic of self-sufficiency.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:59.580]   He says this in verse 25, Matthew 6, starting at verse 25, "Therefore,
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.100]   I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.420]   nor about your body, what you will put on.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.860]   Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?"
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.340]   Now, at first glance, can we just level with each other?
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.100]   Jesus, this feels super impractical.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.700]   Like, can we just call it like it is?
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.020]   Like, no matter where you fall on the spiritual spectrum, believer, non-believer,
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.860]   doesn't matter, this feels crazy.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.420]   He's talking about basic necessities.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:34.980]   And yet, what we need to understand is less about what Jesus is saying at first and more
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.660]   about what he isn't saying at first.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.940]   So let's talk about what Jesus is not saying right now.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:46.060]   Jesus is not saying that it's wrong to have a stable job, to engage in business and commerce
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.180]   for the purposes of making money.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.300]   He's not saying it's wrong to make preparations for future physical needs.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.900]   The reason we know that is if you read the Bible, it's loaded with so much wisdom around
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.060]   how to manage your money and invest it wisely and steward it for the purposes of God.
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.220]   Jesus is not against money.
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.660]   So if that's not what he's saying, then what does he mean right here?
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.780]   He's saying there's more to life than self-sufficiency.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.180]   He's saying there's more to life than self-sufficiency.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.660]   There's more to life than simply landing that job, earning that promotion, maxing your 401(k),
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.860]   paying your rent on time.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.540]   He's saying there's more to life than being able to do all of these things that would
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.220]   deem you self-sufficient in the eyes of the world.
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.060]   And what's interesting is he even takes it up a notch.
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.420]   Like we said a minute ago, he's talking about basic necessities, food and clothing.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.900]   Jesus, if I'm not thinking about this, then who else is going to do it?
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.340]   No one else is thinking about what I eat.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.100]   No one else is thinking about what I wear.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.540]   Jesus, this is my responsibility.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.060]   So why would he do that?
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.380]   Why would he behave so impractically?
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.100]   Because Jesus is a master storyteller.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:10.140]   And he wants to speak in extremes to turn up the drama and pull you to the edge of your
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.460]   seat so you'll listen in.
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:21.220]   You see, Jesus wants to address our preoccupation with self-sufficiency.
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.860]   And he's going to do it specifically in two ways.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.900]   The first way he's going to address our preoccupation with self-sufficiency is by talking about
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.900]   our need for control.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.500]   Anybody struggle with that?
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   This is what he says in verse 26.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.940]   Look at the birds of the air.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.620]   They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly father, he feeds
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.740]   them.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.540]   Are you not of more value than they?
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.180]   And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:58.100]   Jesus wants us to know as he talks about our preoccupation with self-sufficiency that God
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.780]   is in control so you don't have to be.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.960]   God is in control so you do not have to be.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.180]   He uses three successive verbs, verbs that build on top of each other.
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.260]   He says sow, reap, and gather, and he's speaking to an agrarian society.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:21.980]   If he were talking to us, a digitized society, he would use verbs like crop and edit and
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.220]   caption.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.220]   But he's not doing that.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.220]   He's not talking to us.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.220]   He's talking to them.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.320]   And in an agricultural world, they're thinking all of this makes sense because these are
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.800]   people that are accustomed to working the land and spreading the seed and harvesting
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   a crop.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.840]   They're accustomed to working really hard to provide for themselves.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:51.120]   And yet in their context, they understand that no matter how hard they work, what they
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:58.880]   reap will always somewhat be out of their control because there's one massive variable
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.760]   that is beyond their limit.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   Rain.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.400]   Crops need rain.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.040]   They do not grow without it.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.160]   And only one person in all the cosmos controls the rain.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.640]   God.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.120]   God.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.600]   Now, I would guess that you're probably not lying awake at night thinking to yourself,
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.440]   God, are you going to send the rain?
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.520]   But you probably are laying awake at night thinking to yourself, God, will you fix my
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.520]   family?
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.480]   God, are you going to provide for my loneliness?
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.640]   God, are you going to restore that broken friendship?
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:46.840]   God, are you going to meet me in the area that I feel hopeless and helpless to control?
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.800]   To that, Jesus is saying, God, he is powerful enough to help.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.440]   God is powerful enough to help, which begs the question, if God's powerful enough to
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.840]   help, does he even care to do it?
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.120]   To that, Jesus says, look at the birds.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.240]   Look at the birds.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.560]   Jesus points to a creature that is incapable of self-sufficiency.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.920]   I'll spare you my study of avian energy balance and thermal regulation, but what you need
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.000]   to know about birds is that they have one of the highest metabolic rates in the animal
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.440]   kingdom, which just simply means they need to eat a lot and they need to eat often.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.520]   So how do you think they're taking care of themselves?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.240]   You think they're putting in a HEB curbside pickup order and swinging through and picking
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.740]   it up on the way home?
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.800]   You think they're planting something in the garden and tealing the soil, making sure it's
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.560]   growing every single day?
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.840]   You think they're stockpiling their rations so that when a bad day comes, they've got
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.160]   some food to live on?
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.400]   No, they're birds.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.360]   Birds don't do that.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:02.640]   They're absolutely and utterly dependent upon God.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.460]   They know God will take care of them.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.040]   God feeds them.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.680]   He will meet their needs.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   He controls what they cannot.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:20.720]   Are you not of more value than they?
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.280]   Psalm 8, it says this, "When I look at the heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.720]   and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you're mindful of him?
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.880]   And the son of man that you care for?
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.400]   Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and you've crowned him
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.920]   with glory and honor."
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.240]   Friends, has it ever occurred to you that God is mindful of you?
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.640]   That you're actually on his mind?
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.900]   That he's actually thinking about you?
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.440]   That his thoughts are filled with you, flooded with you?
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.600]   Has that ever occurred to you?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.080]   Because it occurred to David.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.920]   Like David's writing this psalm, standing in the midst of a field, looking up at the
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.520]   night sky with a far weaker grasp of how big the universe is, and yet he still feels infinitely
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.280]   small and knows, "God, you see me.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.240]   You see me, God.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.320]   And not only do you see me, Lord, you crown me with glory and honor.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.400]   Like God, you not only see me, but you like what you see."
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.040]   Do you think God likes what he sees when he sees you?
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.080]   Jesus would say he does.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.800]   Jesus, he gives God this unique title that the Gospel of Matthew reserves for only three
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:43.280]   usages over the course of its entire narrative, and it's the title Heavenly Father.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.320]   What's significant about Heavenly Father is it talks about God in a way that's pretty
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.460]   juxtapositional.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:56.560]   It says that God is both powerful, heavenly, and yet personal, Father.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.840]   He's God up there, and he's God right here.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.880]   God, he does see you, and he likes what he sees.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.760]   Now, am I saying that God, because he likes what he sees, he's going to give you everything
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.920]   that you want?
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.080]   That would make him a bad father.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.160]   He will not give you everything you want, but he will give you everything you need.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.680]   He always will.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.320]   This is God's heart for you.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.760]   God wants to give you what you need.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.200]   And Porch, listen to me.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.880]   If you never come back, then you need know this for me tonight.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:38.920]   What you need most of is more of him.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.880]   You need more of God.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.640]   That's the thing that you need most of all.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.380]   So let me ask you, why are you worried?
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.380]   Why are you worried?
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.280]   Jesus says all that stress, it won't do you any good.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.720]   Jesus says it cannot even add a single hour to the span of your life.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:03.240]   For some perspective, NPR reports that the average human life is 76.4 years long.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.680]   In hours, that equals 669,722 hours.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.240]   And no matter how much you worry or sweat or stress over it, you're not going to add
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.700]   even one.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.940]   Only God can make the difference.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.440]   Only God can make the difference.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:27.460]   You can't add a single hour to your life, and yet God, God can add an infinite number
[00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.800]   of hours and years to your life.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.720]   Like you can't do anything to buy yourself tomorrow, but God can buy you a million tomorrows
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.960]   and forevermore.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.440]   God is the one that makes the difference, not you.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.940]   And that's such good news to us, Porch.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.300]   He's the one that can do it.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:54.540]   For those of us that are in need of control, as well as those of us that have a deep need
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.600]   for acceptance, which is where he goes next.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.240]   In verse 28, he says, "And why are you anxious about clothing?
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.320]   Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.760]   They neither toil nor spin.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.540]   Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:14.180]   But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.660]   into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:26.460]   See God's not only in control, but also God gives greater approval than anyone else.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:31.020]   God gives greater approval than anyone else.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:39.900]   So when I was in college, I remember learning the craft of perfecting the ultimate resume.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.820]   I learned how to create the perfect resume as I applied for different jobs.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:49.500]   And I got so good at it that they gave me a job helping other people do it.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.700]   Let me just say, I'm not in that line of work anymore.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.300]   So if you need a resume, you're going to have to check somewhere else.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.580]   Save the email.
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:57.820]   But I knew it, man.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.180]   I knew what to do.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:03.580]   Like I had a grasp on all the strategies and tools you could implement to create the perfect
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.580]   resume.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:11.020]   I knew font styles and formatting and proven metrics and action verbs that you could employ
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.780]   to make your resume look everything the bit of what an employer would want.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.980]   You see, I had become a master of self-promotion.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.660]   But the one thing I always could, I struggled to ever wrap my mind around as I thought about
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:29.260]   making resumes was why does it have to fit on one page?
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.260]   Can I get an amen?
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.700]   Trying to put all of your credentials on one page just did not feel feasible.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.300]   And yet here's why it was so crazy for me.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:45.420]   It's not because one page of a resume could surely contain all of my awesomeness.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:55.300]   It's because one page of a resume surely was not enough to impress anyone.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:01.140]   In the same way, many of us don't think that who we really genuinely are is enough to impress
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.980]   anyone.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.260]   So what do we do?
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.320]   We clothe ourselves.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.480]   We clothe ourselves.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.260]   We want to impress physically, socially, intellectually, professionally.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:18.500]   And so we wrap ourselves in high-power corporate jobs, a fancy photo on social media, a name
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.820]   brand, books in philosophy, a new experience, a good reputation, lots of impressive works.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:29.260]   This is what we do because we're actually convinced that if the world saw what was inwardly
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:34.520]   true, they would outwardly reject us.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.260]   And so we put on a mask and we pray to God that this mask would be enough to convince
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:47.540]   all of these people that I'm acceptable, lest they ever look underneath it and reject me
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.700]   forever.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.400]   This is the story for so many young adults.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:25:05.540]   We use the opinions of other people to tell us whether or not our approval is legitimate.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.860]   To this, Jesus says, "Consider the lilies."
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.060]   Take a look at the lilies.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:17.340]   So just to paint the picture, here Jesus is, crowd is sitting across the hillside beside
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:26.580]   the Sea of Galilee, and smattered amongst them are wildflowers in bloom, red and purple
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:35.040]   anemones with 10-inch crowning stalks and blue irises, the very colors of King David
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.800]   and King Solomon's own robes.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:46.040]   And as Jesus points to them, he references flowers because flowers don't choose to be
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:52.120]   the color they are or aspire to grow taller than they should.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:26:00.840]   They just trust God to grow them as he means for them to be.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.640]   What are the results of that, of that kind of trust, of that sort of dependence?
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.000]   Beauty.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.400]   Flowers are beautiful.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:19.840]   That's why the floral industry sees its highest, its highest sales volume, delivery volume
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.720]   at Valentine's Day.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:29.460]   It's because people register with the fact that flowers, as God has made them, are beautiful.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.040]   And they communicate approval when given to others.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:39.880]   Friends, some of you have come here tonight, and if we can just level, you're desperately
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.640]   trying to be something you aren't.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.840]   The world has said that you have something in short supply.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.540]   You're not smart enough, skinny enough, pretty enough, funny enough.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.800]   You're not enough, period.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.920]   Whatever it may be for you, and so you're adding to yourself to make up the difference.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.160]   But here's the irony.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:05.240]   When we try to make up for some deficiency we feel, we do things that actually do not
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:11.800]   increase our sense of self-worth, but diminish our sense of self-worth.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.360]   We want to add to our self-love, and so you know what we do?
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.240]   We give ourselves away sexually.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:25.040]   We want to be accepted, and so what we do is we compromise ourselves morally.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.080]   We want to feel alive, and so we hurt ourselves physically.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   We want so badly to increase our sense of self-worth, and so we do things that work
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   to the contrary.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.380]   Friends, I'm not so naive as to stand here in front of you and know that there are some
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:57.760]   of you here tonight that have walked in and you feel unseen, unloved, unengaged, unvalued.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.280]   I want you to know God has not made you to feel that way.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.840]   Man has made you to feel that way.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:09.900]   The world has made you to feel that way, because the scriptures are clear.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.280]   God is not against us.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.760]   God is for us.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.280]   God is one that wonderfully clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and it's
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.840]   gone tomorrow.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.280]   Will he not much more wonderfully clothe you?
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.840]   Isaiah 6110 says this, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.760]   My soul shall exult in my God, for he has clothed me with garments of salvation.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.940]   He has covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decks himself with a priest
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.120]   with a beautiful headdress, and as a bride adorns herself with jewels."
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.000]   Look at what degree God has already approved of us.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.160]   God hasn't just looked at you and been like, "Looking sharp, man."
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.440]   He hasn't just looked at you and been like, "Hey, that was a great joke."
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:01.160]   He's not just approving of circumstantial descriptors in your life.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.720]   What God is doing is he's looking at you and he's saying, "Hey, in fact, you're so worthy
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:12.560]   of my—I want to approve of you so much that I will save you."
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:19.200]   God doesn't move in with—God doesn't send Jesus to save us from our sin when we're beautiful.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.520]   He does it when we're broken.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.640]   That's the point of Jesus showing up.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.240]   It's a demonstration of the approval of God when we did nothing to deserve it.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.040]   You didn't clean yourself up.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.540]   You didn't polish your resume.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.540]   You did nothing.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:41.320]   And yet God, he moved into the neighborhood and he saw you and he said, "I want you anyways.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.880]   I approve of you.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.400]   I will make you something you could never be on your own.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.020]   I will clothe you with garments of salvation and righteousness."
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.960]   This is the approval of God that's available to you.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.720]   So why is it that you're looking elsewhere for approval?
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:07.440]   Our self-sufficiency will not produce the kind of approval that God can.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:12.000]   And when we believe it, it frees us to something better, which is what Jesus says last.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.880]   In verses 31 through 33, he says, "Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.120]   eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.600]   For the Gentiles, they seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.680]   you need them.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:30.120]   But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all of these things will
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   be added to you."
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:39.360]   Friends, here at the beginning of the new year, the start of 2024, Jesus wants you to
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.100]   know this, that your goal shouldn't be self-sufficiency, but self-surrender.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.920]   Your goal should not be self-sufficiency.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.800]   That's out.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.800]   Your goal should be self-surrender, because that's what he's come to bring in.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:01.880]   He wants you to know that self-surrender is the way to life and life to the full.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:07.960]   I remember, as just a sophomore in college, I was desperate to prove myself to other people.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:14.900]   I wanted so bad to measure up and to garner the approval of those that were around me.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:20.000]   And yet as a sophomore, I laid awake at night in my bed, riddled with so much insecurity
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.360]   at the fact that it was not working.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.640]   I tried everything.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.000]   I compromised my decision-making.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.160]   I chose to put on a facade and act as someone I was not.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.720]   I did so many things trying to garner the approval and acceptance of people around me,
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.800]   trying to control my circumstances and arrive at my intended end.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:49.040]   And I laid awake at night, I still remember it to this day, riddled with the fact that
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.600]   it's all a failure.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.580]   I've tried and I've fallen short.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.400]   And so in that moment, I could not go to bed.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.880]   I laid there and I laid there and I laid there and I just could not bring myself to go to
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   sleep.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.760]   And so I got up out of bed and I went and I was like, "Fine, God, like you want to talk?
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.040]   You're going to keep me up all night?
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.560]   Let's go visit."
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.360]   And so I did something for the very first time that I'd never done before.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.080]   I got on my hands and knees and I started to pray.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.720]   And as I started praying to him, I just told him, I was like, "God, I want my life to count.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.660]   I want my life to be meaningful, to make a difference.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.000]   Does anybody feel that way in here?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.240]   That's not a bad prayer, but for some reason my plans were not working out.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.760]   And so God, what do you want me to do?
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   What is it, God, that you want me to pursue in life?
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.080]   Because my pursuit is clearly not working out.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.400]   Just tell me, like, just let me know.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   I'm listening.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   I'll wait for you."
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.680]   And so there I was on my hands and knees for the very first time, begging to heaven to
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.000]   give me some words, some voice, some clarity on what it was that I was supposed to do.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   You know what I heard?
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.680]   Nothing.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.160]   I heard nothing, which felt absolutely consistent with everything that God had been doing in
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.160]   my life up until that point.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.440]   It's like, "God, I feel like I've been fending for myself out here.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.200]   So if you're not going to do anything, then won't you at least let me make my way the
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.760]   way that I want to go?"
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:26.360]   And so in desperation, I got up off of my knees and I turned over to my phone and I
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.320]   picked it up off of my bed.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.440]   And I just looked at the date and the time.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.760]   It said April 16th and it was 1 11 in the morning.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.280]   And so I decided in that moment, like grasping for straws, desperate to hear the voice of
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.640]   God that I would count 16 books into the New Testament.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.200]   April 16th, 16 books in the New Testament.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.480]   I can't count 16 books into the Old Testament.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.400]   So maybe God's going to speak to me in the New Testament.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   So I counted 16 books into the New Testament and I found myself at Second Timothy and it
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.080]   was 1 11 in the morning.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.920]   And so I read Second Timothy 1 11.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.480]   And to my prayer that God would tell me what to do with my life, he said, "In this gospel,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.440]   I was appointed a herald, an apostle, and a teacher."
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.360]   It's crazy to think that that method actually worked.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:19.080]   I wouldn't recommend it to you.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.560]   And yet God in his kindness met me there.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.280]   God wanted me to know, "I do have plans for you, but they do not accord with your self-sufficiency.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.480]   They accord with your self-surrender.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.380]   When you actually give yourself over to me, I will appoint your steps and I will take
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.200]   you further than you could ever go on your own."
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.440]   I surrendered and it changed everything for me that night.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   This is how surrender is defined.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.880]   It's the action of yielding one's person or giving up the possession of something into
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.240]   the power of another person.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.360]   And for the Christian, surrender is not a one-time act.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.840]   Surrender is a daily decision to seek after God's kingdom and not seek after your own.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:07.400]   It's a daily decision to throw in the towel, to lay down your arms, to raise the white
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:12.360]   flag, to put your hands up in acknowledgement of the fact that I've been overcome.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.960]   I've been conquered.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.880]   My way doesn't work anymore.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.160]   God's way is the only way which I will walk.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.200]   This is what it means to surrender.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.560]   And what we know is that it changes a person.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   That as a person surrenders their life, it unlocks everything.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.680]   It leads you into deeper joy, fuller life.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.960]   May not mean pleasant circumstances, but it will mean proximity to the God in control
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   of those circumstances.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.520]   Jesus later in the Gospel of Matthew, he says this in chapter 16, 24 through 26, "Then Jesus
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.840]   told his disciples, those that were following him, 'If anyone would come after me, let him
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.360]   deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.040]   For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.520]   will find it.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.040]   For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?'"
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.560]   What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.720]   Porch, listen to me.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:22.300]   If you want to find your life, you will find it by losing it.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:29.400]   If you want to find your life, you will find it by losing it, by laying it down, by seeking
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.940]   his kingdom, not your own, his righteousness, not your own, by saying, "Jesus, your way
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:35.940]   is better."
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:41.740]   And if you walk in that direction, what you'll find is the life that you'd always hoped and
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.940]   dreamt and laid awake at night wanting for.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:49.760]   This is what Jesus has in store, and this is the way of the kingdom.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.480]   Like doing this looks like walking in a way that you have enough security that you can
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.880]   put coworkers before you.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:00.860]   It's walking in a way where you have enough patience that you can love that person that
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.000]   just always seems to annoy you.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.780]   It's walking in a way that actually celebrates the successes of other people, despite the
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.640]   fact that you feel stuck and unseen in your job.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.200]   This is what it means to walk in the kingdom, to seek the way of Jesus.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:30.320]   It's to lay aside your survival instincts and take up your serving instincts.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.540]   And the reason we know that this is the case, that the kingdom is one where we surrender
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:41.300]   our own interests for the sake of Christ's, is that Jesus himself surrendered his interests
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.340]   for the sake of ours.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:50.300]   You know, when Brooke and I were on that date that day, it occurred to me towards the end
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:57.340]   of our time climbing that rock wall that what mattered to me was not so much the path I
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:04.160]   chose to climb, how I intended to navigate the wall, what goals I would reach.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.140]   That didn't matter as much.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:16.500]   I realized by the end of the day that it mattered less how I climbed, it mattered more who I
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:19.000]   climbed alongside.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.140]   I realized that my goal wasn't to achieve all of these trinkets and toys, but my goal
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:32.580]   was to simply enjoy the one that was there beside me.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:37.860]   Clearly it worked because she's here with me tonight.
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:45.620]   But I tell you that because I just want you to know that for some of us here tonight,
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.780]   our goals need to shift too.
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.300]   Our perspective needs to change.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:56.820]   We need to awaken to the reality that what matters most is not how we navigate this year,
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.660]   but who we navigate this year with.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:04.740]   Friends, the goal of your life is not to seek self-sufficiency.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.940]   It's not to seek your kingdom.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.900]   It's to seek his kingdom.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:15.340]   And the reason we seek after his kingdom is because the king sought after us first.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:21.860]   You see, what's fascinating is Jesus trusted that God was in control and it gave him the
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:29.780]   confidence to live his life in a way where he could be perfect, where you and I had only
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.340]   ever and always been imperfect.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.980]   What we see in Jesus is one that knew God gives greater approval than anyone else.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:45.420]   And so rather than seeing people as objects to serve him, he saw them as subjects to serve
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.420]   and love instead.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.860]   And what we see in Jesus is that his goal was not self-sufficiency.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.900]   His goal was self-surrender.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.660]   So much to the point that he surrendered his own life voluntarily upon the cross.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:03.380]   And he hung himself upon a Roman execution rack.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:11.420]   And in doing so, he absorbed the punishment of all our sins into himself.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:16.860]   But Jesus knows the way of the kingdom and he's inviting us to walk with him that direction
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.820]   this year.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:24.420]   And the reason that invitation is real tonight is though Jesus did surrender himself, he
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.100]   took up his life and he rose forth from the grave.
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:35.860]   And in rising from the grave, he did declare, "I am the king that's brought the kingdom
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:42.540]   whom all that would place their faith in me can be a part of."
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:48.220]   Porch, do you know the king?
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:55.620]   For the king, King Jesus, you were his first priority.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.820]   And so here's what I want you to know.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:07.500]   As you step into 2024, seek first the kingdom.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:13.460]   For in doing so, you will find the king himself.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:19.460]   Let me pray for us.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:45.860]   Father, there are so many agendas in the room, so many plans, so many pursuits.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:57.020]   And yet God, your word declares as true, not a suggestion, not an idea, but as true that
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:08.820]   there is only one pursuit worthy of seeking, and it's you.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:23.180]   Jesus, I pray that tonight, in these next moments, plans would be laid aside, priorities,
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:29.660]   God, would begin to shift, goals, God, would be exchanged for your will in the lives of
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:42.540]   these young people, and that God, as all of it is done, what would be found on the other
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:49.660]   side is deep, abiding joy.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:55.180]   God, there's no one like you.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.100]   There's none like you, Lord.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:04.060]   It doesn't matter, God, who we are, where we are, how we are, God, we will never find
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.140]   one that can stand next to you.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.460]   Can God compare against you?
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:15.100]   Your matchless God, both in times past, here, God, in our present, and forever, Father,
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:22.020]   in the future, you, God, are the one and only worthy of all our worship, worthy, God, of
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:23.020]   all our pursuit.
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:28.820]   And I pray, Lord, that tonight we would register with that, that we would come to grips with
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:36.740]   the truth, God, that you are as good as you say you are, and that any other pursuit, God,
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:42.540]   that we may be seeking after, Lord, instead, all those things are our counterfeit gods
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.660]   wanting for our worship, God.
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:50.660]   Tonight, the one true living God, the resurrected Jesus is here, and he is made known.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:54.500]   I, and I alone, am worthy of your worship.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.620]   Would we sing to you, God?
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:02.140]   Would we make space here in these next moments for you to move, God, amongst us, within us,
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.140]   Lord?
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.140]   Would we respond?
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:08.500]   Like, God, would this not just be a moment where we walk in and we get a dose of information,
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.660]   a dose of inspiration?
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:15.580]   God, would this be a moment where we get a dose of fascination, captivation, God?
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.360]   Would we come close to you and it changes everything for us, God?
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:28.220]   Not just tonight, not just tomorrow, not just this year, but God, forever.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:34.860]   And so, God, we give you the space here now, not because you need our permission, but God,
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:40.780]   simply as a testament to say we're wanting for you, God, willing to go where you wish.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:46.580]   Would this be a moment of humble surrender where, God, we lay aside ourselves and we
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.580]   follow you instead?
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.580]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.640]   you
