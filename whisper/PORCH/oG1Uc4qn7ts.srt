1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,620
 - Ports, how we doing?

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,880
 (congregation cheering)

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,360
 Come on, come on.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,080
 Man, I love worshiping with a band.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,200
 I don't know where you're at, Fort Worth or Houston

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,720
 or wherever you're gathering.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,200
 I hope, hopefully you just were able to worship the Lord

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,560
 through some gifted musicians.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,400
 Can we just thank the band who point us to Jesus?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,560
 (congregation cheering)

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,440
 It's awesome, man.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,960
 It is awesome to be pointed to our creator with those guys.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,760
 Anybody here in a band?

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,920
 Like those guys are so cool.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,520
 I mean, they're in band.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,980
 I was in band like when it wasn't so cool to be in band.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,820
 Anybody else?

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,640
 Anybody else in band?

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,960
 Like that you're proud of it?

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
 Like, yeah, yeah.

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,680
 No, you don't have to do this, do this.

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,020
 It's like, yeah, I was in band.

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,920
 Yeah, yeah.

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,760
 What'd you play?

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,200
 - Percussion.

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,420
 - Trumpet, percussion.

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,880
 I played percussion.

29
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,880
 That's just a fancy way to say drums.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,040
 I wanted to be like those guys who played the quads.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,080
 You know, anybody who, you know, those guys.

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,920
 I went and I got my snare drum and go and you get it.

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,820
 And there I was in sixth grade.

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,840
 I had my snare drum and I was so excited about it.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,760
 And I don't wanna brag,

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,920
 but for the first couple of weeks,

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,880
 I was first chair every week.

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
 No big deal.

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,960
 Don't treat me different, okay?

40
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,020
 (congregation laughing)

41
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,880
 Just a normal guy, first chair.

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,360
 And I remember my sister loved Metallica.

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
 And she was my older sister.

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,120
 She loved Metallica.

45
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,920
 Metallica's drummer was so amazing.

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,740
 His name was Lars.

47
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,880
 He would just go off on the kit.

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,800
 And that's what I thought I was gonna be like.

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,720
 So I signed up for band in the sixth grade.

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,320
 Well, then we go to competition and they put me,

51
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,920
 I heard one of you, you shout it like the triangle, okay?

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,000
 Like that was my role in the competition.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,820
 All these guys were doing all this crazy stuff

54
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,620
 on the drums and I was like, ding, you know?

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,280
 Hit some blocks or something.

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,440
 And so it was, you know, as the next two years,

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,320
 I was in band, the next two years progressed.

58
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,200
 Here's what happened.

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
 I started out first chair.

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,360
 First chair, if you weren't in band,

61
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,000
 that's just a really good thing.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,040
 And then as the weeks went on, the next 24 months went on,

63
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,440
 I moved to middle chair.

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,520
 And then that kind of next year, I sat in last chair

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,880
 and I stayed there and I never moved on.

66
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
 Here's why.

67
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,240
 I learned I'm not real passionate about the drums.

68
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,600
 And because I wasn't super passionate about the drums,

69
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,400
 I didn't practice like some of my peers did.

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,500
 Like they were passionate.

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,440
 They went home, they practiced every night.

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,100
 They disciplined themselves.

73
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,640
 They moved on to other percussion instruments.

74
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,960
 I sat there with the triangle in my last chair

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,500
 because my passion for the drums was waning.

76
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,360
 You know, I don't know if you know

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
 what they're saying about us.

78
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,560
 The reason I start with that story

79
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,400
 is because what they're saying

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,720
 is that if we're not passionate about something,

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,560
 then we don't apply ourselves to it.

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
 That's what they're saying about our generation.

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,520
 I don't know what you think about that.

84
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,280
 You can take that and be insulted

85
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,480
 or you can inspect your life and ask, is it true?

86
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,520
 Is that something that marks me?

87
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,440
 Is that something that's true for me?

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,400
 I can remember thinking when I was playing the drums

89
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,040
 is man, this is hard.

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,160
 It doesn't feel natural.

91
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,760
 And if it doesn't come natural and it seems difficult,

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
 it must not be right.

93
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,480
 Maybe you start questioning yourself.

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,460
 Maybe I wasn't made to do this.

95
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,840
 If I'm not great at it, it must not be my thing.

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
 Did you know that only 1% of people

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,760
 are naturally, extraordinarily gifted at something?

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,280
 Less than 1% actually.

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,160
 Think genius, think savant.

100
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
 Think like be able to step up to a piano

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,240
 for the first time and play it by ear.

102
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,960
 Less than 1% of people.

103
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,400
 Do you know what that means for us,

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,040
 the other 99 plus percent of people?

105
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,580
 If we're going to do anything great in this life,

106
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,840
 it is going to require discipline.

107
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,080
 That's the truth.

108
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,320
 If you are going to accomplish anything extraordinary

109
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,240
 with the days the Lord has trusted to you on this planet,

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,600
 it is going to require you pushing through the discomfort

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
 and embracing the grind and disciplining yourself.

112
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,420
 And so we're in this series, Vice and Virtue.

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,680
 And tonight we're talking about laziness and discipline.

114
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,320
 Laziness and discipline.

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,280
 Laziness is simply the lack of discipline.

116
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,340
 I'd ask you right now, do you think you're lazy?

117
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,320
 Most of us don't think we're lazy.

118
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,840
 How many of you hope to wake up this morning

119
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,280
 to look out the window and see a blanket of white snow?

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,280
 Yeah, me too, me too.

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,520
 I was excited about that.

122
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,920
 Now I'm glad I'm not the only one.

123
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,960
 And why?

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,560
 Because you wanted to stay home.

126
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,560
 You went to bed last night hoping

127
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,640
 that work would be canceled today.

128
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,480
 Are you lazy?

129
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,960
 How many of you made New Year's resolutions?

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,280
 They say 40%.

131
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,680
 40% of us made New Year's resolutions.

132
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,440
 Just for comparison, 33% of us watched the Super Bowl.

133
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,280
 40% of us made New Year's resolutions.

134
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,120
 What were they?

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,200
 They were around disciplines.

136
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,800
 I'll give you some of the five most popular ones.

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
 Be disciplined to lose weight.

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,000
 Be disciplined to exercise more.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,200
 Be disciplined to eat healthier.

140
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,360
 Get a better job.

141
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,280
 Get closer to God actually made the list.

142
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,280
 And did you know that January 12th is National Quitters Day?

143
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,840
 (congregation laughing)

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
 That is where statistically most people

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 stop their New Year's resolutions.

146
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,920
 We make it into the year 12 days.

147
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,960
 Now I don't know where you're at in that journey,

148
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,720
 but they say 8% of people keep their resolutions.

149
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,720
 92% of Americans stop.

150
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,960
 Why?

151
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,920
 Because we're lazy.

152
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,720
 Because we're lazy.

153
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,720
 And some of us have even a work to be lazy mentality.

154
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,440
 I know you don't think you're lazy because you're busy.

155
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,560
 And what I want you to know is just because you're busy

156
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
 doesn't mean you're not lazy.

157
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,640
 The Proverbs actually speak to this idea

158
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,920
 that we can be doing a lot of things but not progressing,

159
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
 not doing something productive.

160
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,600
 Our life not producing anything great.

161
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
 We're just busy.

162
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,880
 You've heard of crazy busy.

163
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,720
 I'm talking about lazy busy.

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,240
 That we would sit in a bunch of motion.

165
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,280
 That we would create a lot of energy,

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,800
 but there would be no productivity.

167
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,240
 See, some of us have a work to be lazy mentality.

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,640
 We go to work on Monday, waiting for Friday,

169
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,400
 drudging through the week,

170
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,520
 hoping to get to that finish line

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,720
 so we can kick up our feet and take it easy.

172
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,400
 And if you don't believe me on that week to week basis,

173
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
 just think about retirement.

174
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,240
 Like some of us just think,

175
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,440
 hey, we're gonna work hard when we're young,

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,720
 hope to make a lot of money, store it up in a 401k,

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,080
 and then kick up our feet and take it easy.

178
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,360
 Our goal, our literal goal in life is to be lazy.

179
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,920
 That's what we hope to accomplish with our life

180
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,940
 is to one day be able to afford to be lazy.

181
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,240
 Are we lazy?

182
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,420
 Are we lazy?

183
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:56,760
 If you're not convinced, I want to turn to the Proverbs.

184
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,280
 It's in the Old Testament.

185
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,600
 It's a book written by kings,

186
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,960
 most of mostly the King Solomon,

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,840
 the wisest man who ever lived.

188
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,840
 It's the book of wisdom.

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,720
 It's principles for us to live our life by.

190
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,600
 And in the book of Proverbs, there's lots of characters.

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,400
 You have a lady wisdom, the wise.

192
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,760
 You have the fool.

193
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,040
 You have the characters of the scoffers.

194
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
 You have the isolated man.

195
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,560
 You have the noble woman of Proverbs 31.

196
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,960
 You have those who are wise in their eyes.

197
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
 And then you get to the one that we're gonna look at

198
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,680
 this evening called the sluggard.

199
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,720
 When you hear me say sluggard, think lazy person.

200
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
 The Proverbs talks about this character

201
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,960
 about a dozen times.

202
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,380
 We'll address most of them.

203
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,440
 I'm gonna jump around, but let me start here in Proverbs 26

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,540
 so I can continue to ask the questions.

205
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,000
 As we move through the Proverbs,

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,220
 we're gonna look at the topic of laziness, three things.

207
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,100
 The cause of laziness, the cost of laziness,

208
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,040
 what it costs you, 'cause the cost is high.

209
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,560
 And then before you leave here this evening,

210
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,920
 the cure for laziness from the Proverbs.

211
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,800
 So we'll start in here in Proverbs 26.

212
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
 It says this in verse 13.

213
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,440
 A sluggard says, "There's a lion in the road,

214
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,280
 "a fierce lion roaming the streets."

215
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,560
 Now what does that mean?

216
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,920
 The lazy person says there's a lion in the road.

217
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,960
 It's a riddle.

218
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,160
 Sometimes these proverbial sayings or riddles

219
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,160
 is saying that a lazy person will make any excuse

220
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,720
 not to go to work.

221
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,800
 There's a lion in the road.

222
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
 There's ice in the road.

223
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
 There's ice in the streets.

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
 I can't go.

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,320
 What is your excuse?

226
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,140
 I'm just not passionate about my work, man.

227
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,680
 I don't believe in the product.

228
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,400
 My boss is a jerk.

229
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,560
 They don't give me enough vacation.

230
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,240
 They don't pay me enough.

231
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,360
 I think I was made for something different.

232
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,280
 And then verse 14, it says,

233
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
 "As the door turns on its hinges,

234
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,360
 "so a slugger turns on his bed."

235
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,680
 What does this mean?

236
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,640
 Again, it's a riddle.

237
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
 What does a door hinge do?

238
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 It moves a lot but goes nowhere.

239
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,460
 Lots of movement but it doesn't do anything.

240
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,380
 The slugger turns on his bed.

241
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
 You can picture the person laying on their bed,

242
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,900
 rolling over and hitting the snooze button

243
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,300
 again and again and again.

244
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,140
 Did you know that if you hit,

245
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,580
 anybody snooze button?

246
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,740
 Who snooze this morning?

247
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,100
 Okay, you're proud of that.

248
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,380
 Did you know that if you hit the snooze button

249
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,820
 for 15 minutes, just 15 minutes a day,

250
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,700
 if you snooze for just 15 minutes a day,

251
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,900
 that's 92 hours a year.

252
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,440
 That's four whole days of sleep

253
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,400
 at the end of a year.

254
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,880
 That's you not getting out of bed

255
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,420
 for four whole 24-hour days.

256
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,820
 Just hitting the snooze button once, 15 minutes.

257
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,460
 Like a door hinge, not going anywhere.

258
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,160
 "A slugger buries his hand in the dish.

259
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,380
 "He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth."

260
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,240
 What does that mean?

261
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
 It's a riddle.

262
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,620
 It means they don't finish what they start.

263
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,140
 They don't finish what they start.

264
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,540
 I tell my kids they can play any sport they wanna play,

265
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,740
 but if we start it, they're gonna finish it.

266
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,860
 My daughter this year started playing basketball,

267
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,440
 and before her first game,

268
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,820
 she broke her finger in two places.

269
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,680
 Doctor said she couldn't play basketball.

270
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,140
 She's thinking, "Oh, season's over.

271
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,340
 "I'm just not gonna be on the team."

272
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,060
 No, no, no, we're gonna go to every game

273
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,340
 because you signed up to play.

274
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,540
 We're gonna finish.

275
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,520
 You're gonna sit on the sidelines.

276
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,420
 You're gonna cheer on your team.

277
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,260
 You're gonna sit with your team.

278
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,100
 You're gonna cheer them on.

279
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,340
 "A slugger is wiser in his own eyes

280
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,860
 "than seven people who answer discreetly."

281
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,340
 A slugger says, "I work hard, not smart.

282
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,860
 "I mean, I work smart, not hard."

283
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,640
 Like a pro will show you they're a pro by what they do.

284
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,580
 A slugger, a lazy person says,

285
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,220
 "Hey, they're always a coach, never a player.

286
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,460
 "Hey, I know everything about everything.

287
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,300
 "I've done these things.

288
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,120
 "Hey, sit back.

289
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
 "Let me tell you how to do it.

290
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,100
 "Let me tell you how good I am.

291
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,120
 "Don't make me show you, though.

292
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,060
 "Don't make me get up from the couch."

293
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,620
 And so let's just ask some questions

294
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,340
 before we dive in further.

295
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,660
 Let's ask some questions from these texts.

296
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,180
 Verse 13, "Do we make excuses to get out of discipline?

297
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,460
 "I can't go to work today because,

298
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,920
 "I'm hitting snooze because,

299
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,720
 "I can't spend time with God this morning.

300
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,560
 "I'll do it later.

301
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,380
 "I'll do it this evening.

302
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,960
 "I'll do it before I go to bed."

303
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,540
 Verse 14, "Are we busy but lack something

304
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,780
 "to show for the busyness?"

305
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,620
 Not getting better, not getting greater,

306
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,020
 not producing something great.

307
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,940
 Do we start things but not finish them?

308
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,900
 In verse 15, "Job to job, ambition to ambition,

309
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,640
 "diet to diet, I'm gonna work out this time,

310
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,420
 "gym membership to gym membership,

311
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,700
 "hobby to hobby, no, I found the thing.

312
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,140
 "No, it's not the thing."

313
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,120
 You ever, you meet somebody, they're like,

314
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,300
 "Dude, I love my job.

315
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,500
 "I got the best job in the world.

316
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,740
 "I got a new job, it's awesome."

317
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,620
 And you talk to 'em like two months later,

318
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,580
 you're like, "Dude, how's it going?"

319
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,780
 "Oh, I quit, man, it sucked.

320
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,940
 "My job was awful."

321
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,700
 And then you see 'em again, "Oh, but I got a new job!

322
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,940
 "It's awesome!"

323
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,740
 "So great, my boss!"

324
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,220
 And then you see 'em later, "How's it going?"

325
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,420
 "Oh, got laid off."

326
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,940
 It's always something, you know?

327
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
 Thing to thing to thing.

328
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,020
 And why?

329
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,600
 Why would anybody be lazy?

330
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,820
 I think it's different than you think.

331
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,340
 Let's talk about the cause of laziness.

332
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,540
 My first point, the cause of laziness.

333
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,580
 You might be tempted to think that laziness

334
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,460
 is the lack of a desire or the lack of drive.

335
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,100
 It is not that.

336
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,140
 Laziness is an intense drive, it's an intense desire.

337
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,100
 The reason that you hoped that it would,

338
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,300
 that the roads would freeze last night

339
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,660
 is not because you don't have a desire,

340
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,860
 it's because you had a desire to what?

341
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,660
 Stay in your PJs all day, sit by a fire,

342
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,620
 and binge on Netflix.

343
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,700
 You have a desire to be comfortable.

344
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,820
 Laziness is driven by a deep desire for comfort.

345
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,300
 Let me show you from the Proverbs.

346
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,620
 Proverbs 13, verse four.

347
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,980
 "A sluggard's appetite is never filled,

348
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,740
 "but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied."

349
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,980
 In the ESV it says,

350
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,900
 "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing."

351
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,580
 Proverbs 21, verse 25, it says,

352
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,260
 "The craving of a sluggard will be death to them."

353
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,680
 They have a craving.

354
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,400
 "But his hands refuse to work.

355
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,240
 "All day long he craves for more but the righteousness,

356
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,020
 "but the righteous give without sparing."

357
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,460
 What does a sluggard or lazy person crave?

358
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,580
 They crave comfort.

359
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,220
 The cause of laziness is a craving for comfort.

360
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,060
 Write that down.

361
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,060
 The cause of laziness is a craving for comfort.

362
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,260
 It's wanting comfort ultimately.

363
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,340
 Your problem is not laziness.

364
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,220
 It's the idolatry or the worship of comfort

365
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,000
 which produces laziness.

366
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,660
 It's that I don't want to do anything

367
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,260
 that I don't want to do.

368
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,700
 It's believing this lie,

369
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,340
 and this is so popular among us and our peers,

370
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,980
 believing this lie

371
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,220
 that if it doesn't come completely natural to me,

372
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,740
 if it's not easy,

373
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,940
 then I shouldn't have to do it,

374
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,020
 or maybe I'm doing the wrong thing.

375
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,220
 And the enemy, he'll convince you of that,

376
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,820
 and he'll keep you in apathy

377
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,500
 so that you never produce anything great with your life.

378
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,900
 There's a lot of examples of this.

379
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,980
 I think that the ultimate goal of the enemy

380
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,900
 is that he would just keep you in a place

381
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,940
 of doing nothing great for the kingdom,

382
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,500
 nothing great with your life,

383
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 not living your purpose.

384
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,780
 There was an anti-drug commercial in the '90s.

385
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,820
 It was called Pete's Couch.

386
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,700
 You can look it up on YouTube later.

387
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,040
 Maybe you saw it as I did.

388
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,940
 This was a season of my life where I was doing drugs.

389
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,780
 I was smoking a lot of weed at this time in my life,

390
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,580
 and so I was interested in this commercial

391
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,580
 because there were so many crazy commercials out there.

392
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,860
 This is your brain on drugs, scrambled eggs and whatnot,

393
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,980
 and that just didn't appeal to me,

394
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,380
 but this particular commercial, I was like,

395
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,140
 okay, there's some truth in that,

396
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,260
 and essentially, they were sitting on Pete's couch,

397
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,100
 and he's like, you know, and the guy starts talking.

398
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,860
 He's like, hey, I smoked weed, and nothing happened.

399
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,940
 I didn't die.

400
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,340
 I didn't do heroin.

401
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,640
 I didn't get in a wreck.

402
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,940
 Nothing happened.

403
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,900
 I smoked weed, and you know what happened?

404
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,740
 Nothing.

405
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,120
 We just sat on Pete's couch,

406
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,360
 and then it talked about how we didn't go mountain biking.

407
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
 We didn't go on a date at the ice skating rink.

408
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,900
 We didn't do anything great.

409
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,180
 We did nothing.

410
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,700
 We sat on Pete's couch.

411
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,200
 This is a great picture of laziness.

412
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,900
 What's at risk with laziness?

413
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,860
 That you would get to the end of this race,

414
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,260
 and a lot of people would stand up at your funeral,

415
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,420
 and they would talk about all the great things

416
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,320
 that you did, except there aren't any.

417
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,900
 There's nothing to say.

418
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,800
 Man, they were really good at relaxing.

419
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,780
 (congregation laughing)

420
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,620
 Taking it easy.

421
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,460
 Man, you know, I remember when they caught

422
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,360
 the whole season on Netflix, and it was awesome.

423
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,340
 And there's nothing.

424
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,100
 Don't be this person, man.

425
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,000
 You were made for so much greater than that.

426
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,220
 God made you for incredible purposes

427
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
 that the enemy wants you to miss out on.

428
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,180
 If you're here, he has a plan for you,

429
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,580
 and so let's look at the cost of laziness, right?

430
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,640
 The cost of laziness.

431
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,620
 I'm gonna give you four P words from the Proverbs.

432
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,980
 Proverbs 6, verse 11.

433
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,740
 "Poverty will come on the sluggard like a thief,

434
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,760
 "and scarcity like an armed man."

435
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,860
 One of the things that laziness will certainly cost you

436
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,420
 is prosperity.

437
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,940
 Remember when you were little, and maybe you played M*A*S*H

438
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,420
 in the third grade or something, and you thought,

439
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,240
 "Hey, when I get older, I'm gonna be rich.

440
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,540
 "We all think we're gonna be rich.

441
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,180
 "We all think we're gonna be millionaires."

442
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,780
 And you get here, and you realize the only way

443
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,460
 you're really going to be rich

444
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,340
 is if you work really, really hard.

445
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,860
 Maybe you were born into it.

446
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,340
 Probably you're like the rest of us,

447
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,180
 and you're going to have to work really, really hard.

448
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,980
 You're gonna have to discipline yourself.

449
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,780
 Laziness will cost you prosperity.

450
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,020
 It says, "Lazy people do not plow in season,

451
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,220
 "so at harvest time, they look but find nothing."

452
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,020
 It's Proverbs 20, verse four.

453
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,140
 "Laziness costs you progress."

454
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,620
 You won't go anywhere.

455
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,260
 You won't have anything to show for your work.

456
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,900
 It's like a door hinge.

457
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,580
 You're lazy, busy, lots of motion, nothing to show for it.

458
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,900
 You cannot have any tremendous output

459
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,760
 without the input of hard work and discipline.

460
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,620
 That's just a fact of life.

461
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,740
 That's what's called the law of the harvest.

462
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,220
 Proverbs 10, verse 26, "As vinegar to the teeth

463
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,140
 "and smoke to the eyes, so are sluggards

464
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,260
 "to those who send them."

465
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,200
 It's saying, "Hey, these sluggards, these lazy people,

466
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,980
 "they cause frustration to those they work for.

467
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,260
 "They're bitter like vinegar."

468
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,460
 Or you don't wanna be around 'em,

469
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,420
 you don't wanna look at 'em like smoke to the eyes.

470
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:51,420
 Laziness costs you people's trust or reputation.

471
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,460
 But I think the greatest risk, friends,

472
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,640
 is laziness costs you your purpose.

473
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,420
 Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are God's workmanship.

474
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,220
 "We are his masterpiece."

475
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,580
 That's a beautiful thing.

476
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,860
 Just stop for a second to think about that.

477
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,500
 That there's a God, he's an artist, he's a creator.

478
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,860
 He created you.

479
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,700
 He made your ears the way they are,

480
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,820
 your nose the way it is.

481
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,700
 He gave your eyes the color they are.

482
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,360
 He gave you some talents, some skills.

483
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,220
 Some of you are fast, he made you that way.

484
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,740
 "For we are God's workmanship,

485
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,220
 "created in Christ Jesus to do good works,

486
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,860
 "which he prepared in advance for us to do."

487
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,020
 We were created for what?

488
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,380
 To do good works.

489
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,300
 That God, the creator, prepared in advance

490
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,780
 for you to walk in, that that's your purpose.

491
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,740
 But if you waste your days here pursuing comforts,

492
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,980
 then you miss out on your purpose.

493
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,960
 And you don't walk through the good works

494
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,180
 which God prepared for you to walk through.

495
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,260
 You stay on Pete's couch.

496
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,000
 And your life passes you by.

497
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,180
 See, laziness is feeding your comfort.

498
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,740
 It's not doing anything unless you feel like it.

499
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,320
 But Christ, he calls us to a different message.

500
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,780
 He calls us to embrace discomfort.

501
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,300
 He says in Luke 9 and also Matthew 16,

502
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,940
 Jesus says to them, "Whoever wants to be my disciple,"

503
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,780
 anybody wanna be his disciple?

504
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,780
 "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves."

505
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,820
 What that means is must deny themselves comfort,

506
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,500
 must not just feed their appetites,

507
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,740
 must not just do what they wanna do.

508
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,020
 They must deny themselves and take up their cross daily

509
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,300
 and follow me.

510
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,340
 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it,

511
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,020
 but whoever loses their life for me will save it.

512
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,140
 The cost of laziness is not carrying your cross.

513
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,280
 The cost of laziness is a wasted life.

514
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,300
 The cost of laziness is a wasted life.

515
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,780
 That's what's at risk, a wasted life.

516
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,340
 You won't grow.

517
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,220
 You won't get better.

518
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,860
 You won't be great at anything.

519
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,660
 My wife and I, we have three kids.

520
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,300
 Our son is five.

521
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,620
 His name is Weston.

522
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,780
 He's been coming in our room at night,

523
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,140
 like in the middle of the night,

524
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,680
 like last night at three in the morning,

525
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,660
 which is a terrifying thing to wake up

526
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,700
 and have a five-year-old staring at you.

527
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,740
 (congregation laughing)

528
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,620
 And he's moaning and crying.

529
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,540
 And he's not sensitive.

530
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,220
 When he's crying, something's wrong.

531
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,340
 And so for the past few weeks, he's been doing this.

532
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,220
 I'm like, "Buddy, what's wrong?"

533
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,420
 He's like, "Daddy, my legs hurt.

534
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,380
 "My legs hurt."

535
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,780
 And so we take him to the doctor.

536
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,240
 And we're like, "Hey, he says his legs hurt.

537
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,700
 "Like, what is it?"

538
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,580
 As a parent, you don't wanna see your kids

539
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,100
 in pain like that.

540
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,280
 And my son is probably gonna be tall.

541
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,980
 And the doctor just says, "Hey, this is growing pain."

542
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,660
 As his body is producing cells

543
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,060
 and the bones are growing

544
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,940
 and the muscles stretching,

545
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,640
 as his body is growing, those growth plates are shifting,

546
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,260
 and he's experiencing some pain.

547
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,980
 And I was reminded of a boss that I had

548
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,060
 when I was in the corporate world.

549
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,900
 He would tell me this.

550
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,320
 He'd say, "JP, you only grow when you're uncomfortable.

551
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,640
 "The only time you grow is when you're uncomfortable.

552
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,560
 "And you think that's true physically,

553
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,640
 "that's true spiritually, that's true personally.

554
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,900
 "You only grow when you're uncomfortable.

555
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,240
 "If you wanna grow, you have to press in to discomfort.

556
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,020
 "You have to carry your cross.

557
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,140
 "If you never deny yourself,

558
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,380
 "you are denying yourself growth.

559
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,180
 "If you never deny yourself in the pursuit of comfort,

560
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,420
 "you are actually denying yourself growth.

561
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,100
 "You will not grow personally."

562
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,960
 Just think about it.

563
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,820
 I mean, if anybody's New Year's resolution

564
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,560
 is to get in the gym more, mine was, right?

565
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,820
 You get in there and you have to press

566
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,140
 through the discomfort of lifting weights,

567
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,480
 the discomfort of the class,

568
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,700
 the discomfort of what you're going through,

569
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,340
 and as a result, you will grow.

570
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,280
 You will not grow spiritually.

571
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,340
 Like, some of us have the illusion

572
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,440
 that one day something's gonna happen,

573
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,500
 we're gonna wake up, we're just, we're gonna like,

574
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,820
 it's like God is gonna send His Holy Spirit

575
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,340
 to pull back the covers and to lift us out of the bed

576
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,980
 and move us to the table

577
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,020
 and set a cup of coffee in front of us,

578
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,300
 and it's just gonna be like coffee with Jesus.

579
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,180
 It's gonna be so rich, you know,

580
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,340
 and we're just sitting there, you and Jesus,

581
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,500
 and y'all are just catching up, having a great time,

582
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,740
 and He's teaching you, you know,

583
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,340
 this word here in the Greek, it means,

584
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,900
 and you're walking around, you know,

585
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,180
 like walking away from the Bible,

586
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,620
 and you just learned it, taught by the Holy Spirit,

587
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,500
 and you look back at that, and you're like,

588
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,020
 man, that was so rich, I can't wait to do it tomorrow.

589
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,340
 Some of you have that illusion,

590
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,860
 and maybe that happens,

591
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,220
 or maybe you enjoyed your quiet time this morning,

592
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,380
 but can I tell you something?

593
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,880
 Sometimes it's a grind.

594
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,900
 It's called a spiritual discipline,

595
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,780
 that you wake up tomorrow even when you don't feel like it,

596
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,280
 and you study the Scripture

597
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,180
 even when you don't feel like it,

598
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,100
 and you pray regardless of if you feel like it or not.

599
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,300
 Like, that's what I'm trying to tell you,

600
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,860
 and I hope you find relief in this.

601
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,540
 You don't have to like it for it to be right.

602
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,540
 You might just do it out of discipline.

603
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,980
 Some days you might enjoy it.

604
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,760
 Some days it might be grind,

605
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,420
 and that doesn't mean it's wrong.

606
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,380
 You will not grow professionally.

607
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,780
 Like, you might not like your job.

608
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,540
 You know what a great opportunity is for growth?

609
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,360
 A job you hate.

610
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,420
 You might not enjoy your job.

611
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,220
 Do you know that's why they pay you?

612
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,900
 See, if you enjoyed it,

613
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,180
 you might be tempted to do it for free,

614
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,800
 and they might be like, "Hey, we're gonna keep our money,

615
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,880
 "and you just keep showing up

616
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,420
 "and doing that thing you enjoy,"

617
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,000
 and it's called a hobby,

618
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,620
 but they pay you to be there

619
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,380
 because they know you don't like it.

620
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,780
 That's the exchange.

621
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,660
 That's what's going on there, right?

622
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,100
 And it doesn't matter if you don't like it.

623
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,200
 Be awesome at it.

624
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,960
 There's an application for you.

625
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,380
 Whatever you do,

626
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,820
 work at it as though you're working for the Lord.

627
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,900
 Titus 2:10 says that you make the teachings

628
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,280
 of Jesus our Savior attractive.

629
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,660
 So you be awesome at it.

630
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,280
 You work to get great at it.

631
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,260
 I've had a lot of jobs, man, a lot of jobs.

632
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,700
 I worked at Courtesy Car Wash, wiping down cars.

633
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,420
 I was a lifeguard.

634
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,260
 I worked at Gadzooks in the mall.

635
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,660
 It was in my raving days.

636
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,860
 We don't wanna go back there.

637
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,580
 And then I worked at Champ Sports,

638
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,900
 slinging them Js, sold tennis shoes

639
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,100
 for like five years, Champ Sports.

640
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,860
 Got into college, waited tables, did that thing,

641
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,820
 and then I was a graphic designer

642
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,700
 out of college for a short time.

643
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,980
 I was in business development in corporate America.

644
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,940
 That's a fancy term for sales.

645
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,820
 Had a lot of jobs.

646
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,780
 I had one particular job that I hated.

647
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,220
 This is the job I hated the most.

648
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,340
 It was working for my dad.

649
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,880
 He owned a surveying business.

650
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,780
 You guys know what surveying is?

651
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,940
 It's like where you measure land, essentially.

652
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,620
 So don't think like surveying in Dallas.

653
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,180
 We lived in the country,

654
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
 and so surveying was like measuring

655
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,540
 hundreds or thousands of acres.

656
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,020
 And so if I showed you this, that yellow line there,

657
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,540
 we'd have to draw that line

658
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,300
 by putting those two points together.

659
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,220
 But here was the problem.

660
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
 If you go to the next picture,

661
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,820
 here's what the landscape looked like.

662
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,740
 The other one.

663
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,340
 The brush, it was just like thick brush, right?

664
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,860
 And so they put little JP 100 yards away,

665
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,980
 and then they would hold this sign that you couldn't see,

666
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,020
 and then they would give me a machete,

667
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,820
 and they'd say, "Hey, you'd have to cut that brush

668
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,460
 "for 100 yards so that it would look like this,"

669
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,420
 the next picture.

670
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,540
 And you'd have to cut a line.

671
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,540
 My job for a summer was literally chopping down brush

672
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,420
 every single day of my life,

673
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,260
 and I hated it with all of my heart.

674
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,100
 I hated it.

675
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,260
 But I look back on that with fond memories,

676
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,940
 because it taught me to do something I didn't love.

677
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,920
 It produced in my life work ethic,

678
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,980
 that when I didn't feel like going to work,

679
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,360
 and I still had to,

680
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,340
 it taught me that I won't always just wanna wake up

681
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,380
 the next day and do whatever the task is before me.

682
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,840
 I never wanted to do that,

683
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,020
 but I had to,

684
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,460
 'cause it was my responsibility,

685
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,500
 'cause it was my job.

686
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:05,460
 And so I know you were asked a lot when you were younger,

687
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,020
 "What do you wanna be when you grow up?"

688
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,340
 The problem happens when you grow up

689
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,980
 and you're not what you wanna be,

690
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,740
 or you realize you don't really wanna be

691
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,940
 what you thought you wanted to be when you grow up.

692
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,820
 The key word there is want.

693
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,420
 What happens when the want's not there?

694
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,740
 What happens when the desire's not there?

695
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,500
 See, what happened in Genesis 3,

696
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,660
 if you're new to church or the Bible,

697
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,380
 Genesis 3 is God created the world,

698
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,620
 and he created man, and he put man in the world,

699
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,120
 and it was a perfect world, and all was right.

700
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,940
 In Genesis 3, man chose a way

701
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,900
 that was different than what God had for him.

702
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,240
 Sin entered the world,

703
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,780
 and then it talks about the result of that sin,

704
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,740
 and one of the specified results is,

705
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,660
 now you will work and it will be hard.

706
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,240
 Now you're gonna work the ground,

707
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,460
 and it's gonna fight against you.

708
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,020
 A result of sin, here's the truth about work.

709
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,380
 Work is supposed to be hard.

710
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,700
 Today, in the fallen world that we live in,

711
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,580
 work is hard.

712
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,500
 That's the truth.

713
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,780
 You know what's interesting about Genesis and work?

714
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,220
 Work shows up in Genesis 1 when God created man,

715
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,860
 and he says, hey, I want you to work the ground

716
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,620
 and subdue it.

717
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,540
 That's hard work.

718
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,980
 That's shovel in hand, digging holes,

719
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,620
 digging ditches kind of work.

720
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,620
 It's difficult work, but the reality of that being

721
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,180
 in Genesis 1 is it's before Genesis 3.

722
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,380
 When God created a perfect world, there was work.

723
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,260
 Work is not the result of the fall.

724
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,460
 In fact, you and I will work in heaven.

725
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
 That's the truth.

726
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,180
 We will have jobs in heaven.

727
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,940
 And so work is good.

728
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,280
 Work is hard because of sin.

729
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,220
 Not because you have the wrong job.

730
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,580
 Not because you're doing the wrong thing.

731
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,980
 It's hard because of sin.

732
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,380
 So what's the cure?

733
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,340
 Let's talk about the cure for laziness.

734
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,940
 As you consider Jesus' example,

735
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,980
 think about when he was in the garden.

736
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,020
 As Jesus was a human, he had to do things

737
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,980
 he didn't wanna do.

738
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,020
 One of the things that he didn't wanna do

739
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,660
 or didn't feel like doing was going to a cross

740
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,800
 to be publicly humiliated and tortured to death.

741
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,760
 The reason he did that was because he loved you and me.

742
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,900
 But in the garden, when he's talking to the Father,

743
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,460
 he says, Lord, Father, would you let this cup pass from me?

744
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,400
 This thing that you're asking me to do,

745
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,420
 it's so big and it's so hard.

746
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,620
 I don't know that I want to, but not my will.

747
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,100
 Your will be done.

748
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,980
 And we can learn from Christ's example

749
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,540
 that as we go to work tomorrow,

750
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,320
 he said, God, this is really hard,

751
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,900
 but what is your will in it?

752
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,620
 What would you like to produce in and through my life

753
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,740
 through this?

754
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,880
 And by Jesus' example, what we learn is simply this.

755
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,060
 Just because something is hard doesn't mean it's wrong.

756
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,680
 You've gotta leave here with that truth,

757
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,220
 that just because something is hard doesn't mean it's wrong.

758
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,500
 And when something is difficult but necessary,

759
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,820
 it requires discipline.

760
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,220
 And that's really the application of this message.

761
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,820
 The cure for laziness is discipline despite difficulty.

762
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
 You can write that down.

763
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,940
 The cure for laziness is discipline despite difficulty.

764
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,300
 Proverbs 6 says this.

765
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,820
 Go to the ant, you sluggard, lazy person.

766
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,020
 Look at the ant.

767
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,780
 Consider its ways and be wise.

768
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,340
 It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,

769
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,620
 yet it stores its provision in summer

770
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,460
 and gathers its food at harvest.

771
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,460
 It doesn't know,

772
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,540
 it doesn't know or care or think about,

773
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,620
 hey, is this hard?

774
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,380
 It says, hey, this has to be done, so I'll do it.

775
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,220
 Because I need to do it to live.

776
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,680
 And so it does it.

777
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,860
 And so it requires discipline.

778
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,300
 Professional laziness requires professional discipline.

779
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,380
 It's learning a skill, developing it, growing in it.

780
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,500
 Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book called Outliers,

781
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,020
 and he came up with this idea that

782
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,940
 to master something, to be great at anything,

783
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,420
 requires 10,000 hours.

784
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,940
 Macklemore later wrote a song about this called 10,000 Hours.

785
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,860
 He actually references Malcolm Gladwell in the song.

786
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,580
 He's saying, hey, to do anything great

787
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,860
 requires 10,000 hours of grind.

788
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,300
 Not 10,000 hours of pleasure, 10,000 hours of enjoyment,

789
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,780
 but 10,000 hours of discipline

790
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,500
 that you're going to continue to press into the grind,

791
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,580
 that you're going to honor God in the grind.

792
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,740
 And so the cure for spiritual laziness

793
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,060
 is spiritual discipline.

794
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,860
 That's why they're called spiritual disciplines,

795
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,380
 reading the word or praying or getting in community,

796
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,620
 going to church, fasting.

797
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,180
 These are spiritual disciplines.

798
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,660
 They mark your life, whether you feel like it or not.

799
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,380
 So did you wake up this morning,

800
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,020
 listen, did you wake up this morning

801
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,080
 and spend the first part of your day in God's Word?

802
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,600
 And if you didn't, if you didn't,

803
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,160
 then I just would challenge you tomorrow to do so.

804
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,840
 If you're like, man, that's hard, how do I do it?

805
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,960
 Let me tell you how to do it.

806
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,600
 Let me break it down for you, okay?

807
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,180
 Listen, how long do you want to spend in God's Word?

808
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,320
 Let's just say 30 minutes.

809
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,220
 Okay, spend a half an hour reading a scripture and praying,

810
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,840
 asking God to protect you in the day,

811
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,040
 that you would be faithful in the day,

812
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,360
 you would do his will in that day.

813
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,240
 You say, well, how are we going to do that?

814
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,400
 So here, whatever time you woke up this morning,

815
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,520
 just back up your alarm 30 minutes.

816
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,220
 Okay, back it up 30 minutes.

817
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,560
 You cool?

818
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,380
 Some of you are like shaking your hand,

819
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,220
 like no, I can't do that.

820
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,040
 Yes, you can.

821
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,440
 I promise you can do that.

822
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,560
 Back it up 30 minutes.

823
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,960
 Here's what I want you to do.

824
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,520
 You're like, yeah, but I'm just going to hit snooze.

825
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,360
 No, you're not.

826
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,240
 We're going to move the alarm across the room.

827
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,080
 Okay, move it, yeah.

828
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,800
 Oh, some gas, you know.

829
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,760
 You're going to be okay.

830
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,000
 I'm walking you through this.

831
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,120
 Write it down, it's going to be okay.

832
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,120
 Call me, actually call David, and we'll help you, okay?

833
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,760
 So back it up, back up the alarm 30 minutes.

834
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,840
 Now, here's the tricky part.

835
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,280
 Put the alarm across the room.

836
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,120
 If it's your phone, if it's an alarm clock, whatever,

837
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,480
 put it on the other side of the room.

838
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,720
 You got to get up to turn it off.

839
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,160
 Okay, your roommates are going to hate you.

840
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,440
 And then here's what I want you to do.

841
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,040
 I want you to put your Bible on top of your alarm, okay?

842
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,320
 So that before you turn it off,

843
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,200
 you got to pick up your Bible.

844
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,840
 You're already holding it in your hand, okay?

845
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,120
 That's half the battle right there, right?

846
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,080
 So you get up, you curse me.

847
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,480
 You walk across the room, okay?

848
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,100
 You pick up your Bible, you turn off your alarm,

849
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,080
 and then just keep walking to the kitchen, okay?

850
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,280
 And sit down, make yourself a cup of coffee,

851
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,080
 and just spend 30 minutes.

852
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,920
 You're like, I don't know what to do.

853
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,400
 Go to jointhejourney.com, we'll help you.

854
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
 You can read the same thing I will tomorrow.

855
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,480
 You can think, man, this is the same thing.

856
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,120
 JP's reading, DeMar's reading, Todd Wagner's reading.

857
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,520
 We're all reading the same thing.

858
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,640
 Be a short little scripture.

859
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,600
 You can read it, you can read a Devo,

860
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,480
 you can pray about it.

861
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,520
 I want you to do it tomorrow.

862
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,360
 You know what?

863
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,280
 I'll do it in the next 30 days.

864
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,400
 Let me tell you what's gonna happen in the next 30 days.

865
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,320
 30 days, yeah, 30 days, you're gonna be okay.

866
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
 30 days, here's what I want you to do.

867
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,880
 Here's what's gonna happen.

868
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,280
 You're gonna wake up and you're gonna think,

869
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,880
 you know what, I'll do that at lunch.

870
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
 No, you won't.

871
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,080
 Do it in the morning, tomorrow morning.

872
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,400
 You think, you know, I'll do it before I go to bed.

873
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,720
 Stop it.

874
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,520
 Stop making excuses.

875
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,160
 There's a lion in the road, there's a lion.

876
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,800
 No, stop, there's no lion.

877
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,600
 It's Dallas, okay?

878
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,520
 It's Texas, there's no lion.

879
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,800
 Pick up your Bible, walk to the kitchen,

880
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
 and get in that 30 minutes.

881
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,280
 And do it for 30 days, it'll be a habit after that.

882
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
 It will become easier and easier, I think so.

883
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,960
 You tell me if I'm wrong, come back and say,

884
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,320
 I did it, it wasn't easier.

885
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,040
 But let's just do that, just commit to doing that.

886
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,240
 Discipline yourself.

887
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,220
 The cure for personal laziness is to grow in discipline.

888
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,520
 You know, working out, eating right.

889
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,640
 Listen, this is something I struggle with.

890
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,560
 You've heard me say a bunch of times,

891
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,240
 we've been here long, I hate working out.

892
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,120
 'Cause it's hard, it's not fun.

893
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,920
 Nothing fun about it.

894
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,120
 Not for me, anyways.

895
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,800
 And you know what, when it comes to food,

896
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,880
 I like to eat whatever I want to eat.

897
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,560
 So I had my own resolutions.

898
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,200
 I started 2018 with a juice cleanse.

899
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,160
 Pray for me.

900
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,240
 Not eating anything solid, just drinking juice.

901
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,480
 My son, my five-year-old's like,

902
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,480
 Daddy, why would you do that?

903
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,280
 I'm like, that's a good question, I don't know.

904
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,840
 [congregation laughing]

905
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
 But here's why.

906
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,660
 Because I don't want to be a slave to my cravings.

907
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,200
 I don't want to be a slave to my body.

908
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,060
 I want my body to be a slave to me.

909
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,120
 I don't want to do what it feels.

910
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,560
 I want it to do as I feel, as I believe.

911
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,620
 Surrender to the Spirit, right?

912
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,640
 And so I'm not just following those cravings.

913
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,460
 Think about, hey, how do I kill comfort in my life

914
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,800
 so that I would replace the desire for comfort

915
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,480
 with the desire for discipline,

916
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,960
 that I would honor God in the grind?

917
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,320
 Because the cause of laziness is a craving for comfort.

918
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,160
 The cost of laziness is a wasted life.

919
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,820
 And the cure for laziness is discipline.

920
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,040
 First Timothy four, verse seven says

921
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,960
 that we're to discipline ourself

922
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,080
 for the purpose of godliness.

923
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,100
 And so if you're here and you're like,

924
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,560
 I want to be godly, what that scripture is saying

925
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,800
 is that you literally, that you can become godly

926
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,680
 through discipline.

927
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,800
 It says it right there in the scripture

928
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,920
 that godliness comes by way of discipline.

929
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,200
 Not easy, not just because you feel like it,

930
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,720
 that sometimes you have to honor God in the grind.

931
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,520
 And you want to know the truth about me

932
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,040
 when it comes to drums?

933
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,160
 I ain't great.

934
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,760
 I'm not a great drummer, percussionist, if you will.

935
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,240
 Like I could come up here and do my very best

936
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,200
 and try to fake it.

937
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,820
 I'd love to invite my friend Justin up here.

938
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:55,040
 (drumming)

939
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,200
 (cymbal crashing)

940
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,240
 That just happened.

941
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,560
 That's as good as I got.

942
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,380
 Why?

943
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,840
 I never practiced, I never disciplined myself.

944
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,360
 Justin, you've been playing the drum for what, 23 years?

945
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,640
 I just stepped on your tambourine, bro, I'm sorry.

946
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,000
 (audience laughing)

947
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
 23, Justin and I have been at the porch

948
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,120
 since the very beginning.

949
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,240
 He's been a part of the porch band.

950
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,160
 And the dude could play the drum.

951
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,320
 Can you play the drums?

952
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,360
 Play the drums for him.

953
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,620
 (drumming)

954
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,480
 (cymbal crashing)

955
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,400
 Yeah, that's like,

956
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,600
 (audience cheering)

957
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,440
 it's like,

958
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,800
 just like I did.

959
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,240
 'Cause I can hit those things with sticks.

960
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,740
 But I can't make it beautiful.

961
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,480
 I can't make it in beat.

962
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,000
 To do that takes control, it takes discipline.

963
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,760
 If you know anybody that's going to do something great

964
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,720
 with their life,

965
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,760
 they're either part of the less than 1%,

966
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,560
 or they discipline themselves.

967
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,820
 And when it got hard, they pressed in.

968
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,800
 And they said, "Lord, I don't want to do this,

969
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
 "but not my will, thy will.

970
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,780
 "What would you have me do?

971
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,120
 "How would you use my life?"

972
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,280
 Let me pray that you would.

973
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,480
 God, thank you for our friends that are here.

974
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,120
 And just the truth in the scriptures

975
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,360
 is these practical life lessons

976
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,520
 that can feel a little bit like tips and tricks

977
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,640
 to living life.

978
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,200
 But the truth is you've called us

979
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,320
 to discipline ourself for godliness.

980
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,080
 And God, some of us, and I'll start with me,

981
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,280
 I need to confess the sin of laziness.

982
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,760
 I don't like it when my wife leaves a list for me to do.

983
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,500
 I've got a bunch of tasks, and I love to sleep in, God.

984
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,680
 I really, I love to do what I want to do.

985
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,180
 I love to feed my flesh.

986
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,100
 And God, I acknowledge that's not gonna produce greatness,

987
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,660
 an act of worship for you.

988
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,780
 And so, Lord, I want to present,

989
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,020
 we want to present our bodies as living sacrifices.

990
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
 Would you see them as holy and pleasing?

991
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,140
 That this would be our spiritual act of worship.

992
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,060
 Father, help us not to conform any longer

993
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,740
 to the patterns of this world.

994
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,180
 We got to help us to be transformed

995
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,780
 by the renewing of our mind,

996
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,300
 that we might be able to test and approve what your will is,

997
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,300
 your good, pleasing, and perfect will.

998
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

999
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
