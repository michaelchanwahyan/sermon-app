00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,040
 Love it. Fort Worth, Houston, anywhere you are around the world, tuning in.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,300
 We're so glad you're with us as we move through this series, Romans 8.

6
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,640
 This is a book.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,920
 It's called Princess -- this is a book, guys.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,880
 It's called Princess with a Purpose.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,400
 And it's a book I read to my little girls.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,560
 The other day, Finley got to choose a book to take to school

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
 that the teacher would read to the class.

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,420
 And she chose this one.

13
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,240
 I'm glad she did.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,860
 I have a love/hate relationship with this book because I love it.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,960
 I love the message in it.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,880
 Every time I read it, it messes me up.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,020
 I can't make it through without breaking down.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,760
 So I know Big Man with the little pink book.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,680
 But I thought I would start -- I thought I'd start just reading to you.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,700
 So essentially, let me just give you kind of the layout of the characters.

21
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,800
 We're going to start really theologically deep here.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,000
 There is Caroline, Princess Caroline, if you will.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,060
 And then there's Prissy Chrissy.

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,220
 She's the antagonist.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,660
 And then there's the kind of princess trainer, if you will, named Lily.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,740
 And so those are the characters.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,280
 Caroline, Prissy Chrissy, Lily, the princess trainer.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,180
 And so essentially, Caroline was born -- or we don't know, you know, how this happened.

29
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,700
 But she doesn't have a mom and a dad.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,240
 She lives with her grandmother.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
 And she's going to go to princess prep school.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,660
 And at princess prep school, she continues to bump against this idea that in order

33
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,440
 to be a princess, you have to have a king as a father.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,040
 And because she doesn't, you know, it's pretty heartbreaking.

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,840
 And so then the drama ensues.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,260
 But -- and so Prissy -- so it goes -- I'll just read some to you.

37
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,240
 "What are you doing here?"

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,220
 asked Prissy Chrissy.

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,360
 "Don't you know that you need a king as your father and a queen

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,080
 as your mother to be a real princess?"

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,720
 And then I'm going to skip ahead.

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,780
 And so this is Lily talking to Prissy Chrissy.

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,980
 "You are beautiful, Princess," Lily replied.

45
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,540
 "But the way you look and the dresses you wear don't make you a real princess.

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,740
 Look at the pretty pink flowers on the table.

47
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,080
 In a few days, they won't be beautiful anymore.

48
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,680
 Outside beauty fades away, but real beauty comes from inside your heart.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,060
 A real princess has a heart full of love for her king and others.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,160
 That's what makes her truly beautiful."

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,700
 "I don't believe it," shouted Prissy Chrissy.

52
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,060
 "Loving others can't be more important than the pretty dresses I wear."

53
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,080
 "It's true," said Princess Lily.

54
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,900
 "A real princess has a heart filled with love.

55
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,420
 Doesn't a real princess have to be a king's daughter?"

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,660
 asked Caroline, hoping she was wrong.

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,820
 "Yes," cried Princess Lily.

58
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,420
 "But not just a king.

59
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,460
 He has to be" -- this word gets weird.

60
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,300
 "He has to be the king of kings."

61
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,380
 "Prissy Chrissy was right," cried Caroline.

62
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,420
 "I don't have a father, so I can't become a real princess."

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,100
 "Caroline, is that why you've been sad?"

64
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,620
 Princess Lily asked.

65
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,900
 "You've been thinking about your earthly father instead of your heavenly father."

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,660
 "My heavenly father?" Caroline asked.

67
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,900
 "Remember when you first believed that Jesus died on the cross for all the bad

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,500
 things you've done?" Caroline nodded.

69
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,180
 "You became a real princess the moment you believed Jesus died on the cross for

70
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,660
 your sins and was raised to life again.

71
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,220
 And since he is the king of kings and you are his daughter, that makes you his."

72
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,220
 "Princess, I'm a real princess?" Caroline cried.

73
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,060
 She'd been a real princess all along with Jesus in her heart.

74
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,500
 She was the daughter of the king of kings.

75
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,940
 "I don't know how to be a real princess," Caroline said.

76
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,100
 "I want to know everything about who I am to Jesus and be the princess he wants me

77
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,500
 to be."

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,740

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,460
 I know it's a silly book.

00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,500
 Amazing truth in that silly book.

81
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,900
 The reason I love it for my little girls, I love them to read it because there's a

82
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,580
 story in that book that is all of our stories.

83
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,660
 It's your story.

84
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,740
 It's the story of the scripture, Genesis to Revelation.

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,380
 It's the story of God pursuing a people, not just any people, but his children,

86
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,420
 gathering them throughout the scriptures that I want desperately that Presley and

87
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,820
 Finley, my two little girls would know that they're not just my daughters.

88
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,940
 That means nothing.

89
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,940
 They are daughters to the most high God, the king of kings, Jesus Christ, that they

90
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,980
 can have his spirit and move through this world, navigating all things with his

91
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,580
 power.

92
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,820
 And this is what I want you to know this evening.

93
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,740
 This may be the most profound, most important truth in the entire scriptures.

94
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,260
 And so tonight we're talking about the reality that we are children of God.

95
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,500
 This is the doctrine, the heavy theological term called the doctrine of

96
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,380
 adoption that you've been adopted.

97
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,500
 And I wrote this down because it's really important.

98
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,660
 I just said, if we misunderstand how God views us, then we will not view God

99
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,300
 correctly.

100
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,220
 If we do not view God correctly, then we cannot worship him appropriately, nor can

101
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,020
 we navigate this life correctly.

102
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,860
 Maybe the most important theological idea in the entire scriptures is who you are to

103
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,940
 God, how he views you.

104
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,700
 You must leave tonight with an understanding of how he views you.

105
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,020
 And if you do, this changes everything.

106
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,580
 It changes your quiet time, your community group, how you attend church, how you

107
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,020
 follow the rules, how you work, how you engage in relationships, how you treat

108
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,540
 others, how you live in an apartment or in a neighborhood.

109
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,700
 It changes everything.

110
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,780
 If you understand who you are to God.

111
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,820
 And so when Romans chapter eight, as we move through a series affectionately

112
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,620
 called Romans eight, walk by the spirit.

113
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,380
 And to recap, we talked about what does it look like last week to let the spirit

114
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,100
 drive the flesh wants to drive, but the spirit and the flesh are at war for the

115
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,940
 driver's seat of your life, which is your mind.

116
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,300
 Romans eight said they want the power, the real estate, the car, the vehicle of

117
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,540
 your mind, because whoever controls the mind of a man controls the whole man.

118
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,860
 And so the flesh and the spirit are at war.

119
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,540
 And, uh, and so we're in Romans eight, Paul wrote this book, Romans two, the

120
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,380
 church in Rome, a people he had never met around 57 AD.

121
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,820
 There's a lot of cultural turmoil going on in Rome at this time.

122
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,300
 Uh, persecution is beginning and it's about to ramp up.

123
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,940
 And so Paul writes to them about what it means to follow Jesus, what it means to

124
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,980
 live by the spirit, what it means to know God and, and in today, tonight to be his

125
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,500
 children.

126
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,820
 And so I'll just read, we're going to be in verses 14 through 17.

127
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,660
 For those who are led by the spirit of God or children of God, the spirit you

128
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,860
 received does not make you slaves so that you live in fear again.

129
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,620
 Rather, the spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.

130
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,260
 And by him, we cry ABBA father, the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we

131
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,300
 are God's children.

132
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,180
 Now, if we are children, then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.

133
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,940
 If indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.

134
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,020
 And so we're going to, how we're going to break this out this evening is going to be

135
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,420
 first.

136
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,940
 We're going to look at how our behavior points to whom we belong.

137
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,140
 That's verse 14.

138
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,860
 And then verses 15 and 16, how God's spirit makes us his children, not his slaves.

139
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,060
 And then verse 17, the benefit of being God's children.

140
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,460
 What does it mean for us?

141
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,660
 And so we'll start with verse 14, which says this for those who are led by the spirit of

142
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,260
 God are the children of God.

143
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,220
 And when I read that verse, I asked myself, OK, what is the verb there and what does it

144
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,580
 mean when it says led by the spirit of God?

145
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,820
 So led right there, there's the verb that we're actually following God's spirit, that

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,060
 that this is not just this idea that there's the spirit of God, that he's out there, but

147
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,140
 we're actually following him.

148
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,940
 And therefore we are his children, not will be OK, not one day, not sometime in the

149
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,340
 future, but as we are led by his spirit, we are the children of God.

150
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,140
 And so when sometimes my family and I, we go to this little park in the neighborhood

151
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,780
 and it's called Twin Lakes and there's always ducks there and there's a big duck and

152
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
 it followed by a bunch of ducklings really cute, right?

153
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,900
 Crossing the street or swimming in the pond.

154
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,060
 There's always a big duck and a bunch of ducklings behind them.

155
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,980
 And I never look at that group of ducks and wonder, you know, who do they belong to?

156
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,340
 Whose whose kids are those?

157
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,580
 I know they belong to the one that they follow.

158
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,700
 And in the same way, some of us are here tonight and we're like, we're Christ followers,

159
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
 but we're not following Christ.

160
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,780
 You're not following Christ, you're not a Christ follower.

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,820
 Like it's not it's not that really profound reality.

162
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,620
 You can't just say I'm a Christ follower.

163
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,100
 And I follow him.

164
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,020
 Being led by his spirit.

165
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,420
 Knowing his will, walking in his will.

166
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,580
 And so my first point this evening is our behavior points to whom we belong.

167
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,420
 Our behavior points to whom we belong.

168
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,180
 This this word lead it's it's in the scripture over and over and it's said different

169
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,180
 ways, it's said governed by controlled by in indwelled by submissive to his spirit.

170
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,300
 But here in this verse, it says lead.

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,420
 I will tell you that one of the strange forces of nature is that kids become like their parents.

172
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,020
 It's a force of nature that you exist in.

173
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,660
 Even those of you that I will never be like him.

174
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,420
 Yeah, yeah, you will probably.

175
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,220
 I mean, at least in some ways.

176
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,340
 At least in some ways, it's a really powerful force.

177
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,300
 You can think of you see this in Hollywood.

178
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,020
 You think about a boy that was raised by wolves, you know, he's howling at the moon.

179
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,220
 Why? He was raised by wolves.

180
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,180
 Raised by wolves or you think a Tarzan swinging from trees, you know, he's raised by monkeys

181
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,100
 or raised by gorillas or whatever, raised by apes.

182
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,540
 Right. So therefore he is like them in the same way.

183
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,100
 I see this in my own home.

184
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,060
 OK, my wife speaks with this really cute kind of Southern draw.

185
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,300
 And she's she when she's excited, she draws out the last word that she says.

186
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
 She'll go, oh, hi.

187
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
 How are you today?

188
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,980
 That's just kind of how she talks.

189
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,660
 Right. And I noticed this in my son Weston, my three and a half year old.

190
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,620
 He's like, Daddy, can we drive in your truck?

191
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,660
 Daddy, I want to go to the store.

192
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,140
 And I was like, why does he do that?

193
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,500
 And then my brother in law told me, you know why he does that, right?

194
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,020
 He got that from Monica because she does that.

195
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,700
 And I was like, that's right.

196
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
 She does do that.

197
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,500
 And it's not just that, like she's Monica's really clean, like she's very organized, very

198
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,580
 neat. She straightens everything.

199
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,940
 And I noticed that that my little girl Finley, before she'd go to bed, she'd have to

200
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,180
 straighten out all the little my little ponies on her dresser.

201
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,020
 They'd all have to be facing the same way.

202
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,780
 Everything squared. I know your OCD radar is going off right now.

203
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,620
 And so and every and I'm like, where does she go?

204
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,660
 I know where she gets that from Monica.

205
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,260
 And I won't just pick on her because then I see my other daughter, Presley.

206
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,820
 Right. She just has this crazy desire for adventure, like sometimes to her detriment,

207
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,340
 like she can make foolish decisions, pursuing adventure and just kind of not

208
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,940
 understanding limits and boundaries.

209
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,220
 And she gets that for me.

210
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,660
 And and I see it like it, our children are like us, they carry our DNA and God's

211
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,020
 children are like him, they carry his spirit.

212
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,900
 They are led by his spirit.

213
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,340
 They look like him.

214
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,660
 And so one of the clearest marks that we belong to God is that we obey his spirit.

215
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,660
 And so many Christians have attempted to fake this.

216
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,940
 Like so many Christians have attempted to follow the rules so that it may appear when I

217
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,260
 say Christians, I mean in quotes like like supposed Christians, that it may appear that

218
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,420
 they are following God's spirit.

219
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,460
 But in reality, they're following the rules and they're wearing themselves out.

220
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,380
 Right. It's not following God's spirit.

221
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,540
 This is a following, a watching, a knowing, a walking in relationship with.

222
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,420
 It cannot be faked for long.

223
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,380
 If you fake it for a little bit, you will eventually wear yourself out completely.

224
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,740
 It's the difference between like if I want you to get somewhere and I can hand you some

225
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,140
 directions and I can say, hey, just follow these directions.

226
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,780
 That's that's impersonal.

227
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,500
 Right. You don't need a relationship with me to follow these directions.

228
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,540
 And you sit there, if you don't know where you're going, you're going to be like, OK,

229
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,100
 turn here. OK, five miles.

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,340
 OK, look for a yellow sign.

231
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,540
 OK, look for a, you know, a water tower.

232
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,100
 Take a right. Go three miles.

233
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,580
 Like you're going to really you're not going to want to get lost.

234
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,700
 But it's so much easier if I said, oh, follow me.

235
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,820
 Oh, you want to go there, follow me, just watch me turn where I turn, go where I go,

236
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,860
 drive where I drive.

237
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,580
 This is what God's spirit says.

238
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,980
 He was here, he lived, he breathed in Christ.

239
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,900
 And he says, follow me, it's a it's a personal relationship.

240
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,660
 Don't follow the rules.

241
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:56,180
 Follow me. Follow me, follow my life, my example, Christ says, God says through his

242
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,860
 spirit, because if you continue to try to pursue God simply by following the rule,

243
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,860
 following the rules, you will get lost.

244
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,940
 You will get lost.

245
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,020
 And so this is why we don't manage behaviors here at the porch, we teach belief.

246
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,180
 Right. I mean, like just because someone's here, like there are people here who carry

247
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,380
 Bibles, who've memorized scriptures, and they are not God's children.

248
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,460
 They are not God's children, at least not yet.

249
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,420
 They have not been adopted to him by the blood of Jesus Christ.

250
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,580
 They are God's creation not to be confused with God's children.

251
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,820
 And they may come up to you and they may run game and they may fake it and they may even

252
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,420
 follow the rules for a little while.

253
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,220
 And I know people who marry those folks only to find out they are not God's children.

254
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
 And so watch carefully who someone follows.

255
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,420
 Is it just the rules or is it God's spirit so that they might be his children?

256
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,900
 This happens, by the way, upon trusting in Jesus, when you believe in Jesus Christ, his

257
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,540
 death and resurrection as a final payment once and for all for the for your sins, for

258
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,500
 the wrong you've done.

259
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,580
 You believe that he raised from the grave in that moment you are given God's spirit.

260
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,260
 OK, not later, not a second baptism, not a second filling, not the doctrine of

261
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,540
 subsequent blessing is a theological term.

262
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,100
 If that means anything to you, it happens all at one time.

263
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,300
 Sometimes people say, well, yeah, well, that's weird because because, you know, I

264
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,700
 trusted Christ when I was six years old and I was in the church and this and that.

265
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,100
 But then I was rebellious this whole time.

266
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,860
 And then when I was 21, I began to follow God's spirit.

267
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,980
 And I just would say, hey, maybe when you were 21, you actually trusted Christ.

268
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,820
 Right. And don't be afraid of that story, that narrative.

269
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,980
 I think some people are like, well, I can't say that because that would mean I wasn't a

270
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,100
 Christian when I lived at my parents' house or that would.

271
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,380
 I don't know. Listen, I'm not bothered if you say you are a Christian when you were

272
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,580
 six or 21.

273
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,300
 I don't know when you received God's spirit, but I know that it was the moment that you

274
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,500
 trusted in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection for the payment of your sins.

275
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,260
 That that happened at one time.

276
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:17,180
 And so the benefit of of this reality is that we access God as his child.

277
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:22,420
 Guys. Can you imagine this?

278
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,580
 You have access to the creator of the heavens, the earth as his child, because I love

279
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,380
 being here with you. Like there is nowhere I would rather be.

280
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,260
 You are a priority priority to me.

281
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,220
 I love being here. I love this place.

282
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,180
 I love teaching. I love what God is doing.

283
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,540
 I love having a front row seat of watching him work in your lives, watching him change

284
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,100
 this city and Fort Worth and Houston and other places through the lives of young adults.

285
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,540
 And there is very few things in the world that could pull me off this stage.

286
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,340
 But make no mistake about it.

287
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,980
 Emily comes up and says, hey, your kids need you.

288
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,780
 I'm in my truck down the road before you can say what happened.

289
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,700
 OK, that's my first ministry.

290
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,820
 If my wife called right now or came in and said, hey, we need you, the kids need you,

291
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,940
 Presley need you, hey, something happened.

292
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,780
 I'm gone before you even realize it.

293
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,300
 Because they're my priority.

294
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,020
 You have God's attention in that way.

295
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:29,820
 Like I'm a really imperfect dad, I love him perfectly, he loves you perfectly.

296
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,060
 And you have access to him.

297
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,580
 I've heard it said before, it's like God's the the president of the universe.

298
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,660
 Like you can't just I can't even access the president of the United States.

299
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,780
 Like he's in important meetings.

300
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,820
 I don't have access to him.

301
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,860
 You better believe his daughters do.

302
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,180
 You better believe that his daughters can kick in that door and say, daddy, I need you.

303
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,940
 And he's attentive.

304
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,340
 At least if he's a good father, that's true.

305
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,700
 You have access to God, he's your daddy, you are led by his spirit, you are his

306
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,340
 child.

307
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,100
 Verse 15.

308
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:11,180
 The spirit you receive does not make you slaves so that you live in fear again.

309
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,420
 And when I read that the spirit you receive does not make you slaves so that you live

310
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,060
 in fear again.

311
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,020
 And I just like what the curious word to me there is fear.

312
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,420
 Like who is afraid?

313
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,460
 Like who's like, oh, is this spirit of God give me?

314
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,980
 Is it going to make me afraid?

315
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,300
 And I really wrestled with what does this mean?

316
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,620
 And what it's saying is, hey, it's reference to the law.

317
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,940
 You used to have to follow the law, and if you didn't follow the law, you were at risk

318
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,500
 of of betraying God.

319
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,980
 And you may not be able to get to God because out of obedience, you didn't follow the

320
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
 law and they would live in fear.

321
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,060
 And he's saying, hey, this spirit that you now have, you don't have to live in fear.

322
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,580
 You can follow God's spirit.

323
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,540
 Let me just hit this.

324
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,180
 I got done preaching last Tuesday.

325
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,380
 Girl walks up and we engage in a conversation.

326
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,580
 I say between one and ten, how certain are you that if you died tonight, you go to

327
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,740
 heaven? She said eight.

328
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,900
 I said, OK, you stand before God.

329
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,060
 He says, why should I let you in?

330
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,300
 What would you say?

331
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,220
 And she said, because Christ has died for my sins and God raised him from the dead.

332
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,900
 And I said, 80 percent of your sins.

333
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,340
 And she said, well, this is where I get confused.

334
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,300
 This is where I struggle, she said, because what if I leave here and I sin, but I don't

335
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,420
 know it? And I got to tell her this beautiful reality that Christ had died for all of

336
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,740
 her sins, past, present, future, all of them paid for on the cross.

337
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:39,060
 And if she sinned unknowingly, God's spirit would come in this beautiful thing, a job

338
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,180
 that the spirit, a what am I trying to say?

339
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,860
 A responsibility of God's spirit is that he convicts us of sin, that he shows it to us,

340
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,660
 that we grieve the spirit of God.

341
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,100
 It's evidence that you have the spirit of God is he doesn't let you continue in those

342
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,660
 ways. He doesn't let you continue sleeping together.

343
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,540
 He doesn't let you continue to get drunk.

344
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,180
 He doesn't let you to continue to look at pornography.

345
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,140
 He grieves you.

346
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,660
 He you're saddened by it.

347
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,820
 You feel it deeply inside.

348
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,900
 He doesn't let you continue in fake religiosity.

349
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,580
 He doesn't let you continue in self-righteousness.

350
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,300
 He convicts you.

351
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,180
 It's a job description of the Holy Spirit.

352
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,460
 It says it goes on to say, verse 15, rather the spirit you received brought about your

353
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:33,020
 adoption to sonship and by him that is by this spirit, we cry Abba, father, the spirit

354
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,860
 himself testifies with our spirit.

355
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,820
 That's our human spirit, our human nature.

356
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,580
 The spirit, God's spirit testifies with our personal spirit that we are God's children.

357
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,700
 And this word Abba here, this is the one that strikes me as curious here because it

358
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,980
 essentially means father.

359
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,420
 It's like, and by him we cry father, father.

360
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,100
 It's like, why would Paul use Abba?

361
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,460
 Abba is not a Greek word.

362
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,340
 He wrote this in Greek.

363
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,980
 This is an Aramaic word.

364
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,740
 It's a very personal, intimate word for daddy, for Papa.

365
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,540
 It's a very intimate word for father, and it's like Paul saying by him we cry out,

366
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,140
 there's not a word, there's not a word.

367
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,780
 Oh, there's this Aramaic word Abba.

368
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,260
 I'll use that Abba father.

369
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,780
 That it's that personal relationship.

370
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:23,300
 Not long ago, I was doing a friend's wedding in the Dominican Republic, and we have a

371
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,540
 mutual friend who's a missionary in Haiti, Haiti and the Dominican share the island

372
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,060
 together.

373
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,460
 And so she came over our missionary friend in Haiti and, and we were there, there with

374
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,660
 the friends, the Shane's were there.

375
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,220
 You remember this B we were playing volleyball and, uh, you just wake up and

376
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,100
 you're like, Oh, he's talking.

377
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,900
 I'm just kidding.

378
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,140
 And, uh, and so we were playing volleyball and, and we walk up on her.

379
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,420
 And so she's in this kind of weird, like, you know, sitting legs crossed, uh, hands

380
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,500
 on her knees, kind of like this, like deep meditation.

381
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 And so my buddy walks up to her and goes, Hey, are you okay?

382
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,020
 And she kind of looks up.

383
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,020
 She goes, Oh yeah, just talking to Papa.

384
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,860
 And I thought three things.

385
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,900
 The first I thought that's weird.

386
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:22,940
 And then I thought, man, I bet she views God very different than I do.

387
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,580
 And then I thought, I bet she's more right.

388
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,900
 Like, you'll never hear me say just talking to Papa.

389
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,260
 It's just, it's just not how I view God.

390
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,860
 I like you, God, you're God.

391
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,780
 Like not Papa.

392
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,700
 Hey daddy, come here.

393
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,580
 You know, but that's what this verse is saying.

394
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,980
 His spirit testifies with our spirit that we come in him.

395
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,220
 This really vulnerable state.

396
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,940
 Daddy, God, you're my dad.

397
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,620
 God's my dad.

398
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,380
 The creator of the heavens and the earth is my, my dad.

399
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,940
 It's really vulnerable.

400
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,580
 I mean, it just, it just kills all the pride in you.

401
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,620
 God's my daddy.

402
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,340
 My Papa, father in heaven.

403
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,460
 Second point is God's spirit makes us his sons and daughters, not his slaves.

404
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,220
 Embrace this incredible reality that God's spirit makes us his sons and daughters, not his slaves.

405
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,500
 So what is this distinction?

406
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,860
 You must understand this.

407
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:33,780
 One is like slavery is doing something out of only obedience, just because you're told being afraid.

408
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,620
 The other is doing something out of trust.

409
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,140
 I know it's best for me.

410
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,900
 I trust you.

411
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,460
 I know you have my best interest in mind.

412
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,420
 Like anyone can force someone or I'll just say like people can be forced to submit.

413
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:59,860
 But love and trust allows people to willfully follow someone, and this should mark our relationship with God, love and trust.

414
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:05,100
 This weekend, I, um, I didn't have much going on, honestly, which is, which is great.

415
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,660
 Like there were no weddings.

416
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,740
 There was no ministry up here, no formal work ministry.

417
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,100
 I wasn't teaching anywhere.

418
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:19,940
 And so when I have weekends like that, it's, it's, I go home and I just kind of view my job responsibility is to say yes.

419
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,700
 Like as much as I possibly can.

420
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,420
 Yes.

421
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,780
 And so the kids, I mean, they, they know that.

422
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,500
 And so they came strong and they just asked all the, they're like, they're like, daddy, can we go to the park?

423
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,020
 Yes.

424
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,100
 Can we eat here?

425
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,500
 Yes.

426
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,940
 Can we go ride the golf cart?

427
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,420
 Yes.

428
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,780
 Can we go ride our bikes?

429
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,300
 Yes.

430
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,580
 Yes.

431
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,940
 Can we go drive Weston's remote control car?

432
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,780
 Yes.

433
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,220
 Sure.

434
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,660
 Can we go to the school and play?

435
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,100
 Yes.

436
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,500
 Can we go camping?

437
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,380
 Uh, and so I was like, nah, I don't know.

438
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,220
 Camping.

439
00:24:47,220 --> 00:25:01,060
 I was like, it's going to be cold and no, but what if, and so what I do is I go in the living room and I clear out this space and I get the tent and all by myself, I construct this tent, which is a pretty incredible task.

440
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:09,740
 If I do say so myself and, uh, and, and they have this like flashlight that puts stars on the ceilings, ceiling rather.

441
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,820
 And so I hang it at just the right height.

442
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,500
 There's stars all over the ceiling.

443
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,300
 I build this huge kind of six person, 10.

444
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,580
 I lay out a pallet.

445
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,700
 I put their sleeping bags and I'm like, Hey, what if we camp inside the house?

446
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,420
 Like anything and everything.

447
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,220
 If they're not asking me something for crazy, I'm like, yeah, let's do it.

448
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,140
 I want to be a good, good father.

449
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,460
 I want to be a good dad to you.

450
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,260
 Let's go.

451
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,900
 And so it was a great weekend.

452
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,900
 And then Sunday night rolled around and I was setting out clothes for my little girl, Finley.

453
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,380
 She's seven to where to school.

454
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,020
 And, and so I checked the weather, you know, Hey, what's she going to.

455
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:48,300
 And so, um, I saw it was 50 degrees in the morning and 85 degrees in the afternoon.

456
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,660
 Right?

457
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,540
 No, no, this is something I can handle.

458
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,820
 You know, I'm thinking, okay, we're going to go short sleeve shirt, cute gap hoodie, the zipper layers.

459
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,180
 Like you wear layers.

460
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,660
 You can shed the external layer.

461
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,700
 You're going to be good to go.

462
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,620
 Picked out some jeggings, some shoes, like we were going to rock it, you know, and I lay it all out for her.

463
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,780
 And she grabs this like long sleeve, thick shirt with birds on it.

464
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,340
 And she's like, daddy, I want to wear this one.

465
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,180
 I was like, girl, you can't, you're going to be so hot.

466
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,140
 Cause 85 degrees.

467
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,860
 You don't even know this Texas weather's bipolar.

468
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,300
 You just, you just got to understand me.

469
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,860
 Right.

470
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,780
 And she starts throwing a fit.

471
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:26,260
 She starts throwing a flat out fit.

472
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,380
 I mean, crying, you know, why, why did I?

473
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,020
 Why can't you?

474
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,780
 Why don't you pick up my shirt?

475
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
 And I'm like, Finley, calm down.

476
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,980
 Why are you doing this?

477
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,620
 Finley, listen, you're going to be hot in that.

478
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,700
 I'm telling you this for your own good.

479
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,060
 You don't want to wear that shirt.

480
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,940
 Trust me.

481
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,020
 So like daddy, daddy, I don't want to Finley.

482
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,460
 Why don't you want to wear this cute gap shirt?

483
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
 I mean, it's going to be amazing.

484
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,540
 Hoodie zipper, take it off, you know, matches and everything.

485
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:54,940
 Come on.

486
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,420
 Like, why don't you want to wear this?

487
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:04,140
 And, uh, and she kept saying this, she kept saying, because I'm wearing it.

488
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,260
 You don't have to wear it, daddy.

489
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,060
 I'm wearing it.

490
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,740
 I want to wear what I want to wear.

491
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,140
 Here's what she's saying.

492
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,780
 She said, because I'm not your slave, daddy.

493
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,780
 I'm not your slave.

494
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,140
 I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it.

495
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,940
 I don't want to, I don't want to do something just because you're telling me to do it.

496
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,260
 I want to do what I want to do.

497
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,100
 And I'm just like, I know you're not my slave.

498
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,820
 You're my daughter, my little girl.

499
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,540
 I love you.

500
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,140
 And if you wear that shirt, you're going to catch on fire.

501
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,580
 Literally, you know, and I'm like, trust me.

502
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,300
 She has soccer practice afterwards.

503
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,020
 I'm like, you are going to burn up.

504
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,820
 Right.

505
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:48,140
 Everything I'm telling you is for your own benefit.

506
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,180
 And here's the profound reality.

507
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:59,980
 Every single thing that God asks of you is for your own benefit.

508
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,660
 It's crazy.

509
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,860
 Everything that God asks of you, he's not trying to withhold good from you.

510
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,620
 He's not trying to rip you off.

511
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,300
 I'm not trying to rip Finley off.

512
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
 All she sees is daddy won't let me do what I want to do.

513
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
 And I'm like, no, it's for your own good.

514
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,660
 It's cute.

515
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,380
 Gap shirt.

516
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,820
 Come on.

517
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,140
 You know?

518
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,340
 And she just thinks I want to rip her off.

519
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,260
 I don't want to rip you off.

520
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:28,220
 Everything God asks of you is for your own benefit is for your own good.

521
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,540
 See, this is a slave relationship.

522
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,060
 Do what I say for my benefit.

523
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,700
 Do what I say for my benefit.

524
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
 That's slave.

525
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,500
 That's slave relationship.

526
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,540
 You do what I say for my benefit.

527
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,180
 Slave.

528
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,380
 Do what I say for your benefit.

529
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,820
 That's son.

530
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:58,060
 Do what I say, but I'm saying it for your own benefit.

531
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,620
 That's son.

532
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,020
 One slave, one son.

533
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,180
 This is God.

534
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,740
 This is the relationship we have with God right here.

535
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,420
 And so why don't we trust God?

536
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,540
 Because we want freedom.

537
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,540
 We want the freedom to date how we want to date.

538
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,300
 We want the freedom to date whoever we want to date.

539
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,420
 We want the freedom to have sex with whoever we want to have sex with.

540
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,660
 We want the freedom to watch whatever show or whatever movie we want to watch.

541
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,900
 The freedom to work wherever we want to work.

542
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,180
 The freedom to smoke whatever we want to smoke.

543
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:33,100
 The freedom to drink whatever we want to drink, to wear whatever clothes we want to wear, to spend money however we want to spend money.

544
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,220
 We want the freedom to spend money however we want to spend money.

545
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,140
 Freedom to go wherever we want to go.

546
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,420
 Freedom to spend time with whoever we want to spend time with.

547
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,780
 Freedom to be friends with whomever we want to be friends with.

548
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,660
 And God says, I have something better for you.

549
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,860
 Will you trust me?

550
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,300
 Because everything he asks is for your own benefit.

551
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,140
 And seeing this and understanding this is spiritual maturity.

552
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,100
 If you do not do what I say, you will be harmed.

553
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,820
 Slavery.

554
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,580
 If you do what I say, you will be blessed.

555
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,700
 Sonship.

556
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,740
 If you work the estate out of obligation.

557
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,580
 Slavery.

558
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:30,660
 If you work the estate because it's your estate, it's your inheritance, it's the place that you're going to own forever and ever and ever.

559
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660
 Sonship.

560
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:37,860
 And so here's the profound reality that if we got this, it would be a game changer in our world and in our life.

561
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,300
 Spiritual maturity is not just knowledge of and obedience to God, but also the enjoyment of him.

562
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,380
 Let me say that again.

563
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:57,780
 Spiritual maturity is not just knowledge of and obedience to God, but also the enjoyment of him.

564
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,100
 Like we pursue God out of an enjoyment of him in the same way.

565
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,260
 That not everyone obeyed my dad.

566
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,820
 But I obeyed my dad.

567
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,180
 So I knew my dad loved me.

568
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,700
 Some of you didn't know your dad loved you.

569
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,220
 Some of you didn't have a dad.

570
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,140
 Some of your dad, some of your dads didn't love you.

571
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:24,780
 It's a reality of this broken world and it will mess your view of God up.

572
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,260
 Especially when we call him Heavenly Father, Daddy, Abba, Papa.

573
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,140
 I get it.

574
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,940
 I hate that for you.

575
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,260
 I really, really do.

576
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,860
 But you need to know you are perfectly loved.

577
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,940
 Not like your daddy loved you, but forever and ever and ever and ever.

578
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,100
 And 200 years from now, it's not going to matter how your daddy loved you because you

579
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,540
 are going to see the perfect love of a perfect father.

580
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,420
 And it's going to be redemptive.

581
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,620
 It's going to be really, really redemptive.

582
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,460
 So we go to God, the father, by his spirit, out of love and trust.

583
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,980
 We call him Daddy.

584
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,180
 Verse 17.

585
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,900
 Now, if we are children, then we are also heirs, heirs of God.

586
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,940
 We get to inherit what is God's and co-heirs with Christ.

587
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,220
 We inherit what belongs to Jesus.

588
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,180
 If indeed we share in his sufferings in

589
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,660
 order that we may also share in his glory.

590
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,700
 Now, at first reading, it sounds like, OK,

591
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:33,700
 you get to inherit what is coming to Christ if you suffer for him.

592
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,460
 But this if indeed is not translated, if indeed it is actually better translated

593
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:46,660
 since because in reality we so let me read it that way.

594
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,740
 Then we are heirs, heirs of God and co-heirs

595
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,900
 with Christ since we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share

596
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,020
 in his glory, see suffering for Christ is not optional to the believer.

597
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,460
 You live in a world that you do not belong to.

598
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,380
 And so when you point others to Christ,

599
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,380
 you will absolutely suffer for and suffer with Christ.

600
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,340
 It's it's not a conditional, it's not if you do it's since you will.

601
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,380
 You get to inherit the kingdom.

602
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,780
 And so my third and final point is the benefit of being God's children.

603
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,180
 I want to talk with you about the benefit of being God's children,

604
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,540
 the first benefit of being God's children.

605
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,300
 And this is kind of crazy, but it's that you can suffer

606
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,140
 or that you can trust him in suffering.

607
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,540
 Friends, you're going to suffer.

608
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,100
 In this world, you will have trouble,

609
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,900
 Jesus says, but take heart of overcome the world.

610
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,940
 You're going to suffer.

611
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,260
 This world is not the world we belong to.

612
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,460
 We don't belong to this world.

613
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,140
 We're strangers and aliens here.

614
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,500
 And we always think of suffering as bad.

615
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,300
 And some of you are like, how is suffering not bad?

616
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,340
 Well, just think about it. Right.

617
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,460
 You suffer in the gym, right?

618
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,540
 Get under 225, push it up 16 times.

619
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,380
 If you're David Marvin and you're right, you're sweating, you're working out.

620
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,980
 You're here.

621
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,580
 OK, I'm sorry.

622
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,420
 That wasn't honest.

623
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,380
 And so you're you're willingly suffering, right?

624
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,180
 If you train for a marathon, you're willingly suffering.

625
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,020
 Why? Because it produces perseverance.

626
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,380
 It helps you be healthy.

627
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,620
 It helps you endure.

628
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,220
 You train in such a way that you can persevere more and more and more.

629
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,260
 And likewise, suffering for Christ is a suffering that produces spiritual

630
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,020
 perseverance. Romans five tells us this.

631
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,180
 They say, but we also Romans five, verses three and four.

632
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,340
 But we also glory in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces

633
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,540
 perseverance, perseverance, character and character hope.

634
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,740
 And so you become godly through the suffering.

635
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,260
 You become a holy through the suffering.

636
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,460
 You become sanctified through this suffering.

637
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,780
 And in your life, it produces hope.

638
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,140
 It serves as a reminder that you're not home yet.

639
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,540
 Like this is not your home.

640
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,980
 So every day you wake up, you experience suffering.

641
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,700
 I'm not home yet.

642
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,340
 No, no, I'm going to I'm going to be home, I'm just not there yet.

643
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,420
 Do you know one of the reasons that I don't look forward to heaven?

644
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,540
 One of the reasons that I don't look

645
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,100
 forward to heaven is because I'm looking forward to Belize.

646
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,660
 Let me explain.

647
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,060
 We're going in May.

648
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,060
 We're going on vacation to Belize, planned a family vacation.

649
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,140
 We're going with a couple other families and we're going to stay there.

650
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,620
 And I'm really excited about I've got a long kind of run through April.

651
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,620
 I love what I do. Don't confuse that.

652
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,700
 I really enjoy what I get to do.

653
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,220
 But we have this church leaders conference here, April 19 through the 21st.

654
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,460
 And so there's going to be, you know,

655
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,740
 750 church leaders from around the world in this place.

656
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,740
 And I'm kind of helping with that.

657
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,180
 And there's a lot going on here.

658
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,100
 And so I'm looking forward to this vacation in May.

659
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,780
 And when I think about what I'm looking forward to most right now, if I'm

660
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,420
 completely transparent with you and in my own sin, it's Belize in my flesh,

661
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,660
 when my flesh is driving, it's Belize, which is stupid, which is silly,

662
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
 which is wrong, which is ignorant.

663
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,780
 But I mean, just today I was on VRBO looking at where we're staying.

664
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,260
 I'm like, oh, this would be amazing.

665
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,740
 You know, I mean, don't you realize that

666
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,780
 exceptional or it's not like where you guys stay.

667
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,180
 But I'm like, for me, I'm like, this is awesome.

668
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,260
 I can't wait.

669
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,140
 But what I'm not doing in that moment, I'm not like, and I can't wait for heaven.

670
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,860
 Also, that's going to be amazing, too.

671
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,660
 Now, I'm just like, please, right, because I pursue my own comforts.

672
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,620
 I'm like an out of shape athlete.

673
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,340
 I'm not persevering to the eternal reward.

674
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,100
 I'm taking these little pit stops of comfort along the way.

675
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,540
 And I'm looking forward to them.

676
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,980
 And some of you are doing the same weekend to weekend, party to party,

677
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,940
 club to club, bar to bar, relationship to relationship, vacation to vacation.

678
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,300
 You're not thinking you're going through this like that.

679
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,020
 I cannot wait to be with you because this is so hard.

680
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,860
 I long to be with you.

681
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,540
 I'm looking forward to it forever and ever and ever.

682
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,060
 A place with no weeping, no crying, no tears, no suffering, no cancer,

683
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:13,500
 no breakups, no heartbreak, no job loss, no insecurities.

684
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,300
 Now, I just can't wait for a vacation, man.

685
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,580
 Can't wait for Friday.

686
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:25,500
 Can't wait to just endure this week so that I can make it to the end.

687
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,460
 We don't look forward to heaven.

688
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,940
 Not like this talks about we're in here, we're in the air,

689
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,660
 we're in the air, we can inherit a kingdom in Christ's kingdom.

690
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,380
 Belize.

691
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,900
 The second

692
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,460
 benefit is not just suffering for Christ, but

693
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,500
 you share in his glory as heirs with Christ.

694
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,660
 Now this my friends and I looked at this

695
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,700
 today and like, I don't even know how to explain that.

696
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,460
 You know, you share in his glories as heirs with Christ.

697
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,660
 I've said it before, like I've had friends who are trust fund babies,

698
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,140
 like just meaning that when they turn 30, they're going to inherit a lot of money.

699
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,220
 And I'm just like, what are you ever sad about?

700
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,420
 You know, like, why are you ever sad?

701
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,060
 Like you're going to be wealthy.

702
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,660
 Like, what are you worried about your job for?

703
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,700
 You don't need a job. You know, like what is going on?

704
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,580
 And the reality for all of us is we are trust fund babies

705
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:35,460
 because we've been adopted by the one who owns the cattle on a thousand hills.

706
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,180
 It says eternal riches, glorious riches.

707
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,500
 Christ is going to share his glory with us.

708
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,180
 I don't even know how to explain that to you.

709
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,900
 And I'm out of time. Praise God.

710
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,900
 So we are adopted as heirs to the kingdom.

711
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,900
 Consider this for a moment, like

712
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,780
 think about the royal family, like think about Prince William.

713
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,380
 David showed me an article today that that I mean, I didn't even know this.

714
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,220
 Like those cats have jobs.

715
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,140
 Like he flies a helicopter for some ambulance company.

716
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,300
 Like that's his profession.

717
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,540
 I thought he just sat up in the castle and like played golf and stuff.

718
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,700
 And like they've got jobs,

719
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,900
 they've got titles like CEO and director and COO and, you know,

720
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,380
 director of operations, whatever it is, right.

721
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,420
 For him, it's pilot of some helicopter

722
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,420
 for people who need an ambulance and and.

723
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,900
 But that's Prince William, man.

724
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,620
 Like there is no title he's ever going to have higher than Prince William.

725
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,220
 Like whoever he does, like if he's flipping

726
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,060
 burgers at McDonald's, whatever he's whatever he's doing for the rest of his life.

727
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,340
 That's Prince William.

728
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,020
 That's who he is.

729
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:52,300
 He will never have a title greater than that unless.

730
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,580
 Unless he's son of the king of kings.

731
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:01,860
 In which case he is the son of God, his child.

732
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,860
 And that's a bigger title and that's a title he carries forever and ever and ever

733
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:09,740
 because make no mistake about it, 200 years from now, it doesn't matter that he's

734
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:15,220
 Prince William, all that's matter is who was he to God,

735
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:21,020
 the creator of the heavens and the earth and what's crazy about that, guys.

736
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,220
 It's true for you.

737
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:29,020
 You will never have a title bigger than daughter of God, son of God.

738
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,380
 And so somebody one day or maybe today they might call you the CEO.

739
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,940
 Don't matter.

740
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,460
 The son of God, the daughter of God, and maybe they've called you other things.

741
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,020
 Maybe they called you player.

742
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,900
 Maybe they called you Pim.

743
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,540
 Son of God.

744
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,900
 Maybe they called you slut.

745
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,780
 Maybe that was a title you wore behind your back.

746
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,700
 You're the daughter to the king of kings.

747
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,340
 That's who you are.

748
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,260
 If you embrace that, it changes everything.

749
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,380
 You are not the girl who's been divorced.

750
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,460
 You are not the girl who had an abortion.

751
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,940
 You are not the girl who did those terrible things.

752
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,460
 Your daughter to the king.

753
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,660
 Those things don't mark you.

754
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:15,820
 Nothing marks you more than that reality who you belong to.

755
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,020
 And it will be the greatest name, the greatest title.

756
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,820
 That's a humbling thing because you thought you were really important.

757
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,180
 Young man, you thought you really made something of yourself.

758
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,980
 You built a palace.

759
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,980
 No, man, the greatest thing about you

760
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,540
 is not the trinkets and the treasures that you built in this temporary place,

761
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,180
 but who you're going to be in paradise, who you can be right now.

762
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,100
 Right now.

763
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,900
 That's an amazing reality.

764
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:53,300
 As God's children, we don't just get Christ's inheritance in the future, though we do.

765
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,660
 We are privileged to suffer for him now.

766
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,420
 And so in summary, our behavior points to whom we belong.

767
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,700
 God's spirit makes us sons and daughters, not slaves.

768
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:12,780
 And the benefit of being God's children is that we get to trust him in suffering

769
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,980
 and share in his glorious heirs with Christ.

770
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,140
 Close with this, there's a there's a part of me

771
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:25,340
 that just felt ill equipped for this message because I have so many friends

772
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,820
 that have adopted and I haven't and I just I wanted to reach out to them.

773
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,980
 And one just brought home a little girl from China.

774
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,140
 And I got to pray with her through the process and be involved and watch this

775
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,700
 beautiful thing take place as mother and daughter are connected.

776
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,580
 And.

777
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,780
 And I reached out to her yesterday and I just said, hey, what did you learn about?

778
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,860
 God, through that process and friends,

779
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,860
 she wrote me one of the most profound emails I've ever read in my life.

780
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,980
 It will preach louder, I think this is true than any sermon I've ever heard.

781
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,940
 And I can't read you the entire email,

782
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,340
 but I want to share with you just some highlights when I asked her, hey,

783
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,140
 what did you learn?

784
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,260
 And she brought home this three and a half year old little girl from China.

785
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,300
 And she said, I learned about my own brokenness.

786
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,940
 The most painful part of the process is

787
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:23,060
 that you have to understand or choose rather what disabilities you're willing

788
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:26,260
 to live with, she said, the list, it's horrific.

789
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,460
 She says there are kids born without eyes,

790
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,900
 deaf, mute, chronic disease, viruses, missing limbs,

791
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,780
 deformed hearts or missing eternal organs.

792
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,580
 And these kids are so hard to place.

793
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,260
 There's millions of them and they will go through life without parents,

794
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,940
 without anyone to take care of them.

795
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,140
 And I know by choosing not one of them,

796
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,140
 I'm choosing to let them sit there in the orphanage.

797
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,220
 And she says to look at their disabilities.

798
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,340
 I know it's costly.

799
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,540
 It will be more expensive to take care of them than someone else.

800
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,540
 But what I learned.

801
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,220
 Is that God looks at my own disabilities, my own insecurities,

802
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,860
 the areas of my life where I fall short,

803
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,860
 the things I find identity in that I shouldn't.

804
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,580
 And he says, you're mine.

805
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,060
 I would joyfully pay the price for you.

806
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,980
 I would joyfully care for you.

807
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,940
 You're mine.

808
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:17,140
 She talked about the pain she felt knowing that her daughter sat in an orphanage,

809
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,820
 she says she had learned how God must feels as he waits for us.

810
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,340
 I'll read this to you, she said, for three plus years,

811
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,140
 I know that made cried out in the orphanage and no one came.

812
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
 Her daughter's name is May.

813
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,740
 No one comforter comforted her.

814
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,020
 Or she stayed hungry or dirty in her crib

815
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,260
 because there was not enough care in the orphanage.

816
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,660
 I grieve the years she didn't have someone telling her how precious she is,

817
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:47,820
 what a gift she is, that she was that she wasn't held close by someone.

818
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,980
 I hate that I missed that time with her, and she says, but yet,

819
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,420
 isn't that how God must feel when he's freely offered us to be his son

820
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,140
 and daughter and we continue to run in the world like this world has something

821
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,300
 to offer us, we continue to run from him.

822
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,980
 We continue to reject him.

823
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,740
 We sit in our filth and glory in it.

824
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,500
 She says she learned about God as our provider.

825
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,620
 She talked about this profound reality of of the spirit of an orphan,

826
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,660
 how May was deprived of a lot, and when she brought her home,

827
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,980
 what she would do is she would hoard everything at the beginning.

828
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,260
 She would take bags of toys to bed with her.

829
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,500
 She was afraid that there wouldn't be any in the morning.

830
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,060
 At first, she would overeat.

831
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,700
 Whenever she sat down for a meal, she would gorge herself with food.

832
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,380
 Not sure yet that the next meal would be coming or enough.

833
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,660
 And she says she watches on as she slowly

834
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:53,140
 learns that she is loved, cared for and provided for by someone who loves her.

835
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:56,500
 She said, do we not live in survival mode?

836
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,860
 Wondering where the next paycheck is going to be or how we're going to make

837
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,100
 it or what we're going to do or if we'll ever have a relationship?

838
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,740
 Do we not constantly worry about the things in this world?

839
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:12,980
 And reject the promises of God that he's going to provide our every need.

840
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,980
 She says she's learned so much about how we were, and this is beautiful to me,

841
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,300
 designed to be delighted in.

842
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,660
 She talked about this thing, I had never heard of it, but.

843
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,460
 It's called indiscriminate affection.

844
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:35,900
 And it's when a child feels abandoned that they will seek affection from anyone,

845
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,020
 she says she was so scared when she sat in that hotel in China and her little girl

846
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,780
 may would go up to any stranger with her arms up.

847
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,260
 Will you hold me? Will you hold me?

848
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,060
 Will you hold me?

849
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,500
 She says she watched as she would perform

850
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,140
 for strangers as they came over and she would introduce them,

851
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:57,660
 that she she thought she had to perform for their acceptance,

852
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:03,140
 almost like a puppy dog in a pound, hoping someone's going to take them home.

853
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,460
 She doesn't she know she's mine.

854
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,620
 Doesn't she knows that that I love her, that I'm going to provide for her.

855
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,300
 That she doesn't need to pursue that affection from anyone else right now,

856
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,420
 that I'm her mommy.

857
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,020
 She says, I think about my own life, I've

858
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,260
 pursued affection from men, how I pursued affection from others,

859
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,260
 how I've needed attention from this world.

860
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:38,540
 That my father gives me freely, readily, even now.

861
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,380
 And she talked about the price.

862
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,460
 She says she learned about the payment.

863
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,260
 She didn't have a ton of money, but she paid a lot of money to bring this little

864
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,940
 child home, she took vacation time, she went with unpaid leave,

865
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,060
 she bought very expensive plane tickets and paid tens and tens and tens of

866
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:02,060
 thousands of dollars to bring this child home and to care for her.

867
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,860
 She went without sleep.

868
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,700
 She went in.

869
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,900
 Seasons of discomfort.

870
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:14,900
 She cried, longing to see this person.

871
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,620
 And yet, God, for the joy set before him.

872
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,380
 Endured the cross.

873
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,060
 And said to you.

874
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,340
 Very specifically, you.

875
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,340
 You're worth it.

876
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,420
 That's what you need to hear tonight.

877
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,660
 Christ paid everything for you, God paid

878
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,300
 everything to adopt you as his own, to love you.

879
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,780
 And he says you're worth it.

880
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,860
 I'll end with this quote from Philippians, it couldn't be more appropriate,

881
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:51,980
 he said this, if I could sum up the whole Bible in one statement, it would be this.

882
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,660
 God gets his family back.

883
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,460
 The whole Bible is about God going after his children.

884
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,780
 That's what he's doing right now, two kinds of people in the room.

885
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,020
 Those that are children of God,

886
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,340
 you just need to be reminded that you have a spirit so that you might be led by him.

887
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,580
 You belong to the king of kings.

888
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,820
 And there's those of you that have not been adopted.

889
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,980
 You continue to perform for this world, continuing to pretend to be good.

890
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,180
 And God is ready to receive you as his son and daughter right now.

891
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:37,020
 Let me pray that we would not return to him as slaves, but be led by his spirit.

892
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,980
 Father, thank you for this chapter in this amazing book.

893
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,740
 Would you help us to be princesses and princes with a purpose?

894
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,460
 Father, would you help us to live our lives for you, with intentionality for you,

895
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,380
 not performing for you, but because of what you've done for us,

896
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:03,300
 not seeking acceptance from you, but living, knowing that we have been accepted.

897
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,020
 Father, thank you for the way that you love us so much that you've seen your only

898
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:12,980
 son, Jesus Christ, giving us a spirit, not one that makes us slaves,

899
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:19,700
 that one that performs for you under the law, but one that has fulfilled the law.

900
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,460
 One that leads us to righteousness, one that sanctifies us,

901
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,820
 one that conforms us to the image and the character of your son.

902
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,860
 Would you do that now as we sing to you?

903
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,300
 And I just got to tell you something.

904
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,300
 It's really important.

905
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,100
 And I need you to listen.

906
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,060
 And more than listen, I need you to believe me.

907
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:50,460
 I've kind of bet the life I've kind of bet everything I've kind of I kind of have

908
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,780
 gone all in on what I'm about to say and.

909
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:57,900
 From a whole life on the line, and

910
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,740
 I think I'm asking you to do the same and.

911
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,500
 It's a really simple thing.

912
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,580
 And yet I think we'll spend the rest of our

913
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:15,060
 lives on this Earth trying to understand the depth.

914
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,260
 Of these three words.

915
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,420
 Without further delay, it's this.

916
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,260
 God loves you.

917
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,060
 He's crazy about you, man.

918
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,820
 He loves you so stinking much.

919
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:41,980
 And since the beginning of time, he since the beginning of creation of humans,

920
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:48,140
 he's been trying to show you been trying to get your attention.

921
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,820
 And so now my question, this is me talking now.

922
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,820
 I'm just wondering how long you're not going to believe that.

923
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:02,420
 How long you're going to continue to pursue worth in stupid things.

924
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:07,500
 How long you're going to continue to chase trinkets and treasures?

925
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,380
 How long you're going to worry like, is it 10 years?

926
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,460
 Is it 20 years? Is it 30 years?

927
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,380
 Is it 50 years? Is it the rest of your existence?

928
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:22,020
 You're going to live in bondage to fear in bondage to seeking significance.

929
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:29,820
 And I just urge you right now by the power of God's Holy Spirit, who is enough

930
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:35,980
 to stop and to trust him because he loves you.

931
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,220
 And he's gone to great lengths to show you.
