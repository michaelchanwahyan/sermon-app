00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,840
 Yeah, yeah, you know that lyric?

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,800
 That's some bad advice.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,880
 Y'all were singing it.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,320
 You were letting it wash over you, right?

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,200
 Not what was true and honorable and right and pure and lovely,

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
 whatever of good repute.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,040
 If there's anything worthy of excellence or--

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,580
 anything excellent or worthy of praise,

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,120
 let your mind dwell on these things.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,160
 That song, man, it just washes over you.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,320
 And you're going to start to do this, don't you?

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,560
 We're young.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,560
 The Bible says, man, the glory of young man is their strength.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,280
 In other words, you think you're never going to die, man.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,440
 We're going to put the sun out.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,680
 I'm going to be around for a long time.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,640
 And we are young.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,760
 And we can burn bright.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,920
 And we can burn long.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,640
 And we can burn forever.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,840
 And there is nothing to do but to light it up.

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,440
 Get it while you can.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,080
 This is your 20s, man.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,620
 This is just the practice round.

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,240
 Let's go around a few times.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,520
 Let's not miss out now.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,840
 We'll have a chance to settle down later.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,960
 Ever heard that advice?

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,760
 Ever thought it?

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,560
 Are you living it?

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
 A lot of you are.

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,440
 Our buddy JP, I know him well, right?

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,840
 This was his story.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,200
 You know, he kind of grew up around church in a cultural way.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,280
 But then he went to college.

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,960
 And he drifted.

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,720
 Because when you're just around something

39
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,280
 in a cultural way, whatever culture you're around

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,760
 is going to jump on you.

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,440
 And it jumped all over JP, man.

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
 He was being totally influenced by it.

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,680
 He was letting a lot of alcohol run through him.

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,480
 And he was trying to run through everything

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
 he could put his hands on.

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,120
 And his life was a wreck.

47
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,000
 And after a week, man, he couldn't sleep.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,720
 He was nervous.

49
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,680
 He was laying in bed.

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
 He picked up the phone.

51
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,240
 He called a friend.

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,880
 And he said, man, I am stressed out.

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
 I don't know what to do.

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,080
 I'm supposed to be having the time of my life.

55
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,840
 I'm doing all the things that people say will make you

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
 have the time of your life.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,520
 What am I supposed to do?

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,160
 And the advice he got on the other end of that phone

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,520
 was this, man, hey, that's what we do, bro.

60
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,480
 This is the years.

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,760
 You go get it while you can.

62
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,840
 Treat yourself.

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,340
 Right?

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,920
 This is the day to live it up.

65
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,160
 You can grow up later.

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,400
 Right?

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,080
 You be a lug.

68
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
 You be a lesbian until graduation.

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,200
 And then you can go find you a man and raise the house,

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
 get you a little white picket fence.

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
 Ever heard that?

72
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,640
 It's worked its way into your vocabulary.

73
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,840
 And if there is any lie that is built into youth,

74
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,440
 it is I can get serious about my life later.

75
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,880
 Let me just tell you something.

76
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,560
 You ever heard the phrase, you've been around sports?

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
 You're going to play like you practice?

78
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,480
 I hear it all the time.

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,160
 You end up playing like you practice.

80
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 We've talked about this.

81
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,280
 Some of the bad advice we've already discussed here,

82
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,000
 try it before you buy it.

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,320
 But what we don't know is when we experience intense pleasure,

84
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,240
 our body shoots off chemicals that literally hardwires

85
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,520
 our brain and all of our senses to be

86
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,360
 attached to certain behaviors.

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,880
 It identifies certain opportunities,

88
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,360
 certain experiences with intense pleasure.

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,000
 And our brain wants to run back to those things.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,320
 We become hardwired because we are practicing this.

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,480
 We're practicing, practicing this

92
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,680
 is what you do to find pleasure.

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
 And bro, you just can't just switch that off.

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,280
 Because you have ingrained in your mind

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,080
 that is the way to roll.

96
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,920
 When you start to say, get it while you can, get it now,

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,960
 treat yourself, you ain't treating yourself.

98
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,400
 You are training yourself.

99
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,240
 That song, man, we're going to burn bright in the sun.

100
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
 We're never going to have any bad times.

101
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,920
 That song in itself already exposes its own lie.

102
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,680
 You ever listen to all the lyrics?

103
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,240
 He's talking about the fact that some other dude there

104
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,560
 in sunglasses is trying to move in on you.

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
 And the reason you're away from me

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,160
 is because I left a scar on you that hurts you.

107
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,280
 I ain't made it right yet.

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,320
 But maybe you'll get drunk enough tonight.

109
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,600
 And maybe when you just want to fall down, I'll be there

110
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
 and I'll carry you home.

111
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,640
 And then he wants to just sing that siren song

112
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,560
 one more time, I'll be that guy that'll help you

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,040
 get that life that you want.

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,280
 That song, that lie's been around for a long time.

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,480
 You scroll that back 30 years.

116
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,360
 And there was a song when I was your age.

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,800
 It was the summer before I came to really understand

118
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,560
 what I want to talk to you about tonight,

119
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,400
 about where life can really be found.

120
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,960
 And it's a song called "Only the Good Die Young," man.

121
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,200
 I'll play it for you in just a second.

122
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,360
 It's the idea that if you want to live a good life,

123
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,980
 if you don't want to get it while you can,

124
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,160
 if you don't want to treat yourself,

125
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,760
 if you want to be burdened by the religion

126
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,640
 and the laws of old,

127
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,640
 then you're going to die a young death.

128
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
 Over here, we're living it up.

129
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,320
 This is where the party is.

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,660
 This is where it's brighter than the sun.

131
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,720
 That lie's been around for a long time.

132
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,480
 Here's the way I heard it, okay, in the 70s.

133
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,820
 Check it out.

134
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,720
 All right, man, hey, I remember hearing that.

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,080
 I sung it, I sung it all summer long.

136
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,840
 I was convinced at that line,

137
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,920
 and Billy Joel writes in there,

138
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,400
 "Come on, Virginia," is the reason he chose that name.

139
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,900
 That little stained glass curtain you're hiding behind,

140
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,600
 all right, he's saying, "You got to come out

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,780
 "where the sun really shines, where the sun is.

142
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,200
 "You're getting muted sunlight.

143
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,360
 "You're being lied to.

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,360
 "Come on, Virginia, get on out here where life is."

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 That song's been around for a long time.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,300
 You wanna know how long?

147
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,960
 Not just 30 years ago, thousands of years.

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
 And if there is a loving father,

149
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,020
 he would do everything he could

150
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,280
 to put a new song in your heart.

151
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,860
 See, this is what happens when you really understand

152
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,240
 who God is and that he's not trying to rip you off,

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
 he's trying to set you free.

154
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,320
 It changes your tune, man.

155
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,160
 It changes the way you roll,

156
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,760
 and you're not gonna go get you some.

157
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,560
 You're gonna go get all you can of where real life resides.

158
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,480
 Can I just tell you something, man?

159
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,400
 Nobody looks at you and thinks you're a fool

160
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
 because you're being seduced by the things

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
 that you're being seduced by

162
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,200
 because that is the story of humankind,

163
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,840
 and it's especially the story of youth.

164
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,500
 If there's a verse in my Bible

165
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,800
 that I have seen evidenced again and again

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,440
 in the lives of men and in my life, it's this.

167
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,720
 It's in Ecclesiastes chapter eight, verse 11.

168
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,260
 It says this, "Because the sentence against an evil deed

169
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,880
 "is not executed quickly, therefore the hearts of men

170
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,880
 "among them are given fully to do evil."

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,360
 In other words, you get away with something,

172
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,540
 you go, that didn't really hurt, or that wasn't too bad,

173
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,600
 or it hadn't stung enough yet,

174
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,320
 and so you just go back for more,

175
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,160
 and you think that, hey, I think I'm gonna be the one

176
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
 that gets away with this.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,400
 I'm gonna be the one that does party now,

178
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,840
 and I will grow up later.

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
 This is just the practice round.

180
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,040
 Actually, it's not even the practice round.

181
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,500
 I'm not training for anything.

182
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,500
 This is recess, and it's time for me to play.

183
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,120
 I'll grow up later, but what you don't understand

184
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,760
 is that you are growing into something

185
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,200
 that you're not gonna like.

186
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,800
 I love, you know, different signs that you see

187
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
 around when you're driving.

188
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,880
 You know, I can remember, my buddy and I

189
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,160
 were driving through Arkansas one time.

190
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
 We were in this little, little town, and it said,

191
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,240
 you know, such and such Arkansas, home of Jim Bad News Brown,

192
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,960
 or Jim Bad News Barnes, rather,

193
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,160
 and we thought, that is hilarious.

194
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,480
 We have no idea who Jim Bad News was.

195
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,280
 We literally, in this little town in Arkansas,

196
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,160
 drove to what you would imagine is there,

197
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,560
 like this little, you know, like malt shop,

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,020
 barber shop kind of thing.

199
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,440
 We walked in, and we go, who's Jim Bad News Barnes?

200
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,240
 And they go, oh, you know about Bad News?

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
 And some five old men in the corner

202
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
 started talking about Jim Bad News Barnes,

203
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
 how amazing he was.

204
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,920
 They go, was Jim Bad News still living?

205
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
 They go, no, but his mama does,

206
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,120
 so we went over to Jim Bad News Barnes' mama's house,

207
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,840
 (congregation laughs)

208
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,040
 it's the first time I ever had fried green tomatoes.

209
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,400
 We just knocked on the door, literally,

210
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,960
 just to make an experience, we knocked on the door,

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
 we go, we understand Jim Bad News Barnes used to live here,

212
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,200
 and she goes, yes, he did, and she opened the door,

213
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,600
 showed us all the pictures, all the newspapers she had cut,

214
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
 I had to play in the NBA way back in the day

215
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,400
 before I even knew about it, for the Celtics,

216
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,440
 and we sat down there, we had fried green tomatoes,

217
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,920
 and laughed with this woman,

218
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 and just talked about how amazing,

219
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,040
 now, she lives in a town that's well-known

220
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,640
 because of her son who grew up there.

221
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,400
 I love street signs, I love town signs,

222
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,920
 I always read 'em, I saw one, no kidding,

223
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,940
 one time, it said this, it said, it was a gas station,

224
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,600
 it said, we sell Mexican food,

225
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,560
 we have gas on the exact same sign, right there.

226
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,520
 (congregation laughs)

227
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,960
 I go, how obvious is that, right there, okay?

228
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,680
 There's a street sign I've never seen

229
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,780
 'cause I've never been to Alaska,

230
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,840
 but the street sign says this,

231
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,840
 when you leave certain parts of cities in Alaska,

232
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,600
 especially as you move towards the colder months,

233
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
 which there's a lot of 'em up there

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,140
 if you haven't paid attention to your world geography,

235
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,360
 once cars start to travel, what they do is they make ruts,

236
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,820
 and from town to town, you literally get in a rut,

237
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,640
 and you drive in that rut from one town to another

238
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
 until you get to a turnaround, you come back,

239
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,200
 and so, this rut goes to this town,

240
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
 this rut goes to that town,

241
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,040
 and so, there's all kinds of signs that says,

242
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
 choose your rut wisely, you'll be in it

243
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,120
 for the next 60 miles, the next 200 miles,

244
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,720
 the next 50 miles, let me just tell you something,

245
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
 it's a lie that you can jump the rut.

246
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,960
 This, treat yourself, this, get it while you can,

247
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
 this is, I'll grow up later,

248
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,440
 what you're doing is you're jumping in a rut,

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,480
 and some of you guys will sit there,

250
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,640
 and you'll go, how did I get here?

251
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
 Why can't I turn this around?

252
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
 Now, I'm gonna tell you tonight,

253
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
 about a God who will restore the years

254
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
 that the locusts have eaten,

255
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,560
 and though your sins are red as scarlet,

256
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
 he'll make them white as snow,

257
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,360
 but you gotta start dealing with some of the lies

258
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,180
 that you've listened to,

259
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,640
 there's another verse in Scripture that says this,

260
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,520
 it says that we should encourage each other,

261
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,420
 day after day, as long as it's called today,

262
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,520
 so we won't be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

263
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,360
 Part of the deceitfulness of sin,

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
 is that we think we're gonna be the one

265
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
 that plays with it, not get owned by it.

266
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,360
 We're gonna be the one that thinks we can beat it.

267
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,720
 We're gonna be the one that thinks

268
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,280
 that it's not gonna grab a hold of us,

269
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,720
 and train us, till we become somebody

270
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
 we never thought we'd be.

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,520
 I told you, these songs have been around for a long time.

272
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,840
 You guys know who Homer is?

273
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,560
 Not Simpson, all right, all right.

274
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,520
 The one who wrote the Iliad,

275
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,000
 that book you didn't read in high school,

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
 remember that, or college?

277
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
 That Homer.

278
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
 He wrote about Ulysses, or Odysseus, right?

279
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,420
 And even the ancient Greeks understood

280
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,480
 there are certain siren songs,

281
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,380
 you remember that little part of that mythological part

282
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,380
 of Odysseus' story, where every man that sailed

283
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,640
 by this island, where those three sisters were,

284
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,160
 whose song was so amazing, and so sweet,

285
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,280
 and so seductive, that they couldn't help

286
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,560
 but navigate their sails, and turn the rudder,

287
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,600
 so that their ship would sail towards that beautiful song,

288
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,720
 and life after life was lost there,

289
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,900
 because every ship was wrecked on the jagged reefs

290
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,760
 that were there in that bay,

291
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,360
 where they thought they were sailing to life,

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,400
 but they knew they were sailing to death.

293
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,960
 Can I give you the antidote to the siren song

294
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,800
 of fun, of Billy Joel?

295
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,200
 You guys remember what Odysseus did?

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,880
 He wanted to hear the song, which was a bit foolish,

297
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,840
 but at least he had the sense to tie himself to the mast.

298
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,880
 He had all the other men on his ship

299
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,200
 put wax in their ears to prohibit them

300
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,280
 from listening to this seductive song

301
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,260
 that ruins the lives of men, and he said to them,

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,520
 no matter what I say to you,

303
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,240
 you do not cut me off that pole.

304
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,240
 You strap me to the mast, until we get past that harbor

305
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,800
 to the other side.

306
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,960
 Don't you listen.

307
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,800
 You better make sure that your mind is not perverted

308
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,640
 by what is not true, what is not honorable,

309
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,240
 what is not right, what is not pure,

310
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,140
 what is not lovely, what is not worthy of praise,

311
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,160
 that isn't excellent.

312
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,120
 You gotta put wax in your ears on that stuff,

313
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,860
 or you're gonna keep sailing towards it.

314
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,280
 It's amazing, man, we know that song

315
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,440
 is the reason I kinda played that before we came out here.

316
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,280
 Those songs are seductive, and we don't know it,

317
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,300
 but it's just moving us towards this idea

318
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,520
 that God's not good.

319
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,340
 If God was good, he'd let me run on over there

320
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,940
 to where all my friends are, higher than the empire.

321
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,640
 And it's a lie.

322
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,100
 And I've lived long enough to see it.

323
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,380
 You guys know that a number of years ago,

324
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,220
 we started putting on the packages of cigarettes.

325
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,060
 We didn't used to do that.

326
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,460
 The tobacco industry had a major grip on our economy,

327
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,500
 and the lobbyists of the tobacco industry

328
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 were major informing the way Congress made laws,

329
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,860
 and eventually, when they showed

330
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,180
 the addictive power of nicotine,

331
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,060
 they started to put on cigarette packages

332
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,000
 warning labels that said, hey, man, listen,

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,340
 this could cost you your health,

334
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,540
 and maybe even your life, you remember that?

335
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,580
 Most of us didn't grow up in a smoking generation.

336
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,740
 I did, my parents smoked when I was young.

337
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,940
 Almost everybody did.

338
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,140
 In cars, unfiltered cigarettes.

339
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,740
 My grandfather, I hardly ever remember him

340
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,940
 without a cigarette in his mouth.

341
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,860
 But let me just tell you, man,

342
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,100
 the addictive nature of tobacco is overwhelming.

343
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,540
 It's unbelievable, it ruins,

344
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,140
 and I'm looking for just pieces here to walk you through it.

345
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,120
 Person after person, there's not an aspect of your body,

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,700
 not a single organ that isn't affected by it.

347
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,060
 There are little hair-like creatures on your lungs

348
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,540
 that move like this, and the tar and the nicotine

349
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,540
 clogs them up, and it keeps the healthy part of your lungs

350
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,680
 from trapping the poisons and the toxins

351
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,760
 that you're exposed to, that ultimately,

352
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,660
 because it can't clean it, cancer sticks to your lungs.

353
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,240
 Still, 90% of all lung cancer patients,

354
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,720
 it's still the number one cause of death in our country

355
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,120
 from cancer is lung cancer,

356
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,500
 and 90% of lung cancer patients are smokers.

357
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,020
 Here's a picture of a healthy lung, right here.

358
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,200
 The little black specks are just what happens

359
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,360
 when you live in the city.

360
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,880
 It's a lung, a healthy lung from a city

361
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
 that's pollution that happens.

362
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 This is the picture of a smoker's lung.

363
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,240
 Look at that.

364
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,440
 Now, you look at that white part,

365
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,480
 you go, well, there's still some part

366
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,320
 that's not contaminated.

367
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
 That's cancer.

368
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,560
 That's what killed 'em.

369
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,280
 And you look at that, what's so amazing is people go,

370
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,120
 well, man, I don't inhale.

371
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
 Even if I inhale, I'm exhaling all of it.

372
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,860
 Do you know that when you take in a cigarette,

373
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,440
 when you exhale, 90% of the smoke that you inhale,

374
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,560
 no matter how much you did, 90% of what you inhaled

375
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,000
 is not exhaled.

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,720
 It sticks in you, and it creates a corrosive element

377
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,440
 not just to your lungs, but to every part of your body.

378
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,840
 And people go, I'll just smoke for a little bit,

379
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,760
 I'll get rid of it, and then there's addictive nature

380
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,960
 to the behavior, just as addictive as heroin.

381
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,720
 And so eventually, we just started to warn people,

382
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,240
 you best not mess with that,

383
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,600
 even if it makes you look cool when you're young.

384
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,000
 Probably not as many smokers here as there used to be,

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,280
 but those of you that smoke know about the addictive nature,

386
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,680
 and some of you guys go, who will smoke?

387
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,720
 That's just nasty.

388
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,760
 But you know, every generation's got its cigarettes, man.

389
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,360
 This generation's cigarettes is just, hey,

390
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,860
 same sex experimentation.

391
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,600
 Just kinda everybody does it.

392
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,840
 I'll just jump off that little track later.

393
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,680
 Or who knows what it might be.

394
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,860
 But it's out there, and it's alive.

395
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,260
 This song's been around a lot longer than Homer.

396
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,840
 About 400, 500 years before Homer,

397
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,080
 there was another little piece of literature

398
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,400
 that was written, it's called Proverbs.

399
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 Proverbs I love because it is written to fools like me,

400
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,480
 and they're short, and they're easy to follow.

401
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,920
 Listen to Proverbs chapter one, are you ready?

402
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,680
 The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel,

403
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,300
 to know wisdom and instruction,

404
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,080
 to discern the sayings of understanding,

405
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,320
 to receive instruction in wise behavior,

406
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,880
 righteousness, justice, and equity.

407
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,680
 Man, that's good stuff right there.

408
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,520
 To give prudence to the naive, the impressionable,

409
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,160
 those who think they've got it all figured out

410
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,460
 who don't need help from anybody.

411
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,360
 To the youth, knowledge and discretion.

412
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,440
 A wise man is gonna hear and increase in learning,

413
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,720
 and a man of understanding will acquire wisdom.

414
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,140
 That's the job of a young man or young woman,

415
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,200
 is to become wise.

416
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,680
 The word wise means skilled in living.

417
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,480
 If you're not skilled in living, you're in trouble.

418
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,600
 When you get around kids, kids don't know the difference

419
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,520
 between a rope and a snake, a curb and a cliff.

420
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,400
 And they need somebody to protect them.

421
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,040
 And I'm just telling you, when you're young,

422
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,440
 you think you've got it all figured out,

423
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,880
 that previous generations jacked the stuff,

424
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,920
 and maybe they got away with it,

425
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,960
 or it looks like they got away with it,

426
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,160
 but I'm gonna get away with it.

427
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,640
 Now's recess.

428
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,640
 I'm not training for anything, I'm just having fun.

429
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,700
 It says to understand a proverb and a figure,

430
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,820
 verse six, the words of the wise and their riddles.

431
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,640
 I love that, the words of the wise and their riddles.

432
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,540
 I love riddles.

433
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,460
 And what it's saying is, sometimes,

434
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,260
 what it means to live a skilled life

435
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
 is like a riddle to some people, you don't understand it.

436
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,700
 Sometimes you hear older people say things,

437
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,140
 and you kind of cock your head like a dog

438
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,060
 who's hearing a strange noise,

439
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,260
 you can't really figure it out.

440
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,380
 Even in Proverbs, when you go and read,

441
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,260
 in Proverbs chapter 14, it says that,

442
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,900
 it says, "Where the oxen are,

443
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,560
 "where there are no oxen, the manger is clean.

444
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,900
 "But much increase comes by the strength of the ox."

445
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,300
 And you're kind of like,

446
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,460
 that's not like something my dad would say,

447
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,200
 it makes no sense to me.

448
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,140
 It's a riddle, and what it basically talks about is,

449
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,100
 hey, if you want a nice, clean, exact life

450
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,780
 with no trouble, no manure laying around, okay,

451
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,020
 then don't have any oxen.

452
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,060
 Be an inflexible person who likes everything

453
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,420
 in its perfect order and doesn't have your life interrupted.

454
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,180
 But here's the thing, oxen produce a lot of good.

455
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,580
 But relationships are messy, friendships are messy,

456
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,900
 community is messy.

457
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,340
 And if you don't want any messes,

458
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,780
 then just go ahead and isolate yourself.

459
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,540
 But much increase comes from the strength of an ox.

460
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,460
 It's like a riddle.

461
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,300
 Don't you love riddles?

462
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,260
 I love riddles, right?

463
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,340
 I ask my kids all the time, hey, hey, kids,

464
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,040
 you know what happens when you throw a white hat

465
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,880
 into the Red Sea?

466
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,820
 And they go, I don't know.

467
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,660
 What happens, y'all know?

468
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,220
 It gets wet, that's the answer, all right?

469
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,500
 So you're too smart for yourself, you overthink, right?

470
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,280
 But I love riddles like this one.

471
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,220
 So I like to ask my kids this one.

472
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,120
 What's so delicate that even saying its name will break it?

473
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,100
 That's right, I heard it, silence, silence.

474
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,420
 How about this one?

475
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,740
 What is something that you throw away the outside

476
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,740
 and you cook the inside, then you eat the outside

477
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,040
 and throw away the inside?

478
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,780
 I'll give it to you again, you ready?

479
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,720
 I love riddles.

480
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,620
 You throw away the outside, you eat the inside.

481
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,460
 Excuse me, you throw away the outside, you cook the inside,

482
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,020
 then you eat the outside and throw away the inside.

483
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,060
 Ear of corn, isn't that good?

484
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,180
 I like that one, yeah, yeah, yeah.

485
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,580
 All right, here's a good one, all right?

486
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,300
 This is one because, yeah, you're like,

487
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,860
 (growling)

488
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,540
 Should've known that, should've known that, right?

489
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,780
 That's what you're gonna say when you're 35, all right?

490
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,180
 And you got scars and your lungs are nasty,

491
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,540
 you go, I should've known that

492
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,040
 because somebody told you the answer to the riddle.

493
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,560
 It seems so obvious, doesn't it?

494
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,700
 Once you know the answer to a riddle,

495
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,740
 that's why you murmur, it seems so stinking obvious.

496
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,660
 Like, look, man, all of us,

497
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,060
 you ever watch that spelling bee?

498
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,820
 Those kids that get those words right

499
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,660
 and they know all the word words

500
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,780
 and all that different stuff?

501
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,020
 I mean, there's one, somebody asked me this one time

502
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,140
 at a stump, they go, hey, what word, I guarantee you,

503
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,580
 what word in the English language

504
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,460
 is always spelled incorrectly?

505
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,200
 Incorrectly, that's exactly right, all right?

506
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,060
 It's always spelled that way, every time,

507
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,420
 even those kids in the spelling bee,

508
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,720
 they spell it incorrectly.

509
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,940
 I love riddles, all right?

510
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,560
 Let me tell you something, life is a riddle.

511
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,660
 And until somebody, until somebody gives you the answer, man,

512
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,180
 it's gonna mess with you and jack you up.

513
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,680
 Now, I want you to watch where Proverbs goes next.

514
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,380
 Because the way you answer this one question,

515
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,620
 like, why are you here, where are you from?

516
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,900
 Who created you, is there a creator, is he good?

517
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,660
 How do I get the most out of life?

518
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,320
 Where is life really?

519
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,600
 How you answer that question

520
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,500
 is the most important thing about you.

521
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,260
 Look what Proverbs 1 goes on to say.

522
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,460
 Man, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

523
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,260
 That's even a riddle because you think, man, fear,

524
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,580
 I don't wanna be scared of it, no, listen,

525
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,420
 here's what I'm gonna tell you,

526
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,160
 I do my job in the next few minutes.

527
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,620
 You'll have a proper fear of the Lord.

528
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,340
 And what I mean by that is you'll respect him,

529
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,980
 you'll know him for who he is,

530
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,020
 and you'll be somebody that goes,

531
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,380
 I don't wanna miss another word

532
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,040
 that comes out of his mouth.

533
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,500
 If it is true that he is a sun and a shield,

534
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,200
 that he gives life and light, okay?

535
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,180
 Everybody else is just saying,

536
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,280
 hey, we're trying to be brighter than the sun.

537
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,340
 That's what people have always done.

538
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,260
 I don't need God, I'll be my own God.

539
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,520
 God is a sun and a shield.

540
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,780
 He is a provider of life.

541
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,460
 He causes things to grow, he gives light and direction,

542
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,860
 and he is a protector.

543
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,860
 He gives, watch this, grace and glory.

544
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,300
 When you think about God, this is Psalm 84, 11.

545
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,980
 When you think about God, what do you think of?

546
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,100
 If you don't think about God as a gift giver,

547
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,900
 that he gives you stuff you don't deserve, that's grace.

548
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,900
 And he gives you, watch this, glory, not momentary beauty.

549
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,540
 That youth promises will please you forever.

550
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,840
 No, it fades.

551
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,540
 God gives you glory.

552
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,980
 I tell my little girls, man, you pursue true beauty.

553
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,660
 Bodies deteriorate, persons develop.

554
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,200
 God wants to make you glorious and beautiful

555
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,500
 so that others look at you, not just in your 20s,

556
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,780
 in your best times.

557
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,940
 He wants people to look at you for decades

558
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:01,340
 and just go, that is a life, that is a man.

559
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,080
 If we multiply that kind of human,

560
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,480
 this would be a better place.

561
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,720
 Not if I could get that human to do what I wanna do

562
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
 for a second, it would give me pleasure.

563
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,920
 But God just says, hey man, I wanna give you life.

564
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,440
 I want you to be a life giver to others.

565
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,560
 I don't want you to seek pleasure from other people.

566
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,000
 I want you to find the pleasure that is in me.

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
 And you are, when you become convinced

568
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,880
 that that's who God is, that he's not looking

569
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,800
 to rip you off, but looking to set you free,

570
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,620
 you're gonna be like this every time he speaks.

571
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,460
 Tell me more of God.

572
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,280
 What's he give?

573
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,260
 He's given more grace, more glory.

574
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,380
 I want more of that.

575
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,980
 Watch this, the next verse in Psalm 84 says this.

576
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,980
 No good thing does he withhold from those who love him.

577
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,900
 What's the bad advice tonight?

578
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
 The bad advice tonight is get it while you can.

579
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,560
 Treat yourself, go get what the world has to offer.

580
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,780
 I'm telling you, the world is lying to you.

581
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,340
 The song's always been sung.

582
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,060
 From Homer's time to my time in the '70s

583
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,460
 to your time in the teens.

584
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,080
 And there's always been a loving father

585
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,140
 who wants to say this to you.

586
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,180
 Watch this.

587
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,580
 Hear my son, my daughter, your father's instruction.

588
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,960
 This is verse eight.

589
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,860
 Do not forsake your mother's teaching.

590
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,520
 Indeed, there are graceful, watch this,

591
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,140
 a graceful wreath to your head

592
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,060
 and ornaments about your neck, my son,

593
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,080
 if sinners entice you, and they will.

594
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,940
 Their songs are everywhere.

595
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,520
 Do not consent.

596
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,100
 Now watch this.

597
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,920
 Tell me, see if your father in heaven

598
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,060
 understands the siren songs you hear.

599
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,600
 I hear 'em all the time.

600
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,860
 If they say, come with us, let us lie and wait for blood,

601
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,700
 let us ambush the innocent without cause,

602
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
 let us swaddle them alive like sheol,

603
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,340
 even whole as those who grab 'em at the pit,

604
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,140
 we will find all kinds of precious wealth.

605
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,820
 We will fill our houses with spoil.

606
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,900
 Throw in your lot with us.

607
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,220
 We shall all have one purse.

608
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,460
 (laughing)

609
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,540
 Right?

610
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,000
 Just, whenever I read that, I read it

611
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,520
 with that kind of build, and it's like I see a pirate.

612
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,360
 He's like, let's go rape the women.

613
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,120
 Let's go get the booty, right?

614
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,960
 Pirate's booty.

615
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
 And let's, you know, let's go.

616
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,320
 And I read that, I'm like, yeah, man,

617
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,260
 that looks like the ship to sail with.

618
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,480
 Those guys don't have to really work.

619
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,440
 Everybody thinks they're cool.

620
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,520
 They make movies about 'em.

621
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,000
 Everybody wants to be Johnny Depp.

622
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,760
 And you're like, gosh, you know, should I go?

623
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,860
 Right, every time I read that, I get that.

624
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,640
 Let me just, just for a second,

625
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,360
 let me just take you over and leave this metaphor

626
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,900
 for a second, let me show you an amazing section

627
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,280
 of scripture here in Proverbs chapter seven.

628
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,360
 Watch, this one's a little bit more seductive.

629
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,880
 It uses seductive language.

630
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,960
 I mean, you read this, you're almost like,

631
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,820
 gosh, I'm not even sure I should read this.

632
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,760
 First of all, we'll set it up.

633
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,640
 Proverbs seven, verses one through four.

634
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,600
 My son, keep my words.

635
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,000
 Think of a pleading father who loves you,

636
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,480
 who's not trying to rip you off.

637
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,700
 He's trying to keep you from that disease,

638
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,360
 from that being used for a moment and discarded.

639
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,440
 Treasure what I'm saying to you.

640
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,360
 Keep my commandments and live.

641
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,280
 And my teaching is the apple of your eye

642
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,260
 at the center of your thought.

643
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,280
 Bind them on your fingers.

644
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,060
 Write them on the tablet of your heart.

645
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,360
 Say to wisdom, you are my sister,

646
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,840
 and call understanding your intimate friend.

647
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
 Why, watch this.

648
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,360
 That wisdom and understanding will keep you

649
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,760
 from an adulteress, from that beautiful,

650
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,420
 dark-skinned woman who flatters with her words.

651
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,320
 For at the window of my house,

652
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,520
 I looked out through my lattice.

653
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,480
 I see it happen every day.

654
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,440
 I saw among the naive and discerned among the youths

655
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,560
 a young man lacking sense.

656
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,160
 Passing through the street near her corner,

657
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,880
 he takes the way to her house.

658
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,520
 In the twilight, in the evening, it's getting dark.

659
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
 He can move in the shadows, in the middle of the night,

660
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
 in the darkness, behold, here she comes,

661
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,800
 a woman comes to meet him, dressed as a harlot,

662
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,420
 beautiful, silky, cunning of heart.

663
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,080
 She is boisterous, rebellious, seductive.

664
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,020
 Her feet do not remain at home.

665
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,640
 She is now in the streets, now in the square.

666
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,920
 She lurks by every corner.

667
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,040
 She seizes him and kisses him.

668
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,920
 With a brazen face, she says to him,

669
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,520
 I was due to offer peace offerings today.

670
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,840
 That was my excuse to get out.

671
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,140
 Today I have paid my peace vows.

672
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,480
 Therefore, I've come out to meet you,

673
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,960
 to seek your presence earnestly.

674
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,800
 I love you.

675
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,620
 You're what I need.

676
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,560
 You can make me happy.

677
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,480
 I have found you.

678
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,720
 I have spread my couch with coverings,

679
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,240
 with colored linens of Egypt.

680
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,120
 I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

681
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,680
 This is kind of like, you know,

682
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,880
 Proverbs 7 porn is what this is.

683
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,000
 I'm not kidding.

684
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,880
 And you watch this, here it goes.

685
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,960
 Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning.

686
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,720
 Let us delight ourselves with caresses,

687
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,040
 for my husband is not home.

688
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,360
 He has gone on a long journey.

689
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,520
 He has taken a bag of money with him.

690
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,240
 At full moon, he will come home

691
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,680
 with her many persuasions, I guess.

692
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,960
 She entices him.

693
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,280
 Come, get it now.

694
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,380
 With her flattering lips, she seduces him.

695
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,540
 See, this is where most of us just kind of go

696
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,820
 to a blackout phase.

697
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,160
 And we get lost in the fantasy

698
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,720
 of how amazing it would be to be pursued

699
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,360
 by that beautiful woman.

700
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,920
 We've imagined her time after time.

701
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,560
 Each time we do, we have chemicals that fire in our brain

702
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,120
 that hardwire us to want her more.

703
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,320
 We put these images before us and we fantasize

704
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,400
 until finally we go out and we numb ourselves

705
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,720
 and drink so that we can be a little bit less discerning

706
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,400
 so that we can move towards her,

707
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,340
 maybe in that bar and be as high as an empire building.

708
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,000
 And then maybe we can just have a little bit of that light

709
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
 when God all the time is saying, I am your son.

710
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,520
 I am your shield.

711
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,720
 Listen to me, watch this.

712
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
 Look at what happens 'cause I wanna wake you up.

713
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,960
 'Cause the story's not over when she arches her back.

714
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,040
 This is the truth.

715
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,520
 Suddenly he follows her.

716
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,800
 As an ox goes to the slaughter or as one in fetters

717
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,360
 to the discipline of a fool.

718
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,500
 Until an arrow pierces through his liver, that is fatal.

719
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,480
 As a bird hastens to the snare,

720
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
 what kind of bird does that?

721
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,040
 So he does not know that it will cost him his life.

722
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,320
 Now therefore my son, listen to me.

723
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,960
 Come up out of your little pornographic imaging

724
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,080
 about how pleasant it will be.

725
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,940
 Pay attention to the words of my mouth.

726
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,480
 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways.

727
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,280
 Don't stray into her paths for many are the victims

728
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,920
 she has cast down and numerous all her slain.

729
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,040
 Her house is the way to hell.

730
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,720
 Descending to the chambers of death.

731
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,640
 Another proverb early on says,

732
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,400
 you will be reduced to a loaf of bread.

733
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,540
 He goes, he does not know that the dead are there.

734
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,800
 But she is seductive.

735
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,720
 Come treat yourself.

736
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,160
 Back to Proverbs one of the pirates, look at this.

737
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:09,520
 Verse 15, my son, little interlude,

738
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,120
 do not walk in the way with him.

739
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,640
 Keep your feet from their path.

740
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,400
 For their feet run to evil, they hasten to shed blood.

741
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,560
 Indeed, it's useless to spread the bait of net

742
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,400
 in the sight of a bird.

743
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,440
 Birds have more sense.

744
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,800
 Bird brains, small brains have the sense

745
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,040
 to not go near a net.

746
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,000
 People who go there, they lie in wait,

747
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,960
 who live like this, they lie in wait for their own blood.

748
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,360
 They ambush their own lives.

749
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,400
 They're ruining their own lives.

750
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
 I know it looks like they're having fun.

751
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
 I know the commercials say they're having fun.

752
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,780
 I know it looks like Vegas is having fun.

753
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,400
 But the dead are there.

754
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:49,020
 So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence.

755
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,720
 It takes away the life of its possessors.

756
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,360
 That's just a dad trying to, you know what the son said?

757
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,320
 Not dad, not me, it won't take my life.

758
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,120
 Let me just show you some pictures of some of your friends

759
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,080
 maybe that are out there.

760
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,240
 And this is one that had a big night on the town

761
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
 and it didn't go exactly like they wanted, okay?

762
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,840
 'Cause they were busted, they were popped, okay?

763
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
 They went out there, they were bumming the folks.

764
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,760
 They said, "Come on, man, play with me."

765
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,000
 And okay, there were some of the unlucky ones

766
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,120
 that had a little bit too much.

767
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,520
 They didn't have a designated driver.

768
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,480
 So they got arrested.

769
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,080
 So there's a little smirk, I'm 18, yeah, you got me.

770
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,920
 All right, so tonight I'm a perp,

771
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,780
 but I'm gonna party again.

772
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,160
 Let's keep reading.

773
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,560
 Verse 20, wisdom shouts in the streets.

774
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,140
 She lifts her voice in the square.

775
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,280
 At the head of the noisy street, she cries out, man.

776
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,240
 Or at the porch on Tuesday nights, she cries out.

777
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,740
 And at the entrance of the city gates,

778
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,620
 she utters her sayings.

779
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,360
 How long, oh, naive ones, will you love being simple-minded

780
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,880
 and scoffers delight themselves in scoffing

781
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
 and fools hate knowledge?

782
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,660
 Turn to my reproof.

783
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,860
 This is what we're doing here tonight.

784
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,560
 Turn to the reproof.

785
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,160
 Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.

786
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,320
 I'm not mad at you, sweetie.

787
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,620
 I'm not mad at you, son.

788
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,460
 I just don't want you to give yourself to the harlot

789
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,340
 'cause I know where that will lead.

790
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,160
 Come, and by the way, expand this.

791
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,600
 Expand this well beyond just physical intimacy

792
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,520
 with somebody who's not your spouse.

793
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,680
 This is any air, it is any voice that says,

794
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,380
 God doesn't have your best interests in mind.

795
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,680
 Come on, man, you don't need that old-time religion.

796
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,340
 No, you don't need old-time religion.

797
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,960
 You need the ancient of days who is a loving father

798
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,400
 who wants to make all your ways peace,

799
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,720
 who wants to train you up in godliness

800
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,020
 so that guilt and shame and sorrow

801
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,420
 will not define your life.

802
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,420
 He wants to be a blessing to you.

803
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,960
 It's who God is.

804
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,940
 He's kind.

805
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,860
 Listen to what it says.

806
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,900
 How long will you love being simple-minded

807
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,740
 and scoffers delight?

808
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,560
 Turn to my reproof.

809
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,500
 I'll pour out my spirit on you.

810
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,220
 Verse 24, because I called, watch this,

811
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,980
 and you refused, because I stretched out my hand

812
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,820
 and no one paid attention

813
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,100
 because you kept sowing,

814
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
 and because you didn't reap,

815
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,400
 the hearts of men among you were given fully to do evil.

816
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,340
 This is what it says.

817
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,720
 You neglected all my counsel.

818
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,560
 You didn't want my reproof.

819
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,680
 Listen, this is Proverbs 1.

820
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,900
 This is God just telling you.

821
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,740
 This is the way it's gonna be.

822
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,680
 I'm not mad at you.

823
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,040
 You're free to make your own choices,

824
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,920
 but you're not free to choose your consequences.

825
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,120
 This is the law of the harvest.

826
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,420
 You reap what you sow.

827
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,840
 You reap more than you sowed,

828
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,560
 and you reap it later than you sowed it.

829
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,660
 There's a reason that you put that seed of evil

830
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,960
 in your life, and right away, it doesn't grow poison

831
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,680
 because it takes a while for it to germinate and die.

832
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,200
 And then eventually, it gets roots,

833
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,440
 and then it bursts up through the soil,

834
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,080
 and all of a sudden, it overtakes your house,

835
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,460
 and you're living underneath its shade,

836
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,180
 and it's feeding you things that are bitter.

837
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,400
 It takes time.

838
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,560
 You put one seed in the ground,

839
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,260
 it grows a whole plant of trouble.

840
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,520
 And God's just saying, listen,

841
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,780
 I tried to spare you from that.

842
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,620
 Watch this.

843
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,720
 You neglected my counsel, verse 25.

844
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,080
 You didn't want my reproof.

845
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,000
 Now, this is wisdom talking, not God.

846
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,260
 I will laugh at your calamity.

847
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,420
 I will mock at you when your dread comes.

848
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,740
 When your dread comes like a storm,

849
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,300
 and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,

850
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,100
 when distress and anguish come upon you, and they will.

851
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,100
 Then you will finally call on me on wisdom,

852
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,940
 but I will not answer.

853
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,500
 They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.

854
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,860
 You're gonna be trapped.

855
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,620
 Watch this, because they hated knowledge,

856
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,940
 because they bought the lie, they took the bad advice.

857
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,100
 This is recess.

858
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,860
 I can grow up later.

859
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,900
 Because they hated knowledge, they did not choose

860
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,620
 to listen tenderly to a loving Father

861
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,620
 who wanted to protect them.

862
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,700
 They would not accept my counsel.

863
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,660
 They spurned all my reproof.

864
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,500
 Watch this.

865
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,020
 So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way,

866
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,780
 and be satiated with their own devices.

867
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,580
 For the waywardness of the naive will kill them,

868
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,660
 and the complacencies of fools will destroy them.

869
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,400
 Do you see that, guys?

870
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,800
 You gotta begin with the end in mind.

871
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,780
 It is a habit of highly successful people.

872
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
 It's habit number one.

873
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,220
 You gotta begin with the end in mind.

874
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,060
 And you know what youth do?

875
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,540
 The youth go, I'll worry about the end later.

876
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,520
 That is why it says, by the same author in another book,

877
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,340
 it is better to go to the house of mourning,

878
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,920
 Ecclesiastes 7, 2, than it is to the house of feasting.

879
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,160
 Because that is the end of every man,

880
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,900
 and the living take it to heart.

881
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,180
 It's why it says in verse four,

882
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,340
 the mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,

883
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,940
 while the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure.

884
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,980
 It's better to listen to the rebuke of a wise man

885
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,260
 than for one to listen to the song of fools.

886
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:38,180
 So you get to decide, man.

887
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,980
 You get to decide what the ingredients are

888
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,860
 that you put into the mixing bowl of your life.

889
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,940
 And God's not mad at you.

890
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,900
 Here's the thing, wisdom will mock you,

891
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,700
 but your heavenly Father is right here tonight.

892
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,300
 He's just saying, just stop, just stop.

893
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,720
 I am a God who makes all things new,

894
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,180
 but you've gotta stop throwing those things

895
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,220
 into the bowl of your life

896
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,260
 and wondering why you're miserable.

897
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,780
 You gotta stop asking me why the cake

898
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,560
 of your existence tastes this way.

899
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,340
 You gotta quit saying to me, why did I do this to you?

900
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,560
 I didn't do this to you.

901
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,520
 I gave you a recipe card

902
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,820
 that was gonna make life pleasant.

903
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,300
 This is Proverbs 22, four.

904
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,000
 Proverbs 22, four, one of the most amazing proverbs

905
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,440
 in all of the scripture, the reward of humility

906
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,400
 and the fear of the Lord are, watch,

907
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,400
 riches, honor, and life.

908
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
 See, what's the enemy told you, man?

909
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,720
 There's no life over there.

910
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,100
 You gotta listen.

911
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,400
 It's just the opposite.

912
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,640
 You know what some bad advice is?

913
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,540
 Go get you some.

914
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,600
 You know what some great advice is?

915
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,900
 Go get all of God's you can while you're young.

916
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,820
 Get him now while you still can enjoy.

917
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,200
 Oh, remember our friends that were trying

918
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,040
 to get us to go party?

919
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,640
 I know they got rung up and busted.

920
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,520
 Okay, they got out of jail.

921
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,560
 They went out and they partied some more.

922
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,920
 Well, the second time they got arrested,

923
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,720
 this is what one of 'em looked like.

924
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,000
 It goes on from there.

925
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,800
 Another one of our buddies, she got arrested again

926
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,820
 or he got arrested again.

927
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,120
 This is the second time he got busted.

928
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
 He was a three-time loser.

929
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,680
 This is what he looks like now.

930
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,120
 Oh yeah, there was another friend.

931
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,960
 We had a bunch of 'em.

932
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
 That was her and now she's that.

933
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
 She's probably out there tricking

934
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,120
 to get some of what she needs.

935
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,600
 Our sweet friend at 32, 37, now 38 was a rough year.

936
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,440
 Then we had this dear friend.

937
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,340
 Life got harder and harder for her.

938
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,140
 Wisdom mocked her.

939
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,580
 And then there's one more.

940
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,740
 This sweet thing.

941
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,140
 Between the first arrest and second arrest,

942
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,820
 was freebasing, got a little burned up,

943
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,620
 but that didn't stop her 'cause she was addicted

944
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,580
 and the synapses were there and she had to go back

945
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,700
 and got busted again after she experienced

946
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,000
 the horrors of going her way.

947
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,820
 Listen, you guys gotta begin with the end in mind.

948
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,420
 I'm just telling you.

949
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,660
 What you do is you always study the stories

950
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,980
 that are the exception to the rule.

951
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,540
 But you know why they're an exception to the rule?

952
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,740
 Because there is a rule.

953
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,260
 And there's a father up there who's just saying,

954
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,060
 look, I love you enough to tell you.

955
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:05,320
 I don't want your destiny to be guilt and shame.

956
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,940
 I want it to be riches, honor, and life.

957
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,020
 And the sooner you can get to it,

958
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,660
 the better it's gonna be for you.

959
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:16,900
 This is what the guy who wrote that book

960
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,380
 said at the very end of his life.

961
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,380
 And it's one of my favorite places to go.

962
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,300
 We already read in Ecclesiastes.

963
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,540
 I'm gonna go down to chapter 12.

964
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,940
 But Ecclesiastes chapter seven says,

965
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,820
 "It's better to go to the house of mourning

966
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
 "than the house of feasting

967
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,100
 "'cause it's the end of every man."

968
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,420
 I'm telling you guys, you oughta go

969
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,260
 and you oughta listen to people

970
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,500
 when they talk about what life was about.

971
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,780
 When lives come to an end, you wanna sit and go,

972
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,140
 what do I want my life to have been?

973
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,520
 Man, that guy was a party.

974
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,340
 Or do you want it to be that person

975
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,700
 was a source of good to me?

976
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,300
 And they kept me from destruction and sorrow.

977
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,740
 They were kind to me and they modeled for me a better way.

978
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,140
 They showed me that there was a better song to listen to.

979
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,540
 They, when everybody else was singing the songs of fool,

980
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,060
 they lived a life of faith.

981
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,300
 And I saw the blessing in this person's life.

982
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:13,100
 Do you know what the whole book of Ecclesiastes is about?

983
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,540
 The entire thing is about a guy trying to find life

984
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,040
 everywhere that he can.

985
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,620
 And at the end of his life, when he's tried everything,

986
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,780
 and the way I can describe the book of Ecclesiastes

987
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,340
 is this way, Solomon was the only guy

988
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,420
 that ran out of mirages before he ran out of money.

989
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,240
 What do I mean?

990
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,840
 Mirages are appearances that there's life somewhere

991
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,940
 because of a hallucination,

992
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,340
 because of the way light will play with you

993
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,040
 in certain heated environments

994
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,340
 where you think that there's gonna be

995
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,020
 some source of life up here.

996
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
 And the closer you get to it,

997
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,340
 you realize it was a mirage, it's not really there.

998
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,340
 Solomon chased wine, women, song, power, fame, position.

999
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
 He got it all, and after he chased

1000
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,060
 every single mirage there was,

1001
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,760
 he still had everything he needed.

1002
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,540
 He ran the experiment for you.

1003
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,620
 He lived it, and now he's gonna say,

1004
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,580
 I've been going everywhere to try and find life.

1005
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,420
 I'm going back at the end of my life

1006
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,180
 where I was when I started at the beginning

1007
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,700
 when my father told me that the Lord God

1008
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,700
 is a sun and shield.

1009
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,380
 This is the very end of his life.

1010
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,860
 This is the last words of a dying man.

1011
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,940
 This is the house of mourning.

1012
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,460
 This is what he says, are you ready?

1013
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,140
 Let's tune in.

1014
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,480
 He says, "Remember the Creator," watch this,

1015
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,580
 "in the days of your youth."

1016
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:30,640
 It's not have recess, because recess is no fun

1017
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,420
 when you don't live the way you should live.

1018
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,740
 You come back with scars and scabs and sorrow,

1019
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,660
 and you live with bullies,

1020
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,180
 and you're isolated and you're alone.

1021
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,140
 He's saying life is right here with your teacher

1022
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,280
 and your master and your God.

1023
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,140
 He's a good God.

1024
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,420
 "Use the days of your youth before the evil days come

1025
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,960
 "and the years draw near when you will say,

1026
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,140
 "I have no delight in them."

1027
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,020
 This is the truth.

1028
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,620
 I'm gonna just tell you, there's all kinds of people

1029
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,340
 that are gonna have recess, recess, recess,

1030
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,980
 divorce, affair, addiction,

1031
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,900
 and they're gonna make it through,

1032
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,420
 and late in their life, they're gonna come to a moment

1033
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,700
 where they go, this was crazy,

1034
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,260
 and someone's gonna talk about the grace of God

1035
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,560
 and they're gonna take it.

1036
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,640
 And I believe if they genuinely take it,

1037
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,700
 I think they'll be saved.

1038
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,900
 I think much of their life will be wasted.

1039
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,480
 But here's what you need to know.

1040
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,560
 You have no idea how many of us in this room

1041
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,200
 are gonna make it to be three score or more.

1042
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,320
 God offers forgiveness to your repentance.

1043
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,680
 He does not promise tomorrow to your procrastination.

1044
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,720
 I today stood next to a hole

1045
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,580
 that I put a 17-year-old in today.

1046
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:44,920
 And I have no idea where your hole is gonna come,

1047
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,640
 but it doesn't matter about where your hole's gonna come.

1048
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,840
 You gotta decide when are you gonna grab life.

1049
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,520
 When are you gonna want what God wants for you?

1050
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,920
 He's not trying to rip you off.

1051
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,320
 He's trying to set you free.

1052
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,920
 I'm gonna tell you, by the grace of God,

1053
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
 I am one of those strange people

1054
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,120
 that when only the good die young was on,

1055
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,880
 somebody said, let me just tell you, that's a lie.

1056
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,520
 The good don't die young.

1057
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,120
 People who die to themselves experience life.

1058
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,760
 And I started to listen.

1059
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,320
 And so from about 1979 on, man,

1060
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,600
 I have been testing this book to see if it is true.

1061
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,960
 And I'm here to tell you,

1062
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,120
 some 40 years later almost,

1063
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
 that there has never been a time

1064
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,960
 when I have listened to a loving father

1065
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,360
 who is a son in shield, who gives grace and glory,

1066
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,040
 who no good thing does he deny those who love him.

1067
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,840
 There's not been a single time I've listened to him

1068
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
 that I've regretted it.

1069
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,640
 I've missed out on some incredible enticing opportunities.

1070
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,760
 I have missed out on the seductive words of foreign women.

1071
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,120
 I've been in those environments.

1072
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,320
 I have missed out on numbing myself in the face of pain.

1073
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,160
 But you know what else I've done?

1074
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,160
 I've grown to be a man.

1075
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,560
 Do you know what happens, by the way,

1076
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,640
 if you learn to numb your pain with meds

1077
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,560
 or with alcohol?

1078
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,520
 Here's what happens.

1079
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,560
 You don't grow.

1080
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,120
 You don't become the full measure of a person you should be.

1081
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,400
 You stunt your maturity because instead of growing up

1082
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,960
 and persevering and becoming the man

1083
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,920
 that God intended to be, you stay stuck as a 17-year-old.

1084
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,640
 You stay stuck as a 22-year-old,

1085
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,920
 and you never grow through it

1086
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,520
 because every time there's pain,

1087
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,360
 you run and put the pacifier of medication in your life.

1088
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,600
 And that is why you see so many immature 30-year-olds

1089
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,360
 and 40-year-olds because they never grew

1090
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,120
 beyond the moment they became addicted.

1091
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,000
 Every time I feel sad, every time I feel lonely,

1092
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
 every time I feel isolated,

1093
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,200
 I go and I just click on that button.

1094
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,080
 I watch a movie and I imagine I'm in there.

1095
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,680
 Instead of learning to be a man,

1096
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,960
 I just keep laying down pathways

1097
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,880
 to what I think is pleasure, but it's not real pleasure.

1098
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,960
 You stunt your growth and you stunt your development

1099
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,840
 and you never grow to be the glorious person

1100
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,000
 that God wants you to be.

1101
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,720
 Don't go intoxicate yourself.

1102
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,360
 That's what the scripture says.

1103
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,760
 It says don't be drunk with wine for that is dissipation.

1104
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,800
 It stunts your growth.

1105
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,360
 It makes you less than the man or woman

1106
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,640
 you're supposed to be,

1107
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,440
 but instead be filled with the Spirit.

1108
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,560
 And when you're filled with the Spirit,

1109
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,040
 what's gonna happen is there's gonna be more love

1110
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,320
 and goodness and gentleness and kindness

1111
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,240
 and faithfulness and self-control.

1112
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,720
 There's gonna be a measure of a man and a godly woman

1113
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,560
 that people are gonna look at and go,

1114
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,480
 "Who are you?

1115
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,600
 "Who's your daddy?"

1116
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,200
 And you get to say, "By the grace of God."

1117
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,880
 I gotta tell ya, by the grace of God,

1118
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,520
 it's the kindness of God.

1119
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,120
 And I still have a hard time listening to my dad,

1120
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,080
 but he has forgiven me and I'm learning to fear him.

1121
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,320
 And what you're seeing in me that is beautiful

1122
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,920
 is 'cause I've been tutored underneath his kindness.

1123
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,600
 (congregation murmurs)

1124
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,840
 Look, guys.

1125
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,680
 Look what it says.

1126
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,520
 This is Psalm.

1127
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,360
 Let's just read it real quickly and we're done.

1128
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,200
 He just says this.

1129
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,680
 He goes, "Draw near to God."

1130
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,800
 God is the God of the young.

1131
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,280
 Can I just say this to you real quick?

1132
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,680
 Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

1133
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,080
 And then it goes on through and it talks.

1134
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,760
 Everybody thinks it's a great psalm to read

1135
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,680
 next to people who are on their deathbed.

1136
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:00,120
 Psalm 23 is not written for old men on their deathbed.

1137
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,960
 It is written for young shepherd boys

1138
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,280
 who are facing bears and lions and giants.

1139
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,680
 Psalm 23 is a psalm of a 20-year-old.

1140
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,520
 And you gotta figure out, man,

1141
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,840
 God is here to shepherd me through this time

1142
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,640
 when all my insecurities and all my wonders

1143
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,160
 and all my hormones are just firing

1144
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,080
 and all my opportunities before me.

1145
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,560
 And instead of wastering it

1146
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,320
 and squandering it on loose living,

1147
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,920
 Psalm 23 is saying, "Come here, man.

1148
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,200
 I'm gonna walk you through the valley of the shadow of death

1149
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,240
 when everybody else goes to play

1150
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,040
 and they train themselves to die,

1151
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,640
 I'm gonna train you to be a great daddy, a great mama.

1152
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,240
 I'm gonna train you to have a successful marriage.

1153
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,400
 I'm gonna train you how to be a glory to God

1154
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
 and to your community.

1155
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,920
 I'm gonna train you how to be a selfless leader, a warrior."

1156
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,840
 That's Psalm 23.

1157
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,880
 And God is calling you in.

1158
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,240
 It's not there to read when you're on your deathbed.

1159
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,760
 It's there to read when you are starting your life.

1160
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,320
 And Solomon wants you to know it.

1161
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,160
 He says this, "Don't wait till you're dead.

1162
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,360
 Don't wait till you're weak

1163
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,840
 before the sun and the light,

1164
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,080
 the moon and the stars are dark."

1165
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,640
 And what he's saying, "Before there's diminished light

1166
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,440
 and hope and there's no hope for tomorrow

1167
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,080
 and the clouds return after the rain."

1168
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,960
 In other words, you're increasingly gloomy

1169
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,360
 because you realize life is about to be over.

1170
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,160
 "Don't wait to meet God then.

1171
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
 He's a God of the young.

1172
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,360
 In the day that the watchmen of the house tremble."

1173
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,480
 That's the arms and the hands.

1174
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,840
 They kind of watch the house like this

1175
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,280
 and they're weak and you're old and you tremble.

1176
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,800
 "Don't wait till the mighty men stoop."

1177
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,240
 That's, these are the mighty men.

1178
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,120
 That's what he's talking about right here.

1179
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,200
 "Don't wait till they're weak.

1180
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,400
 The grinding ones stand idle."

1181
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,280
 Because there are a few, he was talking about,

1182
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,080
 you know, he was talking about your teeth.

1183
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,960
 There's not many of them.

1184
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,800
 By the way, you want a riddle?

1185
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,640
 I'll throw out a riddle for you.

1186
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,680
 How do you know that the toothbrush

1187
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,000
 was invented in Kentucky?

1188
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,880
 Because if it was invented anywhere else,

1189
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,080
 it'd be called the teeth brush.

1190
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,000
 That's why, all right?

1191
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,840
 No, okay.

1192
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,680
 All right, back to here.

1193
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,400
 All right, no, come on.

1194
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,440
 If this is broadcast to Kentucky,

1195
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,120
 just pretend I said Arkansas and here we go.

1196
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,960
 All right, here we go.

1197
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,320
 Come on, watch.

1198
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,760
 Solomon's saying, "Don't wait till you lose your teeth."

1199
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,080
 All right?

1200
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,200
 Watch.

1201
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
 He goes on to say,

1202
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,360
 "When those who look through the windows grow dim,"

1203
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,000
 he's talking about your eyes in a very poetic way,

1204
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,040
 "and the doors in the street are shut."

1205
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,200
 That's the street of light.

1206
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,240
 The lips are shut because you're like this.

1207
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,520
 "And the grinding mill is low.

1208
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,360
 Your appetite is going away and no one will arise.

1209
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,280
 And one will arise at the sound of the bird.

1210
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,600
 Early in the morning, sleep is fleeting.

1211
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,080
 The daughters of the song will sing softly.

1212
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,600
 You can't hear anything.

1213
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,800
 Furthermore, at that point in life,

1214
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,360
 men are afraid of high places.

1215
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,680
 You have a loss of vigor and tears in the road.

1216
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,480
 The almond tree blossoms, your hair gets white.

1217
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,280
 The grasshopper drags himself along.

1218
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,440
 The back is hunched over.

1219
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,320
 The caper berry is ineffective."

1220
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,640
 Viagra.

1221
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,720
 "For a man goes to eternal home

1222
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,600
 while mourners go to the street.

1223
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,680
 Remember before the silver cord is broken,

1224
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,920
 the cord of life, the spinal cord,

1225
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,520
 the golden bowl is crushed.

1226
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,920
 The pitcher by the well is shattered.

1227
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,760
 The wheel of the cistern, the heart,

1228
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,320
 is not moving like it should.

1229
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,480
 And the dust will return to the earth as it was

1230
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
 and the spirit will return to God who gave it."

1231
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,120
 Oh, vanity.

1232
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,880
 How foolish to live your life apart from a God

1233
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,840
 who wants you to have lived those last 60 years

1234
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,800
 that now as you're sitting there scared,

1235
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,720
 he wants those 60 years to look back on them

1236
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,960
 and go, "Man, I was useful.

1237
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,880
 I was loving.

1238
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,960
 I was chased.

1239
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,040
 I was powerful.

1240
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,000
 I wasn't a victim to dogs and liars.

1241
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 I tied myself to the master truth

1242
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,040
 and I did not wreck my ship

1243
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,760
 and everybody that was on it with me."

1244
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,880
 Don't you want that life?

1245
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,680
 Then quit listening to the bad advice to treat yourself.

1246
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,520
 And you learn to come after the one who loves you.

1247
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,240
 Folks, that's some good advice.

1248
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,520
 I'm here to tell you, I haven't done it perfectly,

1249
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,520
 but every time I've done it, every time I've done it,

1250
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,600
 it's been a blessing.

1251
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
 I say it almost every time I'm here.

1252
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,280
 First John 5:3, "This is the love of God

1253
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,400
 that we keep his commandments

1254
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,600
 and his commandments are not burdensome."

1255
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,040
 Hey guys, I'm gonna tell you,

1256
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,720
 man, there's always a backlash out there.

1257
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,280
 There's always a moment you wake up

1258
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,160
 and you sober up and you look over and you go,

1259
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,000
 "Oh my gosh."

1260
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,440
 There's always an unwanted something you're dealing with.

1261
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,800
 When you walk with God,

1262
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,720
 all your ways are peace.

1263
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,120
 It doesn't mean that it's not gonna be trouble,

1264
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,360
 but he's gonna say, "Listen,

1265
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,880
 you're gonna have peace in the midst of trouble

1266
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,680
 because you understand why there's trouble in the world,

1267
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,960
 because people don't tie themselves to the mast of truth.

1268
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,320
 And you're gonna run into some of them

1269
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,880
 and they're gonna be cruel to you and mean to you.

1270
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,160
 I'm gonna tell you not to yoke with them.

1271
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,360
 I'm gonna tell them not to make them your companions,

1272
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,440
 but be a friend to them.

1273
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,720
 Friends love at all times.

1274
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,040
 Friend, treat them as individuals, not as projects.

1275
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,120
 And friends, speak the truth.

1276
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,720
 You be a friend to those people,

1277
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,640
 but you let me be your companion."

1278
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,920
 So you want some good advice?

1279
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,320
 Get God while you can, not it.

1280
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:03,680
 Not some impersonal pronoun that wants to waste you on it.

1281
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,400
 You get the lover who gives grace and glory.

1282
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,000
 You get God while you can,

1283
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,880
 wherever you can and you get all you can.

1284
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,680
 You'll never be sated.

1285
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,760
 You'll never loathe him.

1286
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,400
 You'll learn to love him more and more.

1287
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,200
 The beauty of walking with God is the longer you do it,

1288
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,280
 the more you see the sweetness of his way.

1289
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,920
 Some of you guys are seeing the bitterness of the other way.

1290
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,000
 That's because you're serving a liar.

1291
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,600
 And you're not gonna find anybody in this room

1292
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,880
 that's been walking along with God

1293
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,480
 that go, "He gets more and more bitter."

1294
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,120
 They're gonna go, "He gets more and more sweet."

1295
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,040
 And my life gets more and more

1296
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,480
 full of riches and honor in life.

1297
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,080
 And I'm ready for this life to end

1298
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,680
 because it'll get sweeter still,

1299
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,120
 where the rest of you are hoping you can hang on

1300
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,000
 and that this bitterness that you're in,

1301
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,400
 that this hell on earth will continue

1302
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,160
 because if you're not walking with God,

1303
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,000
 you need to know something.

1304
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,120
 This is your heaven.

1305
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,920
 So you get all the glory and fun and intoxication you can

1306
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,800
 'cause it's never going to get better than this.

1307
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,360
 If you know God and you're walking with him

1308
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,800
 on this earth that isn't as it should be,

1309
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,680
 this is your hell.

1310
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,440
 It's only gonna get better.

1311
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,760
 And while it's here, it's gonna get better

1312
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,280
 'cause he's gonna give you purpose and meaning in life.

1313
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,480
 Do you want some of that?

1314
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,200
 Get all the God you can, wherever you can,

1315
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,680
 as much as you can.

1316
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,880
 That's some good advice.

1317
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,720
 Father, I pray for my friends that they believe it,

1318
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,280
 that they know it, they'd see this true.

1319
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,440
 And Lord, I am sure there's some people in this room

1320
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,640
 that right now are hearing from an enemy

1321
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,560
 who wants to lie to them and tell them

1322
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,920
 that maybe because they've listened to liars too long

1323
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,760
 that you wouldn't want them.

1324
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,360
 And I pray that they would see you

1325
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,760
 for the kind God that you are.

1326
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,960
 I pray that they would see you as the lover that you are,

1327
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,200
 that your toes are at the end of the ranch

1328
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,560
 and you wanna run to them.

1329
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,080
 And all it takes is them just saying,

1330
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
 but Lord, I have squandered my life on loose living

1331
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,400
 and wine and women or whatever it is.

1332
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,600
 I've been that woman, I've been that man

1333
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,280
 that's tried to find life apart from you

1334
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,160
 and I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.

1335
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,480
 And Lord, when they come to you,

1336
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,800
 I know they're gonna find grace and forgiveness.

1337
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,520
 I know you say you're the God who,

1338
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,880
 even though their sins are red as scarlet,

1339
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,760
 will make 'em white as snow.

1340
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,520
 I know that you say that you'll restore the years

1341
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,840
 the locusts have eaten.

1342
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,000
 We thank you, Father, that you can even relay tracks.

1343
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,880
 You can help our mind not to be conformed to the world,

1344
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,080
 but you can transform us.

1345
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,520
 You can bring healing to our mind.

1346
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,280
 It's gonna take some diligence, it's gonna take some work,

1347
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,040
 but we can start to be people that listen to you.

1348
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,080
 And by grace are restored.

1349
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,980
 And by faith, we seek you because we know that you're good.

1350
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,320
 And we reject the bad advice that your word's not true,

1351
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,000
 that you don't have our best interest in mind

1352
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,240
 and that disobeying you's not that big a deal.

1353
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,200
 And we run to you and we fear that we would miss

1354
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,300
 another word because we see your goodness.

1355
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,080
 Father, I pray that that story be multiplied in this room

1356
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,720
 and other rooms like this across the country

1357
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,060
 time and time and time again,

1358
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,200
 that we wouldn't stunt our growth and maturity

1359
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,680
 by numbing ourself with fleeting moments

1360
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,440
 of irresponsibility, but we'd be fully alive, fully awake,

1361
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,880
 more deeply in love with you.

1362
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,160
 Thank you, Father, that everybody in this room

1363
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,860
 can come to Jesus, be forgiven, and grow,

1364
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:26,560
 be healed, to God be the glory.

1365
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:32,560
 - That's what we do here at the porch.

1366
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,440
 We bless his name.

1367
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,920
 We're just telling you the truth.

1368
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,360
 When you bless, you speak well.

1369
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,240
 That's what the word means.

1370
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,920
 We speak well of God's name.

1371
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,400
 There's so many of us, gang, who have walked,

1372
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,120
 not just in the valley of the shadow of death,

1373
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,760
 we have been death to ourselves.

1374
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,960
 We've invited others into it.

1375
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,480
 We've been those mockers.

1376
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,280
 And while wisdom does laugh at you, wisdom is not God.

1377
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,720
 Wisdom is God's, and that's why he's calling you

1378
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,240
 and standing at the corner of the street saying,

1379
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,480
 "Come, come.

1380
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,820
 "If you're gonna dwell in the house of the Lord,

1381
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,960
 "you've gotta come to it."

1382
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,520
 And he is here, and the Father whose house you have left

1383
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,680
 is ready to run to you.

1384
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,120
 Some of you guys don't think you've walked

1385
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
 through the valley of the shadow of death.

1386
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,680
 Some of you guys are out there going, "I'm dead, Todd.

1387
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,880
 "If you knew what I did, you wouldn't think

1388
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,720
 "that I could come."

1389
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,640
 No, you need to know something.

1390
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,640
 God, I don't care if you're wrapped in grave clothes,

1391
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,600
 he can say to you, "Lazarus, come out."

1392
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,240
 He can call you right now tonight,

1393
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,480
 and he's saying to you, "Come, be healed.

1394
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,800
 "Though your sins are red as scarlet,

1395
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,280
 "I can make 'em white as snow."

1396
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,000
 You're not a lost cause.

1397
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,480
 You're mine, you're lost.

1398
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,380
 Come, find life in me.

1399
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,600
 That's what Jesus says.

1400
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,680
 That's what I have found.

1401
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,440
 I have listened to the lies that only the good die young.

1402
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,800
 You know you're dead.

1403
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,520
 Will you let him breathe life into you?

1404
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,160
 Those of you that know that there is life to be found,

1405
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,200
 will you be a friend,

1406
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,080
 and will you be companions to one another

1407
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,200
 as you walk through the valley,

1408
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,240
 the shadow of your 20s?

1409
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,480
 You're not to do it alone.

1410
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,120
 You're to do it with other people who sing

1411
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,760
 of the goodness and mercy of God,

1412
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,520
 who remind you that he's kind.

1413
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,820
 We know it's hard.

1414
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,680
 In this world, you're gonna have trouble,

1415
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,160
 but take heart, he has overcome this world,

1416
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,600
 and he can overcome your sin,

1417
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,120
 and the scars, and the hard wiring.

1418
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,320
 He can transform it, but you've gotta stop

1419
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,220
 putting recipes of death in your bowl.

1420
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,760
 He is the God of the young.

1421
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:16,280
 He wants to shepherd you and rescue you.

1422
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,200
 Will you come to him?

1423
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,560
 There will be a team here and wherever you are

1424
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,400
 to sit and visit with you.

1425
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,960
 Would you come tonight and let us tell you

1426
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,440
 about the goodness and mercy of our God?

1427
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,280
 We love you, Ports.

1428
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,140
 We love you, people who are listening.

1429
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,240
 Come and find life with us in the goodness of God.

1430
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,080
 Have a great night.
