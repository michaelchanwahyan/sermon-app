[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   (drum roll)
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Kira mentioned that we have something exciting
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.880]   coming up next week.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.200]   I'm gonna tell you what that is.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960]   The launch retreat is here, it's back.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.040]   Registration next week.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.960]   Has anyone been to launch in this crowd before?
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.160]   Anyone in Fort Worth been to launch before?
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.120]   Here's why I tell you that,
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.360]   because you are going to want to make sure
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.480]   you are here next Tuesday night,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.600]   or if you can't be here, that you register online.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.520]   If you don't know what the launch retreat is,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.400]   ask someone who raised their hand and was excited.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.280]   You're not going to want to miss out.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.080]   It's like the single funnest three days
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.320]   by a lake that we do.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.320]   We go out to Sky Ranch, it's a blast.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.480]   There's only a thousand spots,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.360]   and it's gonna sell out in two to three days, maybe more.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.400]   In the last couple years,
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.520]   it's sold out in three to four days.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.200]   So we're telling you now,
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.000]   so that if you have never been,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.960]   or if you don't know whether to be here next week,
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.000]   you're going to want to be here next week.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240]   Or make sure you're online, seven o'clock,
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.600]   you can register online.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   One of my favorite launch graphics we've ever had,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.400]   every year we have like a theme,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400]   and then we have graphics and speakers
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.480]   and all kinds of stuff that come with it.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.200]   And one of my favorite graphics we ever had
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.920]   was actually this one from 2010,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   which I think they're going,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.560]   there it is right there, launch.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.040]   And here's why it was both my favorite and not favorite,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.000]   maybe just the most memorable one I had,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.200]   is because it has on it a magic eye.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.040]   There it is.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   You guys see this?
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880]   Remember magic eye, reading "Rainbow Days," magic eye?
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.760]   So inside of that picture,
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.080]   I don't know if you're like me,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   but I have never in my life been able to see
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.440]   whatever is in that picture.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.920]   It's like everyone's, there's a conspiracy going on,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.080]   'cause all I see is specks.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.280]   Can anyone see it right now?
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.080]   Anyone?
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.880]   No, nobody can?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.560]   Okay, we got a couple in there.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.320]   What kind of picture is this back there, tech team?
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.800]   It is birds.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.640]   Here's what I love about it,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.680]   is that if you're like the kind of person like me,
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.440]   is anyone like me where you can't?
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.400]   Am I alone here?
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.680]   I can't ever see the graphic that's up there?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.920]   If you're that person, everyone who can see it,
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.360]   like our friends down here, is like,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.200]   here's what you need to do.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.760]   You just need to blur your eyes and cross it a little bit
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.440]   and look through it, but don't, but just relax,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   but let it come into focus.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   And you're like, is this a joke right now?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.040]   Are you messing with me?
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.720]   And then it feels like you're left out,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.960]   'cause they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.680]   this is unbelievable in there.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.240]   It's a secret code.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.720]   And now you're not able to see it,
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.080]   and you feel left out.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.480]   Because you, for whatever reason,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000]   don't possess whatever it takes.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.160]   I mean, literally, for as long as I can remember,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.000]   I've never been able to like see whatever's in these things.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.960]   It's as though my like brain or something,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.720]   I don't have the gene that allows me to see it.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.240]   I don't have what it takes to see whatever is there.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.800]   And the reason I set up with that story
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.240]   is because tonight, we are going to discuss a topic
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.680]   about what the Bible says you must have
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.320]   in order to see heaven.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.120]   In other words, we're gonna talk about the quality
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.880]   that you must possess and I must possess
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.840]   if you don't want to be left out of seeing heaven.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.440]   Because I know one thing about all of us in the room,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.400]   even if you're like, I don't know what I believe,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.040]   if there is a heaven and a hell,
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.160]   we would like to possess whatever it takes to go to heaven.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.880]   No one's like, oh, I'm kind of 50/50.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.120]   Everyone's very confident that they would like to possess
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.560]   whatever that is.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.040]   And so tonight, we're really gonna discuss
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.960]   what that is because here's,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.080]   I'm gonna give you the punchline
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.040]   and then we're gonna explore it.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.720]   What the Bible says you and I must have
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   in order for us to see heaven is we must be born again.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.800]   And before I lose you and you're going, born again,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.640]   what does that mean?
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.960]   Culture, there's a lot of terms.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.440]   You've probably heard that phrase, born again.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.120]   Tonight, we're gonna discuss what the Bible says
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.720]   as it relates to this topic.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.240]   And it may not be what you think,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.960]   but it does tell us if you do not meet the prerequisites,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.920]   if you don't have this one thing, you will not see heaven.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   What do I mean by that?
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.160]   You will not see Jesus, you will go to hell.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.040]   That's the plainest way that I can say it.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.920]   If you do not have this thing that we're talking about.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.160]   So tonight, we're gonna discuss
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.080]   what it means to be born again.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.560]   Does it look a certain way?
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.800]   Does it mean you're a Republican?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.040]   Does it mean that you live in a certain area?
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.280]   What does it mean to be born again?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.480]   And we're really gonna find the meaning of this
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.840]   in one of everyone's favorite stories in the Bible,
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.560]   the story of Nicodemus.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.760]   Okay, no one's favorite story,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.400]   but in the story of Nicodemus,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.480]   we're gonna be in John chapter three.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.360]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open there now.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.480]   Here's what we're doing for the next two weeks.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.120]   We're really taking a break
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.160]   before we launch into our series this summer,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.200]   which is gonna be called Summer on the Mount.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.440]   Or for the next 10 weeks, starting in June,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.280]   we will go through the greatest sermon ever told by Jesus.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.040]   And for the next two weeks, we're gonna do two one-offs.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.240]   And as I was looking, along with a team and JP,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.160]   we were just praying through what to teach tonight,
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.240]   I couldn't think of a more important message
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   for our audience than to discuss a criteria
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.440]   that we know not everyone in the room has,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.320]   large numbers of you don't have,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.360]   which is you are not able to see
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.520]   and you will not see heaven.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.800]   And so tonight, we're gonna discuss and explore
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.080]   how that relates to the subject of being born again
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.480]   and what it means to be born again.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.600]   A question asked by our man, Nicodemus.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.400]   We're gonna be in John chapter three.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.880]   If you have a Bible, you can open there
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.600]   and we're really gonna look at John chapter three
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.880]   and we're also gonna trace his story
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.760]   throughout the rest of the book of John.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.400]   So we're gonna start in verse one and I will read it
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.680]   and then kind of summarize.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.400]   You guys there, everyone there?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.240]   All right, if not, it's on the screen.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.800]   Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus,
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.120]   who was also a member of the Jewish ruling council.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.320]   He came to Jesus at night and said,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.120]   "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.560]   "who has come from God,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.840]   "for no one could perform the signs that you were doing
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.560]   "if God was not with him."
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.400]   Jesus replied, "Very truly, I tell you,
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.720]   "no one can see the kingdom of God
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.960]   "unless they are born again."
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.240]   "How can someone be born when they are old?"
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.840]   Nicodemus asked.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.280]   "Surely they cannot enter a second time
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.480]   "into their mother's womb to be born."
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.280]   Jesus answered, "Very truly, I tell you,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.240]   "no one can enter the kingdom of God
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.680]   "unless they are born of water and of spirit.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.800]   "Flesh gives birth to flesh
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.000]   "and spirit gives birth to spirit."
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   So here's what just happened.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.840]   So Nicodemus, this is early on in Jesus's ministry.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.640]   So very early on, Jesus was doing ministry
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.520]   essentially for three years on the planet.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.560]   Early in the game, he's doing miracles,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.480]   he's getting a lot of people behind him,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.960]   he's becoming increasingly popular.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.040]   And Nicodemus, who's a Pharisee,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.120]   Nicodemus is on Jerusalem's who's who list,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.960]   that's who he is.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.120]   He's not only a religious,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.520]   at the top of the religious chart,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.480]   which in those days, it was like,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.200]   if we have baseball cards for famous people,
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.760]   they have like religious cards for people
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.320]   because the Pharisees were like,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.840]   "Oh man, that's what I wanna be when I grow up."
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.080]   And so Nicodemus is not only that guy,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.520]   but he is a member of the ruling council
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.840]   in terms of he's a part of the Senate that rules the city.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   So he's very influential politically and religiously.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.600]   He's a guy that everywhere he went,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.880]   he has an entourage with him.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   And Nicodemus hears of this man, Jesus, and he's curious.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.720]   So he goes to him at night,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.320]   maybe so that no one else would see,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.040]   no one on this Sanhedrin, that's the ruling council,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.920]   would see that he goes to this man,
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.720]   this new rabbi on the scene,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.040]   and he goes to him and he's sitting around
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.680]   a campfire with Jesus.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.080]   And he begins to kind of like,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.040]   walk through introductions.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.520]   "Hey, I'm Nicodemus, me and my associates,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   "here, we know that you are clearly a good man from God,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.800]   "we're men of God, we thought we could be friends."
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.200]   And Jesus, mid-sentence, cuts him off.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.520]   And it's as though Jesus is like,
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.440]   "Let's get right to the point.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   "No one can see the kingdom of God
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   "unless they are born again."
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.600]   And Nicodemus doesn't get it at all.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.880]   Like he's going, "What, what are you talking about?
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.680]   "Born again, born again?
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.520]   "I'm supposed to crawl into my mother's womb?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.880]   "That's a little graphic, Jesus.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   "Can't think about that too long.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.720]   "What do you mean that I'm supposed to be born again?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.920]   "And how can I be born again when I'm old?"
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.320]   Clearly he's not understanding.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.160]   And we hear that and we're like,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.680]   "Come on, come on, Nicodemus, it's a metaphor, buddy.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.240]   "Get with the picture."
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.000]   But Nicodemus has never heard this before.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.040]   So he's going, "Wait, why are you talking about my mama
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.680]   "and what am I supposed to do to enter the kingdom of God?"
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.360]   And Jesus responds, "Very truly, I tell you, no one can,"
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.280]   so let me explain what I mean.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.360]   "Enter the kingdom of God unless they're born of water,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.520]   "physical birth, and born of the Spirit.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.960]   "Flesh gives birth to flesh."
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.040]   In other words, camels give birth to camels,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.600]   dogs, dogs, humans to humans,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.280]   but the Spirit gives birth to the Spirit,
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.480]   which brings us to our first point.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.960]   You and I are blind without a new birth.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.880]   You and I are blind without a new birth.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.240]   You will not see and I will not see the kingdom of God.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   And he says to Nicodemus, "You will not,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.520]   "if you do not experience a new birth."
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.720]   And it's not a birth unlike your first birth,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   though it doesn't involve your mother,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.000]   in the same way that your original birth took place,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.920]   where flesh caused the birth of flesh,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.800]   Spirit caused the birth of Spirit.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.000]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.680]   In the same way that you were not really responsible
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.880]   for any part of you coming into this world,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.280]   and I wasn't responsible for it,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.520]   our parents brought us into this world.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.280]   If you've ever seen "Pregnancy,"
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.840]   we have close friends right now that are pregnant,
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.840]   and pregnancy is such a terrible season of life for people,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.040]   like morning sickness and nausea.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.400]   There should be like five Mother's Days a year,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.560]   because what women go through
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.240]   to bring children into this world,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.120]   and so many, preach!
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.440]   And so all along, the moms changing what they eat,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   and they're trying to figure out
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.240]   what I can eat and can't eat,
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.760]   and they're getting sleep adjustments,
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.640]   and they're trying to make all these different sacrifices
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.000]   to bring the kid in, and you know who does nothing
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.160]   to bring themselves into the world,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.320]   or nothing in the process?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.160]   The child.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.400]   The dad barely does more,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.160]   and he does the one thing that he enjoys,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.960]   and so the child does very little to bring in himself,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.800]   or nothing to bring himself into the world.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.720]   That's what birth is.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.280]   Jesus just said, "The Spirit gives birth to the Spirit."
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.200]   In other words, you, just like you weren't a part
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.000]   of your mom bringing you in, Nicodemus,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.840]   here's how you have to be born again,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.720]   and it's not a birth that you can control.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.920]   The way you get born again is not by you trying to do more,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.760]   it's not by some work.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.840]   The only way you'll see the kingdom of God
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.000]   is by birth, not work, which raises the question,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.720]   like how can a person be born again?
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.160]   And Nicodemus is taken back,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.320]   because here's what I know, and I'm confident,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.080]   Nicodemus is the guy.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.520]   If there's a religious leader who's like,
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.040]   "Yeah, people come to me, and they ask questions."
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.120]   When you get done with the born again,
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   I'll share you my opinion too, Jesus.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.640]   Nicodemus is the guy who's like,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.160]   "If anyone is getting into heaven, it's me."
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.920]   I mean, look at my resume.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.880]   I am the leader of God's chosen people, the Jews.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.800]   If anyone is leading up the charge about like,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.080]   "Hey, we're God's chosen people, the Jews,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.680]   "give me a J, give me an E, give me a W,"
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.600]   that's who we are, and I'm the one leading
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.080]   the pep rally from the front, Jesus.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.520]   How dare you tell me that despite being in church
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.160]   every Sunday, reading my Bible,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.120]   knowing a lot of Bible verses, being a good kid,
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.200]   that I'm not getting in, that I lack?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.080]   And how, and what does it look like to even be born again?
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.320]   And Jesus is gonna answer that, verse seven.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.740]   "You should not be surprised," Jesus speaking,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.040]   "at my saying, you must be born again.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.880]   "The wind blows wherever it pleases.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.620]   "You hear the sound, but you cannot tell
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.380]   "where it comes from or where it is going.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.700]   "So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.960]   "How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.060]   "You were Israel's teacher," said Jesus,
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.840]   "and you do not understand these things?
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.880]   "Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know,
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.040]   "and we testify of what we have seen,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.060]   "but still you people do not accept our testimony.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.680]   "I have spoken to you of earthly things,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.560]   "and you do not believe.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.520]   "How then will you believe if I speak to you
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.060]   "of heavenly things?
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.060]   "No one has ever gone into heaven,
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.420]   "except the one who has come from heaven, the Son of Man."
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.440]   Let's stop there.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.680]   So what Jesus just said is basically,
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.400]   hey, just like, let me explain how you can know
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.320]   that you've been born again.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   Just like when there's a, we're sitting in front of a fire,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.640]   and the fire all of a sudden,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.320]   remember if you've ever been to a campfire
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.280]   any time recently, and you're like sitting around
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.680]   with your little chairs around the fire,
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.000]   and the wind will change directions,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.920]   and all of a sudden you're like not in the smoke,
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.760]   and then all of a sudden you're like,
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.920]   okay, everyone shift over, and then it's again,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.040]   and you're like, okay, shift back,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.360]   and you don't know where it's gonna go next.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.520]   Jesus just said, in the same way,
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.720]   that's what it's like in someone's life.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.040]   Like you can't see the wind, but you can tell it's there.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.680]   You can see the evidence of it, and he says,
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.140]   in the same way, you can't see the rebirth take place,
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.580]   but there is evidence that it's there,
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.040]   and he's about to give us what that is.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.960]   Verse 14, "Just as Moses lifted up the snake
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.800]   "in the wilderness,"
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.200]   so what he just referenced, gosh, this is such a cool story.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.040]   Who should have more time?
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.280]   So what he just referenced is a story that you and I
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.960]   are like, that's not my favorite story,
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.400]   but Nicodemus would have been well acquainted with.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.560]   "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness,"
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.040]   what are you talking about, Jesus?
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.640]   "In the book of Numbers," which is in the Old Testament,
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   "it tells the story of the nation of Israel
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.480]   "traveling through the wilderness."
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.600]   And in one of those chapters, chapter 21,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.120]   it lays out this one that seems like random story
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.200]   in the Old Testament, and here's what happened.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.520]   Moses leads the people out of slavery,
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.120]   and they're all making camp outside in the wilderness,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.880]   and everyone's set up, and they find a place
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.040]   they're gonna make camp, and they've got campfires going,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.360]   and s'mores, and their tents all set up,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.600]   and then all of a sudden, there's not s'mores,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.800]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.760]   all these snakes start coming out,
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.280]   and they're biting all the people.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.940]   This is like "Game of Thrones" stuff.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.280]   All the people, thousands, if not millions of people,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.960]   are in these tents, and all of a sudden,
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.760]   all of these serpents come out and begin to bite the people,
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.040]   and the people are dying in droves.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.080]   Moses runs to God, and he goes into this tent,
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.040]   and he goes, "God, what am I supposed to do?
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.080]   "Everyone's dying, there's serpents everywhere."
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.380]   And God says, "Here's what I want you to do.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.760]   "I want you to take a pole with a crossbeam,
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.360]   "and I want you to put a serpent on it."
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.180]   Don't get bit.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.640]   "And I want you to put a serpent on the crossbeam."
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.680]   And it's like, what, that feels really random.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.360]   "Then I want you to run to the center of the camp,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.840]   "and I want you to raise up the serpent
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.480]   "and place it in the center of the camp.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.760]   "And everyone who looks at the serpent will be healed."
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.120]   Everyone, if you could drag your family member over there,
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.880]   and you could just point them in the direction,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.800]   if they look at that, they will be healed.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.840]   And Jesus just said, "Just like that,
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.760]   "so everyone," verse 15, "so the Son of Man
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   "must be lifted up, that everyone who,"
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.240]   what does it look like to be born again?
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.740]   What's the evidence?
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.720]   "Believes may have eternal life."
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.040]   That Jesus just said that the evidence
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.580]   of a person being born again is that they believe,
[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.640]   which brings us to our second point.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.320]   New birth comes from new belief.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.820]   What does it look like to be born again?
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.140]   How can I be a born again, or a person who knows
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.360]   that I have been born again?
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.200]   Which, if that's the only way to enter eternal life,
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.240]   I think all of us would say, "I think I'd take that door."
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.280]   All of us would take that, and Jesus just said,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.820]   "The only way that you can be born again,
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.460]   "or how you can know, is if you believe,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.140]   "so that everyone who believes in the Son
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.840]   "may have eternal life."
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.480]   This is how you can know you have the new birth,
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.020]   that Jesus, and really, the entire Gospels
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.360]   introduced this idea.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.320]   The issue is not whosoever behaves.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.500]   It is whosoever believes.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.240]   The issue of sin is not the problem
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.240]   in keeping someone from experiencing eternal life.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.080]   This is so huge.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.840]   If you're back in church for the first time in a long time,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.160]   I hope you don't miss, tune out,
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.120]   and count the ceiling tiles,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.900]   if you miss everything else after this.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.940]   The issue of you and your life,
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.800]   and whether or not you can have right standing with God,
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.140]   does not depend on sin.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.360]   The issue is, do you believe?
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.720]   The issue is, who are you trusting in?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.960]   Because if you go, "No, but I'm too bad of a person."
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.320]   That is you trusting in yourself,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.400]   in what you have done.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.000]   And Jesus says, "Whoever believes."
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.440]   The issue is, do you believe?
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.880]   Or do you trust?
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.160]   Who are you trusting in?
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.760]   Jesus said, "Whoever puts their trust in me,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.680]   "the Son of Man, lifted up."
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.280]   That person will have eternal life.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.760]   The issue is, do you believe?
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.200]   And John really punctuates this by giving us
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.040]   maybe the most famous verse in the Bible,
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.440]   a verse regardless of your religious background,
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.400]   you've probably heard before.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.040]   Thanks to Tim Tebow and Austin 316,
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.440]   where it says this,
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   "For God so loved,"
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.820]   Austin 316, haven't heard that name in a while.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.440]   "For God so loved the world,
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.520]   "that he gave his one and only Son,
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   "that whoever believes in him,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.040]   "shall not perish, but have eternal life."
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.360]   What is the evidence of a person being born again
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.280]   that they believe?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.200]   How do you know that the Spirit
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.040]   gives birth to spirit inside of you?
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.680]   Do you believe that Jesus on the cross
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.800]   paid for your sin?
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.280]   That whosoever believes,
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.100]   shall not perish, but have eternal life?
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.380]   The Bible teaches,
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.240]   it is not good people who go to heaven,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.080]   and bad people who go to hell.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.260]   It's forgiven people who go to heaven.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.360]   Forgiven from who?
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.200]   From God.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.920]   And the only way you can have forgiveness
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.120]   is if you will accept it.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.840]   And he's offered it in the free gift
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.440]   that Jesus gave us when he died on a cross,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.040]   and whoever puts their trust,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   God says, "I've given my Son,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.500]   "and whoever trusts in him,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.680]   "will have eternal life."
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.600]   They've been born again.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.720]   They've been changed.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.520]   And Nicodemus is having all of his categories blown,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.480]   and he's going, "What?
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.240]   "How dare you even talk to me
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.880]   "like this rabbi random guy?
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.640]   "I'm the Jewish leader,
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.760]   "the teacher of Israel.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.660]   "You're telling me that I don't have
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.800]   "what it takes?"
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.120]   And he goes back to his other Sanhedrin buddies,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.000]   and they're like, "How'd it go?"
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.120]   And he was like, "He wasn't home."
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.880]   And they go on in life,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.760]   and Nicodemus continues to watch Jesus from afar.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.080]   And the story really only gets better from there,
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.360]   and here's what happened next.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.920]   So that's John three,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.200]   and kind of the next few chapters.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.760]   Jesus's ministry continues to grow,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.880]   and to grow, and to grow.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.280]   And the Pharisees,
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.380]   which is Nick and all his boys,
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.780]   they see Jesus and his crowd continuing,
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.140]   all of his fans and followers continuing to grow,
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.860]   and they're like, "We gotta put a stop to this."
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.420]   And then Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.820]   He tells this man who had been lame for 38 years,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.860]   "I want you to get up, and I want you to walk."
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.580]   And the Pharisees are going,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.220]   he did not just move his mat on the Sabbath.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.260]   This is a game changer.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.700]   We gotta get Jesus right now.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.100]   So here's what they do.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.660]   They get the temple guards together,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.180]   and the temple guards were not like the Roman centurions.
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.360]   Temple guards were like the mall cops,
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.140]   or campus police, you know?
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.320]   Where you're like, "Can you arrest me?
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.360]   "Where would you take me?
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.560]   "Do you have a gun?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.800]   "Is that a taser?"
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.120]   They're the guys who you're like,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.760]   "I don't know if I'm off the campus.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.520]   "Do you have authority out here?"
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.600]   That's the temple guards.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.040]   They're the temple guards, but they have like spears.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.200]   And so here's what happens.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.820]   The Pharisees and the Sanhedrin are like,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.340]   "I want you to go get Jesus.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.120]   "He's gonna be at the Feast of Booths."
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.200]   The Feast of Booths, this is in John 7.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.720]   So he was the man, and then this huge event
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.000]   called the Feast of Booths,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.360]   which was a really cool event in Jewish history,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.760]   or in Jewish celebrations.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.960]   Here's what it was.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.520]   The Feast of Booths was like Woodstock.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.360]   It sincerely was.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.700]   Everyone would get Feast of Booths or Feast of Tents,
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.220]   where everyone, it was a celebration, seven days,
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.880]   and it was the harvest, so they're drinking wine,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.680]   and they're all hanging out in their tents
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.760]   outside the city.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.500]   That's literally what the festival was.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.620]   So everyone comes together.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.420]   It was literally the biggest festival
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.400]   because everyone came from everywhere to be a part of it.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.780]   They're like, "I am not missing that one.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.860]   "I'm okay with missing the other ones,
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.200]   "but that one I'm gonna be a part of."
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.580]   So Woodstock is going on, so they know Jesus will be there.
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.620]   Jesus is gonna show up
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.380]   because there's more people in Jerusalem than ever.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.380]   He's gonna show up and wanna teach.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.420]   And so temple guards, we want you to go arrest him.
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.220]   We want you to go find him and go arrest him.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.400]   And so here's what happens.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.720]   The festival goes on, Jesus does show up, he's teaching,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   and the Pharisees in Sanhedrin are waiting,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.040]   and they're going, "When is this guy
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.340]   "getting back with Jesus?"
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.980]   And then they see the guards starting to walk down the hill
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.100]   or walk towards the temple where they're waiting,
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.580]   and they say this, "Finally, the temple,"
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.840]   this is verse 45 of chapter seven,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.920]   "Finally, the temple guards went back
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.660]   "to the chief priests and Pharisees,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.100]   "who asked them, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'"
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.340]   So the temple guards come back and they don't have Jesus.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.040]   And they say, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.740]   And they go, I love this,
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.360]   "No one has ever spoke the way this man does,"
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.780]   the guards replied.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.800]   And the priests are going, "What, you listened to a message?
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.220]   "You sat there in the audience and you listened to a message?
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.360]   "We told you to arrest him."
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.060]   Yeah, but he was in the middle of an illustration.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.380]   We didn't wanna interrupt.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.620]   Literally, that's what happened.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.060]   And they're going, "Oh my gosh, Barney Fife, you guys,
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.780]   "okay, we're gonna have to come up with another plan.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.380]   "You mean he deceived you too?"
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.300]   Verse 47, "The Pharisees retorted,
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.860]   "Have any of the rulers of the Pharisees believed in him?
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.320]   "No, but this mob knows nothing of the law.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.180]   "There's a curse on them."
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.220]   And here's our boy again.
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.640]   "Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.980]   "and who was one of their number, asked,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.600]   "'Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.240]   "'to find out what he has been doing?'
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.620]   "And the Sanhedrin replied to him,
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.360]   "'Are you from Galilee too?'
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.060]   "Then Nicodemus appears again."
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.940]   And he's not totally without providing a little defense,
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.280]   but he's still timid and going,
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.600]   "Look, guys, clearly it's wrong for you to arrest him,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.380]   "but maybe it's okay."
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.860]   And they say, "Are you from Galilee too?"
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.340]   And he's like, "I was just kidding."
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.240]   And so we continue, and here's what happens next.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.780]   So the next couple chapters, Jesus,
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.500]   and this is really over a picture of the book of John.
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.480]   Jesus continues and his ministry keeps growing.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.520]   And then he heals this man who had been blind.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.760]   His whole life he'd been born blind, John 9.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.080]   And he continues to insult or continues to buy him
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.680]   and his ministry growing insult these religious leaders.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.600]   And then the last straw is broken in John 11
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.920]   with Lazarus, this man who died.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.540]   Jesus shows up and he says,
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.720]   "Take the stone away from the tomb."
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.660]   And they said, "Jesus, he's been dead for four days.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.720]   "It's gonna smell terrible.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.340]   "Just tell him goodbye from here."
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.760]   And Jesus says, "Take the stone away.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.080]   "Lazarus, come forward."
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.120]   And Lazarus walks out of the tomb alive.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.400]   And now Jesus is like a celebrity
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.920]   like they've never seen before.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.460]   And it literally says from that day on,
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.640]   they plotted we're gonna kill Lazarus and Jesus.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.040]   So they get the temple guards together,
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.300]   and they decide, "Hey, we're gonna give you
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.340]   "one more shot, mall cop.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.700]   "You're gonna go, we're gonna tell you exactly where he is.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.320]   "We have an insider, his name is Judas.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.960]   "He sold his master.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.040]   "We're gonna tell you exactly where to go.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.280]   "Judas is going to point out exactly who to arrest.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.020]   "We want you to bring him back here.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.520]   "This needs to be put to an end."
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.840]   And so that's exactly what happens.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.400]   They go, Judas betrays him,
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.920]   and they arrest Jesus in the garden at night.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.480]   And they bring him back.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.020]   The temple guards bring him to the temple.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.920]   And they have this trial, this illegal trial.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.040]   Where Jesus is brought before the Sanhedrin,
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.680]   and he's brought, and they accuse him of blasphemy,
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.280]   saying, "You claim to be the son of God."
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.320]   And they slap him in the face, the scripture tells us.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.640]   And they say, "Take it back."
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.400]   And Jesus says, "You've spoken it."
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.800]   And they rip their clothes,
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.000]   and they say, "This man deserves to die."
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.840]   But here's like the kicker.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.480]   Jews couldn't crucify or couldn't execute someone.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.340]   So they go, "Well, what are we gonna do?"
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.460]   "We're gonna take him to Pilate."
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.420]   Pilate's the governor, he's a Roman,
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.300]   he doesn't have any religion, he'll do it for us.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.900]   And so we'll bring him to Pilate.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.620]   So they bring him to Pilate,
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.100]   and they gather outside Pilate's house,
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.900]   and they say, "This man is a criminal
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.260]   "who needs to be executed."
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.300]   And Pilate's always seeing the Jews stirring stuff up,
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.180]   going, "What has he done?"
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.660]   And they say, "You can ask him."
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.020]   So Pilate brings him to not upset them,
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.220]   and he brings him inside, and he begins to interview him.
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.920]   And they say, "He claimed to be the king of the Jews.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.000]   "He's not our king."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.020]   And Pilate sits there, and he goes,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.260]   "What have you done to make these people so angry?
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.400]   "Are you the king of the Jews?"
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.000]   And Jesus says, "My kingdom's not of this world."
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.400]   And Pilate's going, "So you are a king," is what he says.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.820]   And Pilate's going, "Look, this guy's not deserving of death.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:36.840]   "He may be a little woo-woo,
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.960]   "but he's not deserving of death."
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.680]   So he brings him back outside,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.760]   and by this time, there's a crowd gathering
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.480]   outside Pilate's house.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.040]   There's a crowd that's sitting there,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.920]   and he says, "Look, I'm not gonna kill this guy.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.040]   "Finally, he's a criminal.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.720]   "You guys have a thing every year
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.520]   "where you release one criminal on Passover,
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.820]   "so I'm gonna let him go.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.160]   "He'll be your guy."
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.080]   And they begin to shout in the crowd,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.160]   "No, give us Barabbas.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.920]   "Give us Barabbas, the rebel, the murderer.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.000]   "Give us Barabbas."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.160]   And Pilate's going, "Give you Barabbas?
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.300]   "This man hasn't done anything.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.200]   "What should I do with him?"
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.620]   And then someone begins to yell, "Crucify him!
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.640]   "Crucify him!"
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.040]   And the chant begins to go,
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.520]   and Pilate takes him away, saying,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.260]   "I'm not gonna crucify.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.320]   "That's like giving lethal injection
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.680]   "for a speeding ticket, guys.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.520]   "You don't do that.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   "I'm not gonna crucify."
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.560]   Crucifixion was only for the worst of the worst.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.400]   Come on, Jesus.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.680]   And he takes him back inside,
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.820]   and Pilate says, "You know what I'll do?
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.680]   "I'll just have him flogged.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.020]   "I'll have his back and his body permanently disfigured,
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.160]   "which is what flogging was,
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.000]   "this whip that would go around you with knives and glass."
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.440]   And he says, "I'll just beat this man
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.300]   "into an inch of his life being taken,
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.880]   "and then they'll be happy and they'll be fine."
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.300]   So Jesus is whipped,
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.600]   and while the Roman centurions are whipping him,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.000]   they go, "His charge is he's the king?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.320]   "Well, let's make him a crown."
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.960]   And they form this thorn, or this crown of thorns,
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.440]   and they put a robe, a purple robe over him.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.300]   And Jesus, covered in his own blood,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:17.620]   stumbles out, blood coming from his forehead,
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.380]   and Pilate says, "Take your king away."
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   And the chant continues.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.080]   "Crucify him, he's not our king.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.020]   "Crucify him."
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.900]   And then someone in the crowd says this,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.540]   "You are no friend of Caesar's if you don't kill this king.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.020]   "Anyone who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's,
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.620]   "and if you're a friend of Jesus,
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.700]   "you are no friend of Caesar's."
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.840]   And Pilate knows that's game over,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.720]   because if I support and allow this man to go free,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.960]   they're gonna say, "I'm not a friend of Caesar.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.480]   "That's the only friend that I have."
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.640]   And so he says, "Take him away, crucify him."
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.120]   The disciples flee, they don't go see the crucifixion.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.000]   Only John.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.840]   And then John records something really
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.080]   you wouldn't have thought.
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.020]   That happens next.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.940]   Jesus is brought there and he's crucified.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:17.120]   And he's nailed to a cross,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.880]   and then a few hours later he dies.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.300]   And this is what's recorded about his burial.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.900]   Later, Joseph of Arimathea,
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.980]   who was a member of the Sanhedrin,
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.220]   Luke and all the other gospels tell us,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.980]   asked Pilate for the body of Jesus,
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.300]   which was really unusual.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.240]   Crucified men were not buried.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.280]   They were left on the cross for birds to pick at them,
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.240]   and Joseph, this Sanhedrin member,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.280]   did it because here's why.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.400]   Joseph was a disciple of Jesus,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.840]   but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.760]   with Pilate's permission,
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.440]   he came and he took the body away,
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.340]   but he wasn't alone.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.020]   He was accompanied by Nicodemus.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.400]   The man who would come and visited Jesus at night.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.560]   Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.160]   about 75 pounds.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.800]   That was a very enormous amount.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.120]   Nicodemus gave him a burial like a king.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.040]   Nicodemus comes with this man,
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.120]   and they take the body.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.580]   Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.320]   with spices and in strips of linen.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.500]   This was in accordance with Jewish buriable customs.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.960]   Nicodemus and Joseph, who were members of the Sanhedrin,
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.880]   they come and they see the body
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.620]   of this man who was murdered.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.440]   A man who'd done nothing wrong, but healed the sick,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.220]   give sight to the blind,
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.680]   allow lame people to walk, heal lepers,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.040]   and they see him murdered.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.580]   And Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea,
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.000]   a change takes place,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.160]   and they decide we're leaving the Sanhedrin.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.600]   We know that we risk dying for taking this man's body
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.640]   and burying him.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.640]   We're gonna go take him, and we're gonna bury him.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.840]   Men did not bury.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.040]   Women were the ones who would bury bodies.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.720]   But they say, it's fine with me.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.800]   I'm leaving this.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.760]   Nicodemus came to believe,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.240]   and he decided I can no longer be Nick at night.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.440]   I'm now becoming Nick during the day,
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.920]   during any time of life.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.480]   I'm gonna become Nick, who comes,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.840]   and my Lord and Savior died on that cross,
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   and just with Joseph, I'm gonna take this body,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.680]   and I'm gonna bury it.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.580]   And they take the body down from the cross,
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.980]   and they pull the nails out.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.200]   And they carry his body,
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.780]   and they get the blood of Jesus on them.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:32.520]   And they wrap it, and they put it in a tomb.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.320]   And we know by almost all accounts,
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.640]   Nicodemus lost everything for doing so.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.880]   He would have been removed from the Sanhedrin.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.360]   He would have been made unclean.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.280]   He couldn't celebrate Passover that weekend.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.840]   Everything had changed for him,
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.400]   and Nicodemus didn't care because he said, I'm going.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.680]   I believe this man is who he said he was.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.080]   Some point between then, it changed.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.640]   Nicodemus changed.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.800]   And Nick at night was no longer the same.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.360]   And here's what happened.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.440]   I love this.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.480]   Nicodemus standing there with Joseph,
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.240]   and who knows how many others,
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.080]   Jesus' own disciples weren't there as he's dying.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.360]   And he sees this man
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:19.940]   who had done only helpful,
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.420]   only set people free, only restored life.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.640]   And he sees him raised up on a cross.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.560]   And all of a sudden it clicked,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.560]   just as the serpent was raised up on that cross
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.200]   that whoever looks at him would be saved.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.720]   So the Son of Man must be raised up
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.120]   that whoever trusts in him shall not perish,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.160]   but have eternal life.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.520]   And everything clicked.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.340]   Nick realized it's always been about Jesus.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.840]   The whole story of the Old Testament,
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.460]   including the serpent, it's always been about Jesus.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:02.280]   And all of a sudden in his mind, everything changed.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:07.020]   And he knew that even though believing and following Jesus
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.400]   would cost me in this life, it'll cost me a job,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.040]   it'll cost me my home, it'll cost me my income,
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.200]   not following Jesus will cost me far more
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.480]   in this life and the next.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.240]   And whatever it costs me, I'm going to follow this man.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:25.360]   Just as the Son of Man raised up,
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.600]   and everything changed.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.680]   And he became a believer.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:37.880]   This brings us to the third point of our new behavior,
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.080]   his birth, excuse me, from new belief.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.400]   New behavior, his birth from his new belief.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.760]   And standing on a hillside,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.120]   this man who knew every text in the Old Testament
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.920]   about the God and the Messiah who would one day come
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.560]   and be pierced for our transgressions,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.800]   crushed for our iniquity,
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.420]   all of a sudden they all came into focus.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.280]   It's always been about Jesus.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.640]   It will always be about Jesus.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.220]   And he went from skeptic to believer.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:20.220]   I think, really what he did is,
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.480]   I was out walking not long ago,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.400]   and I was walking with my dog.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.960]   Another dog story, here we go.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.240]   And I see this stray dog, and of course,
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.480]   and of course I'm like, oh man.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.800]   And I think it's my neighbor's dog.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.840]   I think I'm like almost positive.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.820]   Oh, that's my neighbor's dog.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.000]   I need to go return it, okay?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.320]   So I go over, give the dog.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.160]   I'm like, great, let's go.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.320]   We're gonna take you home to Bobby.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   And I get over to Bobby's house in his backyard,
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.760]   and his dog's looking back at me.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   And I'm like, who are you?
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.160]   And it wasn't his dog.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.800]   And so I bend down, and I look,
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.160]   and I'm like, oh, okay, I have a number,
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.480]   and I'm gonna call him.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.600]   And I begin to call his owner.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.280]   And all of a sudden, we live in like Old Lake Highlands.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.760]   I'm walking back home, calling the owner.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.800]   Hey, I think I found your dog.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.640]   A storm like I've never seen before in my life,
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.160]   including last night, in the last 30 days.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.480]   A storm like I've never seen in my entire life
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.760]   all of a sudden comes out of nowhere,
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.360]   and there's wind blowing.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.400]   Trees are snapping.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.960]   Power lines are coming down.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.640]   Boxes of trash, I promise you,
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   it's gonna sound like, you're a preacher.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.200]   You're exaggerating.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.120]   I promise I'm not.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.720]   There's boxes flying everywhere.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.360]   And I'm with my dog, and I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.160]   we gotta go, every dog for himself.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.560]   So we take off, and we go run back to my house.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   And we're running to the house.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.760]   All the power's out everywhere.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.160]   It's at night, and I finally, I run into the door,
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.360]   and I'm waiting, and my dog comes in behind me,
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.680]   and I slam the door shut.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.280]   And all of a sudden, I hear this collar.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.400]   That's not mine.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   And it's the other dog in the house.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.720]   And I'm like, how did you get here?
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.160]   And he's like, hey buddy, holla at your boy.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   I'm coming with you.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.680]   And he's in, I promise, it sounds like my wife,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.080]   I've told this story before, my wife's like,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.160]   are you embellishing?
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.840]   I promise, that's what happened.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.160]   And so looking at this dog, and it really,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.000]   here's what happened.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.760]   Like that dog essentially was like, look, I'm no fool.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.840]   I'm going with you, bro.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:16.080]   You're the only chance of protection I have.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.280]   You're the only chance of life and safety I have.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.760]   I'm not staying out here on my own.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.660]   I'm not gonna make it on my own, and I'm coming with you.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.560]   Nicodemus essentially realized what all of us will realize
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.600]   in this life or the next.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.760]   Jesus is the only chance of protection that you and I have.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.560]   All of us have sinned, the Bible said,
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.520]   and by sin, it's both mistakes and more than that.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.640]   All of us have made decisions in our past,
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.080]   in our present, and will in our future,
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.960]   where we go, that was wrong.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.280]   I don't think that's right.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.600]   All of us have fallen short, the Bible says,
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:55.280]   and it says the only chance of protection
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.300]   that you and I have is found at the same shadow
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.040]   of that cross that Nicodemus went to and found protection.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.220]   The only chance of life that you and I share
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.060]   is found there.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.620]   Ironically, the story of Pilate,
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.360]   like how great of a tragedy is this?
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.480]   He's standing eyeball to eyeball
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.280]   with the God of the universe,
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.360]   and he was wondering, and it takes him several times,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.640]   he goes back into that house,
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.900]   and he knows there's something unique about this man,
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.460]   but he never left from wonderer.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.160]   He never left from I'm intrigued, he stayed there,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.280]   unlike Nicodemus, who went from wonderer to believer.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.720]   He went from the man who said, no, I'm a good person,
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.000]   do I need someone to pay for my sin?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.600]   When that cross came lifted up, he looked at his Savior,
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.280]   and everything changed.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.920]   And my fear for some of you in this room
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.680]   is that you're gonna stay a wanderer,
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.040]   you're gonna stay like the tragedy that Pilate was.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.760]   Maybe because you don't think you're a good enough person,
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.520]   maybe because you think that God can't love you
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.480]   based on your path, all of which
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.520]   are examples of trusting in yourself.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.320]   And he says, will you come and trust in me?
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.920]   Come, I paid for it.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.720]   Will you come to the only one who can give you protection
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:21.720]   and life, the one that whoever believes in
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.960]   will not perish, but have eternal life?
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.460]   And you can have that tonight.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.680]   You can know that no matter what comes your way,
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   you will spend eternity with your maker.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.440]   You will spend eternity in paradise.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.760]   And he offers that to you.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.480]   If you'll just trust and just believe.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.040]   I love the story of Nicodemus,
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.600]   and here's why, and I'll close with this.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.160]   Because I'm so much like Nicodemus.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   Like I have a background of being like the church kid
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.000]   and religious rules, and when I read the New Testament,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.280]   sometimes I see like the Pharisee, the religious,
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.560]   gets such a bad rap that I wonder, can God love me?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:06.600]   Which you may go, that's crazy.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.640]   But the story of Nicodemus reminds me that God says,
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.400]   no matter who you are, no matter what you've done,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.080]   no matter how bad you are, how good you think you are,
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.160]   I can save.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.800]   If you come to me, experience the new birth
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.240]   that starts with a new belief
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.360]   and a new trust that I've paid for it.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.240]   Will you come to me and find the only source of protection
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.720]   and the only source of life that any of us have,
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.320]   and you'll see that in this life
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:44.560]   on a day where it's too soon.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.240]   I'm gonna pray that you would come tonight.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.320]   In fact, I wanna invite you,
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.120]   if you're in the room during this last song
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.480]   and you're not sure where you stand with God,
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.880]   don't blow me off right now.
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.560]   I wanna invite you to pray where you are.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.640]   You don't have to raise a hand,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.940]   you don't have to come down front and tell us.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.800]   I want you to invite you to pray where you are, God.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.140]   I am a great sinner.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.740]   I'm trusting that I have a great savior in your son.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:13.760]   If it's true that there's a gift of eternal life
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.680]   totally for free, God, I'm trusting that that
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.440]   will have to be enough,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.640]   that the payment you made on the cross is enough.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.640]   And during this last song, if you'll just begin to pray that
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.240]   and it's the best decision you can make
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.740]   and you can leave here if you trust that,
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.320]   not by saying some magic words,
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.160]   but if you trust and believe that Jesus paid for it,
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.680]   you can leave here knowing
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.340]   that you have the only source of protection
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.260]   from the penalty of sin, the only source of life,
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.060]   and this one and the next there will ever be.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.820]   I'm gonna pray that we do that.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.660]   Father, we love you.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.300]   Thank you for the story of Nicodemus.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.900]   Thank you that you don't give up on us
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.400]   no matter what our story is,
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.140]   that you offer a new life to all of us
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.020]   no matter what we've done,
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:08.820]   no matter who we think we are, that you love us.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.300]   I pray now for my friends in the room
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.660]   who don't know you, Lord,
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.140]   who aren't born again
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.540]   and they're gonna spend eternity away from you.
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.260]   And you've already proved you love them.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.880]   You gave your son who changed the world,
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.240]   who reset the calendar,
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.120]   who offers eternal life, so just trust him.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.560]   Would you by the Spirit give birth to the Spirit now
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.480]   inside of my friends who don't have that spiritual rebirth?
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.680]   We love you, amen.
