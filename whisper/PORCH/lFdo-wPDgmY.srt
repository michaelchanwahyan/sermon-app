1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,320
 Recently I was watching this special ABC did, it was recorded Diane Sawyer kind of led the

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,040
 charge on this deal called Young Guns. And as a parent I saw some really alarming imagery

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,760
 in the show where they just were talking about how many children were coming into the emergency

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,960
 room having been shot by their parents' gun that they found. And so I'm a gun owner, you

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,680
 know, a CHL holder. And so as I'm watching this thing, it's always funny to me, as I'm

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,080
 watching this, as I'm watching this video and just, and just a parent, you know, of three

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,920
 kids, it just kind of grabs my heart and there's just things in there. And so you'll see, I'll

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,720
 show you just a really short clip. You're going to see some kids who respond really well.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,420
 These are kids who have been trained. All of the kids that you see, they've sat down, they've

10
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,920
 gone through a program led by the police so that they know how to respond if they see a gun.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
 Some of them do well, some of them not so well. Watch this.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 There's like, we have a response to that. And, you know, so they hid the guns in the

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
 classroom and they of course remove the bullets and they wanted to see with the hidden

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
 cameras how the kids respond. And all of you frankly responded the same way that I did

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,280
 when I saw that kid turn the gun to his face and pull the trigger and pointed at his friend

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,680
 and pull the trigger. She's like, "Oh, ah!" Like there's just something like, "Oh!" And like,

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,320
 why is that so disastrous for us? Like, why is that so difficult to watch? And it's because

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,360
 we think about both the people who are handling the subject, right? There's their lack of

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,760
 awareness around it. And then secondly, so first of all, it's the people who are handling

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,040
 the subject. Secondly, the seriousness of the subject, right? The incredible wake of

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,840
 disaster that it could cause. And I show you that up front as we talk about this idea of

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
 the battle of the sexes. We're moving through this series and tonight we're talking about

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,160
 love and dating. I know, and I know because I can only imagine that you might have this

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,640
 response like, "Oh, come on, guns and love and dating? Come on." But here's the deal.

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:14,680
 I don't know that we understand both the seriousness of the subject and I don't know that we fully

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:22,000
 understand the wake of disaster that comes from it. We will. Like we will as we move

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,560
 through it. Some of you do. Some of you have experienced it very well. But I think for

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,600
 a lot of us, for whatever reason on this particular subject matter, like a dog to his vomit, we

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,880
 continue to run to that which has brought, has already brought incredible destruction

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 in our lives. And in fact, when I think about my past dating experience, I have a very similar

31
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:57,080
 response as I do when I watch that video. As I think about the wake of disaster that

32
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,680
 exists out there, girls who I have no idea where they're at, but I'm a part of their

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:10,480
 story. And because I'm a part of their story, right, they're going to be a little, potentially

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,240
 a less of a wife, right? A less of a mom. Because I'm a part, because I played a role

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,280
 in their story, right? Which means their kids are going to grow up different because mom

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,120
 was different. Why was mom different? Because she dated. And listen, I want to be really

37
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,640
 clear. Like I believe God heals. I believe God is sovereign. I believe He's huge. I believe

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,920
 He can make right. But I also don't want to stand up here and pretend like my sin didn't

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:46,160
 have consequences on others. I'm certain that it does today. I am certain that it does today,

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,240
 that there would be a legacy, potentially a wake of disaster behind those sins. And

41
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,360
 this is why I'm so unbelievably passionate about this subject. I try to attack it as

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,560
 logically as I possibly can just to present data, sheer facts to you. I just want to beg

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,560
 and plead with you tonight to open your mind. Open your mind and just consider what I'm

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
 saying as I present to you statistics and facts and scripture from the creator of the

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,360
 heavens and the earth, the creator of the universe, God. What He might have for you

46
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,880
 on this topic of love and dating because the reality of it is the success of your marriage

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,360
 will be determined by how you date for most of you in the room. And how you date will

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,400
 be determined by how you view dating. That's a fact. And so I want to help us with this

49
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,280
 reality of love and dating today and just the seriousness of it. And I want to tell

50
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,760
 you something. I am a dad with two little girls and a son. And my little girls are seven,

51
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,560
 are about to be seven and five. And I want you to know something. They don't play with

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,920
 guns. They don't. They play princess. Okay. They play house. It's cute. You know, Presley's

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,400
 the mom, Finley's the dad usually, which is weird, but maybe they need to come to the

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,720
 battle of the sexes. But anyways, so they, they play house. And, and so this is what

55
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,760
 they do. And here's the reality of that. It can be just as disastrous as playing with

56
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,040
 guns and you think, no, of course not. You can't, people can die. JP. Here's why. Because

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,720
 we never really grow out of that. Some of you are still here wanting to play princess.

58
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:45,960
 Some of you are still here hoping to get rescued. Some of you, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36 years old,

59
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,200
 39 years old, hoping that Prince Charming is going to come through or that some, some

60
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:59,480
 princess is going to lay down for you to get to play house with her. It's like we don't

61
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,040
 grow out of it. And so that's something that we've got to talk a lot about. I've got to

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,520
 talk a lot about with my little girls so that they would have a right view of that. Some

63
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,240
 of you have been playing princess your whole life, playing house your whole life, and we've

64
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,920
 never really outgrown it. And so tonight I want to talk about what is dating, what it

65
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,100
 looks like to redeem dating. And then as you leave here, before you leave, how do we identify

66
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,240
 love and dating? How can we identify love and dating? And so let's just start off with,

67
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,600
 number one, what is dating? Okay. What is dating? And so if we're going to define something

68
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
 and you're at the porch where we teach the Bible, we believe that it is God's living

69
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,880
 truth that the Bible can both tell us who God is, teach us about his character and give

70
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,480
 us instructions for life and what he desires for us. Where would we go in this book to

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,120
 cover dating? Where is dating in this book? It's nowhere in there. There's the answer

72
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,200
 to that trivia question. Genesis to Revelation, nowhere in this entire book is even an example

73
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,120
 of dating. Okay, us as pastors and preachers and teachers, we have tried to stretch us,

74
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,240
 you know, Ruth and Boaz, which is weird, and right? Jacob and Rachel and Leah, right? It's

75
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,040
 just a little strange, right? And so Isaac, Rebecca, these stories will kind of stretch

76
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 and put them over and try to teach dating from them. But the reality of it is, is it's

77
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,200
 nowhere in here. Why? And that's just an important fact in and of itself. Why is it not in there?

78
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:46,040
 Here's why. It's a very, very, very modern phenomenon. And that's important, right? Unless

79
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,920
 we understand history, unless we understand where something comes from, then we will certainly

80
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,920
 corrupt it and be taken advantage of by it. Dating is a very, very, that which might be

81
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,440
 ultimate in your life, that which might be the most important thing, that which might

82
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,160
 be the thing that you think more about than anything else, didn't even exist not very

83
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
 long ago. And so just before we go further, I thought it would just be fun to kind of

84
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,160
 go through the history of dating. And so I'll start in the year 1896. 1896, that's when

85
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,680
 the word actually enters our language. The word dating enters the English language. And

86
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,280
 do you know what it means? It means prostitution. Dating comes into the English language as

87
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,600
 a synonym with prostitution. Going on a date was a euphemism for paying for sex. If you

88
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,800
 said, "Hey, I'm going to go on a date," that meant that you were going to call on

89
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,360
 a prostitute. At this time in history, one-on-one between singles, one-on-one hanging out between

90
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,720
 people who are not married is highly discouraged by culture. So culture would say, "Hey, if

91
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
 you're a girl and you're a guy and you're single, you should not be hanging out one-on-one

92
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,080
 together." So for most of the world, for most of our existence as humanity, we did

93
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:08,080
 not do this idea of dating. And then in 1900, there's a sociology shift. And here's why,

94
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,640
 and this is important, because you insert media. You insert media. Now we see the birth

95
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,320
 of a woman's magazine, which begins to tell her how to dress and give her tips and tricks

96
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,240
 and techniques and what to expect and what to think. And it begins to tell her what is

97
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,920
 important. And so in the year 1900, there is one million subscribers to Ladies Home

98
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,880
 Journal, which began to influence women. And then in 1930, you see the invention of the

99
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,080
 automobile, which this was really, really important. This was another shift in dating.

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,520
 It took dating outside the home. What do I mean by that? Before the '30s, okay, before

101
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,040
 1930, dating happened in the living room. The father of the daughter would oversee everything

102
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,400
 the guy did. So he would, to date a girl, he would go into her house. He would ask her

103
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,520
 father if he could hang out, and they would hang out on the couch with dad right there.

104
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,360
 Yeah, that's what dating looked like up until this point. And so with the invention of the

105
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,600
 automobile, it pulls dating outside the home. And now in the '30s, what happens, and this

106
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,680
 is huge, this is huge, guys begin to offer a girl an experience. Do you see that? Hey,

107
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,680
 no longer are we going to sit on mom's sofa. Now I'm going to take you out, and I'm going

108
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,760
 to offer you an experience. And so what that meant, this was huge into the '40s, dating

109
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,400
 really exploded. Why? Because now the better the experience the guy could offer, the nicer

110
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:52,560
 the car, the prettier the girl. And before you think, "Oh, that's crazy. That's chauvinistic,"

111
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:00,480
 consider reality today, okay? This is still the phenomenon that our culture lives in today.

112
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,960
 And so here's what this looked like. It looks a lot like prostitution, you begin to understand,

113
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,880
 because it's like, "Hey, I will give you a nice experience in exchange for sexual favors."

114
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,000
 This still exists in much of America today. "Hey, let me take you out. Let me give you

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,560
 an incredible experience. We're going to make a memory together. And before the night is

116
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,960
 over, you might stay over, or we would get to do something fun and experience some sort

117
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,080
 of intimate moment together." So that our heart would race, and we would feel an emotion,

118
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,520
 a feeling, and we would be able to chase that thereafter, continuing to feel something better,

119
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,000
 more pleasure, whatever that is. And so in the 1960s, I'll just read this, "The new dating

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,640
 lifestyle society led way the greatest social upheaval in history of singleness in the Western

121
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,520
 world, the sexual revolution. This radically altered the sexual landscape of our nation.

122
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,240
 Sex is seen as an experience to be collectively shared, not restrained by stale religions."

123
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,880
 This is what it says. And then in the '60s, we see the sexual revolution, the great fault

124
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,240
 line of America, where it says, "Hey, you should do whatever feels good." We are still

125
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,900
 suffering the effects of the sexual revolution today. In the '70s, Playboy is born and placed

126
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,160
 into every convenience store in plain sight. And so if you want to access a naked female,

127
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,020
 you can do so at the 7-Eleven. In the '80s, the Internet is born. And so now that kind

128
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,480
 of is just an explosion of media influence into our lives. You can look at naked people.

129
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,660
 You can look at positions. You can study sex. You can become an addict of it without even

130
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,160
 having a partner. Okay? This is what happened in the '80s. In the '90s, there's just more

131
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,040
 of an explosion of this. But what happens now is Hollywood, specifically in 1990, Hollywood,

132
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,840
 through movies and music, begins to take sufficient -- I'm sorry, significant strides in pushing

133
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:51,660
 the previous boundaries and defining what this should look like for us. See, like a

134
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:59,920
 frog getting boiled in water slowly, we don't realize the external influences in our lives.

135
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,720
 And then in the 2000s, everyone has a mobile device in their pocket. You can access explicit

136
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,260
 pornography right here in church without leaving your seat. You can see every kind of sex act

137
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:17,000
 imaginable without moving. Right now, you have the inventions of smartphones, you know,

138
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,240
 massive scale. The pornography industry just explodes. Cohabitation is widespread and assumed.

139
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,480
 You have most people who live together before they're married. They think it's wise. It's

140
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,100
 not even that they're doing it and they're ashamed of it. They're saying, "You're stupid

141
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:37,640
 because you don't do it," which from a stance on logic is unbelievably ignorant. It is statistically

142
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,940
 very, very, very stupid to live with someone before you're married to them. A success rate

143
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:51,000
 of about 2%, okay? A success rate of about 2% of people who live together before they're

144
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,740
 married are then eventually happily married. Two percent, statistically ignorant. And so

145
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,280
 sex is seen as a necessary component of life and just a physical act. That's where we're

146
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,500
 at. That's the history of dating in a nutshell. And so let me ask you this question. Are we

147
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:17,420
 getting better at it? Is it getting better? Are we improving? And the reality, I see some

148
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,260
 of you shaking your head no. The reality is some of you here, you're like, "Yeah, getting

149
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,640
 better. Yes. Yes, because I got a nice car and I look good and I make money, which means

150
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,240
 lots of sex for me and I can have pleasure, right? And I got a smartphone in my pocket

151
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,960
 and I can access pornography and I can feed my flesh. Yes, we're getting better." Stay

152
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:45,160
 tuned. Let's keep reading. Let's make sure. Are we getting better? Are marriages better?

153
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,120
 Absolutely not. Look at divorce rates, right? I think we have a graph of that, of the staggering

154
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,040
 increase in divorce rate. When you see that dip right there, that could be a little bit

155
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,980
 deceiving because it actually represents less marriages, not less divorces. Percentage of

156
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:10,480
 divorce has stayed the same over a long length of time and have only gotten worse since the

157
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,160
 sexual revolution, an explosion of divorce. When you introduce the idea, "Do what feels

158
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,240
 good," you have people who no longer need to stay in a relationship. Half of you, this

159
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,160
 is going to happen to. How do you know it's not you? Like everybody knows it's not going

160
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,840
 to happen to me. I know it's already happened to a lot of you. I get that. Grace abounds.

161
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,320
 I'm so glad you're here. For the rest of you and for those that have happened, it's statistically

162
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,040
 very likely that it would happen to you again. I know you're like, "No, I'll never go through

163
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,400
 that again." Yeah, statistically you might. What are you going to do? How are you going

164
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,160
 to make sure it doesn't happen to you? I mean, do you have a plan? Are you dating with a

165
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,280
 plan? You've got to date with a ... You're going to make sure a divorce doesn't happen

166
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,760
 to you. You've got to have a plan, right? It's going to happen to half of you. I can

167
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,760
 literally draw a line right here. All of these divorced. All of you. All of you. You're like,

168
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,760
 "Why didn't you go that way?" What's up? He's like, "Go that way." I meant all of you divorced.

169
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,520
 That's what I meant. What are we going to do? What's our plan? What is dating? Dating

170
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,520
 is spending time with the opposite sex to determine if they are someone you should marry.

171
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,480
 That's what dating is. Let me give it to you again. Dating is like a no-dumb moment, right?

172
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,760
 It's not that obvious for some of you. Dating is spending time with the opposite sex to

173
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,720
 determine if they are someone you shouldn't marry. Not could marry because the reality

174
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,320
 of it is, and this is going to blow your mind a little bit, you really shouldn't go on a

175
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,040
 date with someone you couldn't marry. The reality of it is you should only go on dates

176
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,980
 with people that are in the realm of, "Hey, this is marriage material," which is actually

177
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,840
 very small. It's a small minority on this earth of people who yield to this book and

178
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,200
 live their lives according to God's instruction. Those are the only people who are available

179
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,080
 to you. I should say this. I'm only talking to Christ followers in the room. I realize

180
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,960
 that about half of you are not. We'll say this half. This half is not Christ followers.

181
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,800
 Those of you here that are following Jesus should only be on a date with other people

182
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,960
 who are following Jesus. That's the realm of the folks that you could marry. While you're

183
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,400
 on a date with someone that you could marry, you're now finding out, "Is this someone that

184
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,740
 I should marry? Is this someone that I enjoy spending time with? Does it seem like this

185
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:23,040
 is the person that I might continue to serve God with, continue to pursue God with? Is

186
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,920
 that what's going on here? Are they a person I should marry?" I'm not telling you that

187
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,360
 they are the one. There is no one for you. Let me say that really clearly because I know

188
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:41,000
 that always blows some people's minds. There is no one. Are we good there? God is sovereign.

189
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,120
 He knows everything. And there is no one. Mind blown. Let me hit this home for you like

190
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,760
 this. I'm married to my wife Monica. I love her very much. Am I the one for Monica? Is

191
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,920
 there a better one for Monica? When God created me November 9, 1980, did He also at some point

192
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,760
 shortly thereafter, March 9, 1981, create Monica and think, "Hey, I made her exactly

193
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,880
 to compliment JP so that they might find each other one." If He did, He has an incredible

194
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,360
 sense of humor because I'm 6'7" and she's 5'3". So I would just be like, "God, could

195
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,700
 have made me shorter or her taller or something." Let me hit you like this. There are people

196
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:32,720
 alive today better suited for Monica than me. She's the one because we walk down the

197
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:40,480
 aisle together. There are dozens, hundreds, potentially thousands of people that Monica

198
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:48,040
 could have had a very happy marriage with. But she and I got married. And so we became

199
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,920
 the one for each other in that moment. It's important to know that. Sometimes some people

200
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,960
 are just like, I'll get emails and I'll be like, "What? There's no one? That's crazy.

201
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:05,320
 We're looking for the unicorn and the one." And so I said that we only date believers.

202
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,720
 That's 2 Corinthians 6, 14, "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers for what do righteousness

203
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,320
 and wickedness have in common or what fellowship can light have with darkness." There's always

204
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,480
 someone that throws like a temper tantrum on this. I mean, I'll get like some email

205
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,560
 or some angry tweet that's like, "How dare you judge my boyfriend because he's an atheist?"

206
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,520
 And I'm just like, "Okay, man, stay tuned. Come see me in a little while. We'll meet

207
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,400
 up. We'll try to help you when that doesn't go well." It just doesn't go well. We don't

208
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,240
 missionary date. You guys follow? I'm not talking about sexual positions here. I'm saying

209
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,840
 we do not date people so that they would come into a relationship with Christ. That's not

210
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,620
 what we do. We do not missionary date.

211
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,080
 And so if that's the reality, if we're looking for a sold-out believer, and I'm looking,

212
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,920
 is actually looking for a spouse, what makes a good spouse? It's like if I'm supposed to

213
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,920
 spend time with them to identify if they have characteristics of a good spouse, what do

214
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,360
 I do? Right? Okay, first of all, you need a plan. You need to get help from others.

215
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,160
 You need, we call that here, that's community. Don't do it alone. If you're going to have

216
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,000
 a plan, if we're going to date intentionally, if we're going to go at this on purpose, then

217
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,560
 that looks inviting others to speak into it. It's Proverbs 15, 22. Let me talk to you about

218
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,560
 plans for a second. "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed."

219
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,520
 This is always confusing to me. I get these emails of people who want dating advice. "Hey

220
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,500
 man, here's the deal, the situation with my girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever, this is what's

221
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,960
 going on. We've been dating for like six years and I want to get married, but he blah, blah."

222
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,640
 So here's the deal. And when I say blah, blah, I mean that's incredibly interesting and I

223
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,640
 really want to help you. But my first response is this, "What does your community say?" Let

224
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 me ask you a better way. Why are you asking a stranger who does not know you or have any

225
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:06,300
 vision into the aspects of your relationship? And when you have other followers of Jesus

226
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:12,280
 around you who know you, "Well, I didn't really like their answer." "Hey, I'm sorry about that.

227
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,240
 You're not going to like mine either." Because I'm going to say, "Go back to them." What

228
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,040
 I'll say is I'll say, "Hey, would you just email me again and add them to the email so

229
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,800
 that we can all learn from each other?" Wisdom comes from the counsel of many. It says about

230
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,640
 16 times in the book of Wisdom, Proverbs. Wisdom comes from the counsel of many. Let

231
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,400
 me be abundantly clear. If you don't have Christ's followers, I'm happy to get that

232
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,400
 email. I truly am. Okay, and so I'm not trying to be condescending about that. But I am trying

233
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,700
 to hit on the importance of having other followers of Jesus in your life looking into your relationship

234
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,440
 and speaking wisdom into it. And I promise you, if they're doing that well, they will

235
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,360
 not always tell you what you want to hear. "Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but

236
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,120
 deceitful are the kisses of an enemy," the Proverbs says. So you have to have other people

237
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,040
 speaking into that. Another thing you can do. How do I know if there's someone I should

238
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,880
 spend the rest of my life with? Listen to how they talk. Okay, listen to how they talk.

239
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,760
 Listen to what comes out of their mouth. Is it gossip? Is it lies? Are they playing games?

240
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,960
 How do they talk? Do they use language that they shouldn't? Do they slander people? Are

241
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,640
 they constantly talking about things that they shouldn't? Why is this important? It's

242
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,560
 unbelievably important in dating. Here's why. Because Jesus says over and over throughout

243
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,960
 the Gospels, "Out of the mouth displays the heart. The mouth displays what's in the heart."

244
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,120
 What are you trying to do when you're dating them? You're trying to figure out what kind

245
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,360
 of heart they have. I'll show you Luke 6, verse 45. "A good man brings good things out

246
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,840
 of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil

247
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,560
 stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of." So watch what

248
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,400
 they talk about. The gossip about, lie about, cuss about, slander about, or the truth and

249
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,680
 the beauty that comes out of their mouth that they use for building others up. For the building

250
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,140
 up of others. Another thing you can observe is watch how they care for others. Not care

251
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,800
 for you because let's be honest, they like you. And so they're going to probably, and

252
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,080
 that's important too, if they're not good to you, that's easy, right? Okay, peace out.

253
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,040
 But it's not just about you, it's how they care for others. It's how they care for their

254
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,480
 neighbors. It's how they care for the kids in the nursery. It's how they care for the

255
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,760
 other people that they serve with. Other people in their teens. It's how they care for co-workers

256
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,800
 and employers and employees, right? How do they care for others? This is huge in the

257
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,520
 scripture, Mark 10. Jesus models this perfectly. The disciples are saying, "Hey, we want to

258
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,480
 be great. We want to be great." Jesus says, "Hey, everyone wants to be great, but not

259
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,720
 so with you." Verse 43. "Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your

260
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,880
 servant. And whoever wants to be first must be slaves of all." So you don't want to marry

261
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,560
 someone who's selfish or self-focused or narcissistic. Those people make awful spouses. I'm trying

262
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,800
 to spare you of this, okay? You want to marry someone who is other-centered. Someone who

263
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,960
 loves their neighbor as themselves, Jesus would say, right? They love their neighbors

264
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,920
 as themselves. Not someone who is stuck on themselves. Not someone who is constantly

265
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,880
 following their emotions or their feelings and just kind of doing whatever is the irresponsible

266
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,320
 thing in the moment. But someone who has a plan, right? See, people get divorced when

267
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,620
 they simply follow their feelings. Whoever you marry, should you marry, you're not going

268
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,600
 to feel like being married to them one day. And if you make a habit of following your

269
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,640
 feelings, you won't be married to them long. And so, so many of us, we jump into a relationship

270
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,160
 without a plan. This is crazy. Like, I know, and so I'm hitting you, and I'm trying to

271
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,840
 unlearn. We've got to unlearn some of this. Like, the reality of it is, is for most of

272
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,760
 the world in the existence of humanity, marriages have been arranged. And so, like, people come

273
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,200
 at me, "Well, yeah, but this is so important." I'm like, "Tell me that was important when

274
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,160
 people met at the altar." Okay? Like, mom and dad are there, and they're like, "Hey,

275
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,840
 meet your husband. Okay, now you're married, now go." The divorce rate was a whole lot

276
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,840
 lower. And if, I'm just, it's just logic. Just think about it. You can disagree with

277
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,840
 me. That's okay. Just leave here and think about it. See, what's happening is Hollywood

278
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,400
 and culture and Dallas is saying, "We're so good at this. You should listen to us." Here's

279
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,960
 the truth. They're not very good at it. They're not very good at it. They're going to be knocking

280
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,560
 on our door saying, "Will you please help me? I hate this man. I hate this woman. I

281
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:42,560
 never want to see him again. He's crazy. She's crazy." They're not very good at it. You've

282
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,760
 got to unlearn to relearn, right? God, the creator of the heavens and the earth, he's

283
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,960
 really, really, really, really, really good at it. And so, culture says, "Follow your

284
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,240
 heart." The Bible says, "Your heart is wicked and deceitful above all things and beyond

285
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,000
 cure." Jeremiah 17, 9, "The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can

286
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,240
 understand it?" Dallas says, "No, you should trust it. You should follow it. That's what

287
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,120
 you should do. Follow your heart." And so, what do we do about this? We're talking about

288
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,040
 dating. What do we do with it? We've got three options to understand it. We can reject it.

289
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,720
 We can go Joshua Harris on it. We can kiss it goodbye. We can say, "I don't want anything

290
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,440
 to do with dating." That only made sense to the devoted long-term Baptist in the room.

291
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,360
 So we can say, "Hey, I don't want anything to do with dating. I'm a Christian, so I won't

292
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 do it. It seems evil. It's not in the Bible. I'm not going to take part in it." We can

293
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 reject it, okay? Or we can accept it. And we can say, "What? You know what? I'm like

294
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,760
 Miley Cyrus and I can't stop. And I'm going to get after it. I'm going to find a dark

295
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,360
 horse like Katy Perry. I'm just going to run this race. This is how I'm going to roll.

296
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,240
 I'm just, you know what? I can't help it. The current of the culture is so strong. And

297
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,400
 JP, I think you're crazy." And you know, whatever. I'm just going to do whatever I want, whatever

298
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,720
 feels good. I'm going to accept it. And here's the third option, and this is the one that

299
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,720
 I want you to consider, okay? We can redeem it. We can take a cultural idea that hasn't

300
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,560
 been around very long. It's not a biblical idea, and we can breathe into it biblical

301
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,840
 truth so that we can redeem it. So the world can watch us do it, and the world can look

302
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,640
 at your marriage, should you have one, and say, "Man, I want it that way." They're singing

303
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,640
 Backstreet Boys to you, right? "I want it that way." This is what we want to do. We

304
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
 want to redeem it. So how can we redeem dating? That's my second point. How can we redeem

305
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,160
 dating? I'm just going to give you a few principles. By dating intentionally, number one, by dating

306
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,120
 intentionally. Okay, what this means is dating with a plan, dating on purpose, not just going

307
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,240
 out and saying, "Well, of course I'll go out with him because it's free coffee and that's

308
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,320
 fun. Of course I'll ask her out because it's just a fun way to spend a Friday night." But

309
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,000
 dating actually on purpose. So what does this look like? If you started early like I did,

310
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,360
 I started in the fifth grade, and so that just means you have to unlearn some of those

311
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,660
 things because there's no point in dating in the fifth grade. I'm not going to get married

312
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,360
 in the fifth grade, and we said that dating was for marriage. So if you don't want to

313
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,200
 be married, honestly you shouldn't be dating. That's the truth, and so I'm going to come

314
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,200
 back to that. But here's just some questions that I get. One is, how do I let a guy know

315
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,200
 I like him? Got that a lot. How do I let a guy know I like him? If I like a guy, right,

316
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,000
 girls just feel so powerless. And here's the truth. There's a God who created you, who

317
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,840
 has a plan for you, and He loves you. I don't even know that you have to let a guy know

318
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,000
 you like him. Okay? I think you can get, and I want you to stay with me, girls, before

319
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,520
 you get all angry and frustrated. I think you can serve that God who knows you and loves

320
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,520
 you and has a plan for you with all your heart. And I really think what He wired in us, now

321
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,560
 don't do it for this reason. This is always the risk because you turn it into a math equation.

322
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,160
 Like, people say, "Well, you should be in front of Him so He trips over you." And you're

323
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,320
 like, "All right, if He trips over me, then He'll marry me." Now don't do that, right?

324
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,120
 Here's what I want to say. You serve that God, and I think He's wired us as men to be

325
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,760
 attracted to that, particularly those of us who love Him. And so you serve Him so radically

326
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,000
 that we can't pursue Him without tripping over you. Right? You're running so hard after

327
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,840
 God. You're looking for God. Your entire life is following the trajectory of God. You're

328
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,560
 hoping and you're trusting in God. And as we decide that we want to serve God, too,

329
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,680
 you're everywhere that people who serve God are. I really think God wired us to love this

330
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,040
 idea. You see this in Rebekah in Genesis 24, right? Eleazar shows up looking for a wife

331
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,160
 for Isaac, and there she is. And she gives him water, and she gives his camels water,

332
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,120
 and she's just serving. And we see that, and so it's easy. "Well, if I want to get a guy,

333
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,800
 I should serve him." Right? But here's the reality. We don't know how many days, weeks,

334
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,840
 years she did that every single day, serving every single person who came through there.

335
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,280
 We don't know how long she was faithful. We don't have a vision into that, do we? And

336
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:18,800
 so you serve. You serve God. You change the entire trajectory of your life to pursue Him

337
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,600
 like crazy. And so guarding, we talk about guarding your heart. What can guarding your

338
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,880
 heart look like? Resisting the urge to control the situation. If you feel helpless, I get

339
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,480
 it. I mean, I probably don't understand it fully, but I've talked to enough girls to

340
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,840
 understand that there's just a feeling of helplessness there. It is an opportunity to

341
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,720
 trust God. And opportunities to trust God are good. They may not feel good, but I promise

342
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,760
 you they're good. And so if you're a guy, how do I let a girl know that I like her?

343
00:30:50,760 --> 00:31:01,320
 Okay, this one's a little more difficult. You use your words. All right? Did I say use

344
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,920
 your text message? Thank you. Did I say use your thumbs? No. Did I say use your Facebook

345
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,560
 and poker? No, that's weird. Don't do that. That's stupid, okay? Don't do that. Like,

346
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,480
 remember, JP said that on Tuesday night. Don't poke anyone on Facebook. Okay, here's the

347
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,960
 deal. You use your words. I just want to break that down. I want to get real practical with

348
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,160
 you. What does that look like? It looks like you getting up the courage because you trust

349
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:31,200
 in a God who is sovereign and who loves you and who controls all things, and you go to

350
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,800
 her and you look her in the eyes face to face, not even over the phone, just face to face.

351
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,160
 You say, "Ugh." And you get out the words. Somehow, someway, a miracle, you say, "Ugh,

352
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:51,640
 I really like spending time with you. Can we do that?" Right? You just do that. All

353
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,560
 right? That's what you do. And she may say yes, no, or maybe. But you use your words.

354
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,240
 This is real important. Okay, I've been asked to say this a few times, okay? So in case

355
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,440
 you missed it, you fell asleep, you just woke up, don't text. Don't text. Okay? Some of

356
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,200
 you guys are like, "What? That's crazy." I'm telling you, I love you guys. All right? My

357
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:21,360
 people, don't text. All right? Use the English language in the audible form. Face to face.

358
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,760
 You're a man. All right? You can do that. I promise you, it's good growth opportunities

359
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,080
 to use your words. And so that's how it looks like. This is how you let a girl know that

360
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,280
 you're interested. You say, "Hey, I'm interested in you. I'm interested in spending more time

361
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,560
 with you." And so men, what does leading look like in relationships? I got this question

362
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,240
 a lot. This is good. I really want to address this. So what does leading look like in a

363
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,080
 relationship? So you're not married, you're in a relationship. I think it can look like,

364
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,900
 you know, the modern culture would call it chivalry or kindness. The Bible would call

365
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,840
 it service, serving. So you might feel called by the scripture to be a leader. If you look

366
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,600
 at wherever verse you would use to be a leader, you're going to see the reality of the service

367
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,920
 behind it. Christ, husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the churches, Ephesians 5:25,

368
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,360
 that he gave himself up for her, that he served her to death. Okay? 1 Peter 3, 7. Husbands,

369
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,360
 live with your wives in an understanding way, treating them like something fragile and valuable.

370
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,940
 You see this idea. Wherever you see the idea of leading in the New Testament, you're really

371
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:37,160
 going to see the idea of serving. And so what does leading look like in a relationship?

372
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,080
 It looks like serving. It looks like being kind, being a gentleman, right? This is what

373
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,960
 it looks like. This is important, guys, okay? This is really important. What does leading

374
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,080
 look like in a relationship? It looks like never letting her wonder. Let her know where

375
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,160
 she stands, okay? For whatever reason, girls just wonder a lot. Their mind just wanders.

376
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,240
 And girls, you can work on this. Take your thoughts captive, okay? You can do that too.

377
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,720
 Guard your hearts. I'm just trying to love you right now. But guys, don't let her wonder.

378
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,880
 We talk a lot about leadership on my team and just in church. We talk a lot about leadership.

379
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,280
 Leadership, ready? This is how I define leadership. Leadership is removing confusion. Or I'll

380
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,400
 say a very important aspect of leadership is removing confusion. And so if you want

381
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,400
 to lead in a relationship, you remove confusion. You let her know what you're doing. Let her

382
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,120
 know what you were doing yesterday, why you did that thing that she thought was weird

383
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,400
 and wondered if you really wanted to break up because you did that. Just let her know,

384
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,640
 "No, I opened your door for you not because I wanted to break up, because I wanted you

385
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,880
 to get in the car." Okay? And so you just let her know what your intentions are. And

386
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,920
 "Hey, by the way, I really had fun tonight and I'd like to do this again sometime. Can

387
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,120
 we do this again tomorrow or Friday?" Right? You just be intentional. You don't have to

388
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:55,920
 be intense, but intentional. Okay? Nervous laughter on that one. And so you date intentionally.

389
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,160
 You remove the confusion. Right? Never let the girl wonder. And then this is the big

390
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,800
 one. It shouldn't be a big one, but for whatever reason it is, don't play games. This is what

391
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,760
 leading looks like. Listen, if leadership is removing confusion, games cause confusion.

392
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,640
 And so guys and girls, don't play games. What do I mean by game? Game is you doing something

393
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,000
 to get an emotional response. You can play a game with someone you don't even date. Right?

394
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,120
 You doing something to try to get a response from them. That's you playing a game. Whether

395
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,680
 that's call them or not call them. Whether that's hang up on them or say something. Like

396
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,840
 some of you, and this is really broken and really twisted and I don't get it, but some

397
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:41,280
 of you will actually start a fight just to feel loved. And that's broken, man. And I'm

398
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,400
 just saying like don't go into marriage with that. Like "Hey, I just need some attention

399
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,640
 so I'm going to pick a fight right now." It's really childish. Okay? And so don't play games.

400
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,200
 Verse 12, 9 just says this, "Love must be sincere." Love is sincere. It does not play

401
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,800
 games. And so another way that you can lead, and this is important, protect and preserve

402
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,560
 purity. Okay? Men, the way that you can lead in the relationship is protect and preserve

403
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,440
 purity. Every now and then I'll talk to a guy that's like, "Yeah, we're dating." I'm

404
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,800
 like, "Man, how's purity going?" He's like, "Man, it's going really well. You know, I've

405
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,240
 tried a few times to do something that was inappropriate, but she keeps me straight,

406
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,240
 so she keeps me straight." I'm just like, "What? Dude, she needs to break up with you,

407
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,360
 man. What is going on right now?" That's not her job to keep you straight. You want to

408
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:36,360
 know what leading looks like in a relationship? It looks like leading towards purity. Man,

409
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:44,200
 that's the reality. And so, that's frustrating.

410
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:50,240
 First Timothy 5, verses 1 and 2 says, "Treat younger men as brothers." And he's talking

411
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,280
 to the unmarried right now. And so it's, I always thought this verse wasn't very applicable

412
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,960
 upon studying. It's very applicable. "Older women as mothers and younger women as sisters

413
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,440
 with absolute purity." Why does it say, "As sisters with absolute purity"? It's telling

414
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,960
 you how you treat someone you are not married to. This is what it's saying. And so, women,

415
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,200
 what does it look like, what does submission look like in dating, right? Submission is

416
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,760
 that S word. What does that look like in dating? Here's what it looks like. You ready? Submission

417
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,880
 in dating looks like submission to Christ. Submission in dating looks like full and complete

418
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,440
 obedience and submission to Christ. And so, what does that mean? It can mean how you dress.

419
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,520
 All right? Like not following the trends of the world which show off your body, even though

420
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,440
 that might get a particular guy. It means submission to Christ in how you dress. First

421
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,360
 Timothy 2.9 says, "I also want the woman to dress modestly with decency and propriety."

422
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,320
 And then in 1 Peter 3.7, we see the same idea repeated. And he just says, "Your beauty should

423
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,520
 be that of your inner self with unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great

424
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,840
 worth in God's sight." Yeah, that's worth, yeah. That's sad only one person's excited

425
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,640
 about that. Okay? Here's the deal. Let me tell you this. It's just this simple reality.

426
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,360
 I'm just hitting you with logic. Logic from a dude. I'm just a dude and I'm just coming

427
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:18,440
 at you with logic. Okay? Think about bait. Whatever you want to catch, it determines

428
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,700
 the bait that you use. And so, if you want to use your boobs, you're going to catch a

429
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:29,120
 dumb bass. Okay? If you want to use your body, right, you're going to catch a dog. That's

430
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,080
 just the truth. And so, I had a girl tweet at me about a year ago and she just said,

431
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,400
 "Hey, let me..." We were covering dating and she said, "Hey, this is what I want you to

432
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,120
 talk about. Why don't you talk about why all guys are dogs? Why don't you talk about that?

433
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,800
 You know, help me understand why all guys are dogs." And so, here's her profile pic.

434
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,040
 She bended over, chin up, blouse hanging down, camera shot straight down the shirt, you know,

435
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,440
 boobs smashed together. And I'm like, "I know why you're getting dogs. I can help you with

436
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,440
 that. Okay? Stop using your body as bait because that body's going to fade and he's going to

437
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,040
 leave you and you're going to be hurting." And I've sat in that meeting far too many

438
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,040
 times. All right? "Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears

439
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,280
 the Lord is to be praised." So, be that. Okay? You don't have to take shortcuts. There's

440
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,800
 a God. He's in control of things. And if He never, ever gives you a husband, you die and

441
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:33,080
 go to heaven. When did heaven stop being good enough? It's like, "I want a husband and heaven."

442
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,600
 You don't even have a husband in heaven. It says we're not married in heaven. Right? Okay?

443
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,680
 You die and you go to heaven. It's going to be okay. All right? I hope he has a husband.

444
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,320
 If you want a husband, I hope he has a husband for you. If he doesn't, it's going to be just

445
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,480
 fine. All right? You won't explode when you hit 42 or whatever. Like, it won't just happen.

446
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,160
 Right? And so, just hang in there. Okay? Submission to Christ is being careful with your heart.

447
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,400
 And so, what do I mean by that? Let me just say like this. Nicholas Sparks and ABC have

448
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,720
 a vested interest in entertaining you. They do not have a vested interest in you having

449
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,400
 a healthy marriage. Okay? So, just be careful what you feed your heart. Because as you feed

450
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,800
 it stuff, it starts to want stuff. And it starts to want whatever you feed it. So, just

451
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,480
 be careful what you put in there. Okay? Don't feed your heart. Don't just feed your heart

452
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,080
 trash. And don't follow your heart. You inform your heart. You begin to tell your heart where

453
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,200
 to go and what to pursue and what to run after. Proverbs 423 says, "Above all else, guard

454
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,960
 your heart, for everything you do flows from it." And so, ladies, this is what I want to

455
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,960
 say. God wired you to give love. He did. He made you that way. It's a part of His wiring,

456
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,360
 your unique wiring, your unique just existence, the way God made you female, is He made you

457
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,000
 to give love. But here's the honest truth, and some of the guys are going to hate me

458
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,680
 for this, and I'm really okay with that. But God will exploit that in you. Okay? We will

459
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:03,280
 learn if you let us how to exploit your wiring to give love so that we can get what we want

460
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,360
 from you. And so, just be careful. Song of Solomon is repeated throughout. But in chapter

461
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:15,160
 3, verse 5, it says, "Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires." Other translations

462
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,160
 say, "Do not awaken love before it's time." It says it over and over throughout the Scripture.

463
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,000
 And so, just be careful. And so, you submit to your husbands, ladies, as He submits to

464
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Christ, but until then, you just submit to Christ. Do you follow me on that? Submit to

465
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,320
 your husbands as He submits to Christ, but until you have a husband who's submitted to

466
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,200
 Christ, you just submit to Christ. That's what submission looks like. And so, lastly,

467
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,880
 I would tell you that dating intentionally, or not lastly, but I'll just say, dating intentionally

468
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,240
 looks like dating with purity. What does redeeming dating look like? It looks like dating with

469
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,120
 purity. This is not simply not having sex. Sex serves a purpose. God created sex. Sex

470
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,240
 was designed. So, I'm just coming at you with logic, so stay with me. Stay with me. I want

471
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,320
 you to take this. I want you to repeat it. Sex. God made sex, and sex is good. It's a

472
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,200
 great gift from God. If you never have it, you're going to be okay. But if you do get

473
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,160
 to enjoy it in a marriage, it's a wonderful thing, and it serves a really interesting

474
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,080
 purpose. Just consider this. You have reproductive organs. And those reproductive organs, they

475
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:24,040
 work together in sex to produce a human. And so, what we do as singles is we try to have

476
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:30,800
 sex and prevent birth. That's what we do. We try to capture that pleasure without what

477
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,400
 we view as a consequence, which is really a gift from God. It's the way he wired us.

478
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,360
 That's why God wired us to only have sex in marriage. It's just a simple design idea.

479
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,560
 And so, what we begin to do, and stay with me, we begin to capture the pleasure without

480
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:51,360
 the purpose, but we don't realize that the pleasure serves a purpose. Do you hear me?

481
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,440
 We capture the pleasure without the purpose, not realizing that the pleasure serves a purpose.

482
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,480
 What the pleasure does is it actually bonds a husband to his wife. What that means is

483
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,280
 when your body physiologically is built that when you experience an orgasm, you would bond

484
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,080
 to whatever is around you, that that person would become the epitome of attraction to

485
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:17,160
 you through a brain synapse that is produced in the event of orgasm. The pleasure you experience

486
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,400
 serves a purpose to bond you to another human being. That's why in the Hebrew, the word

487
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:28,160
 for sex is actually two becoming one. This is God's design. Science has now proven it.

488
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,080
 Psychiatry has now proven this idea that I'm hitting you with. So, what happens when you

489
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,160
 begin to have sex outside of marriage is you teach your body not to bond. You begin to

490
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:45,440
 rewire your body. This is the extreme dangers of pornography. So, if that's your struggle,

491
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,480
 go listen online to a message I did called Looks That Kill. But this is the extreme dangers

492
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,280
 of pornography. You are rewiring your brain in the way that it's supposed to work to bond

493
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:03,640
 to one human being for a lifetime. And so, here's why I would tell you that being with

494
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,680
 someone, like if someone is willing to have sex with you before marriage, they're communicating

495
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,400
 something really clearly to you. They're saying, "Hey, I follow my desires." And particularly

496
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,960
 if they claim to be a Christian, they're saying, "Hey, I know this is not God's best, but I've

497
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,080
 justified it somehow, some way, so that I can follow my desire in this moment." And

498
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,720
 what they're telling you, they're saying, "Hey, I will always follow my desire. I will

499
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,040
 not fight. I will not fight my desire. I will follow my flesh." They are telling you this,

500
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,280
 "I'm an adulterer. And you marry me, someone hotter than you is going to come along, and

501
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,840
 I'm communicating to you right now that I'm going to pursue pleasure over you." Do you

502
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:48,680
 see that? They're saying, "Hey, I am not willing to stand against these sexual urges in this

503
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,080
 moment. It's too tempting. And so, should you want to spend the rest of your life with

504
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:59,880
 me, you need to know one fact about me. That is that I follow my sexual urges in a moment.

505
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,440
 You're marrying me knowing that. So, when I have adultery, you cannot fault me. When

506
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,720
 I cheat on you, do not fault me. I've told you that ahead of time. You guys following

507
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,280
 me?" When I heard this, it blew my mind. I'm like, "That's exactly what it is." I get that.

508
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:24,080
 You're saying, "Hey, I will not suppress these desires. They're too strong. And so, when

509
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:29,280
 they come back up later, I will follow them then, too." And this is why you have a huge

510
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,280
 spike in adultery in marriages right now. This is why you have a huge spike in divorce

511
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:43,560
 since the sexual revolution. It's just science, y'all. Okay? It's just the studies of humans,

512
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,640
 the way our brains work. It's simple. And the way that God designed us, when we go against

513
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:57,840
 that, what happens, it's important. And so, lastly, you date towards something. What does

514
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,480
 redeeming dating look like? It looks like you date towards something. And so, if you

515
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:09,040
 don't want to get married, I already said it, don't date, right? Like, I know the world

516
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,960
 says, "Hey, you can date casually. You can experience pleasure casually." Or it says

517
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,920
 this other idea. It's like, "Hey, date for years." Like, some of you, I've been engaged

518
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,520
 for four years. I'm like, "That's stupid. You can't even have sex, right? I mean, this

519
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,120
 is crazy. Don't do that. Like, get married." The only reason that a guy would want to be

520
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,920
 engaged to you for that long, right, is he's saying, "Hey, I want to wait. I just want

521
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,480
 to make sure something better is not going to come along." That's it. That's it. Listen,

522
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,720
 I'm the bad guy. That's okay. I don't mind being the bad guy. I'm the truth teller. That's

523
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,920
 what I am, okay? The only reason that a dude wants to stay with you for six years with

524
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,360
 a ring on your finger, "Man, I just want to make sure," all right? And that we weren't--you

525
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,520
 were wired to get married. You weren't wired to date, frankly. God didn't create you so

526
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,720
 that you could exist in a relationship for a long time without being able to give yourself

527
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,760
 to each other. You weren't made that way. It's 1 Corinthians 7, "Better to marry than

528
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,780
 to burn with passion." You were made, you were created to meet someone who is fully

529
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,000
 committed to Christ so that you could come together and be married and have sex for a

530
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,440
 lifetime. And that event was meant to be much faster than it exists today. Am I telling

531
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,880
 you to rush into marriage foolishly? No, I'm telling you to make sure that you have all

532
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,040
 those other things in place, that they're following Jesus, that community has approved.

533
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:33,400
 But once those are in place, man, go! Off to the races for you, okay? And so, date towards

534
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,120
 something. See, we all want a fairy tale pic. I'm sorry, we all want a fairy tale. I'm going

535
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:47,760
 to show you a picture. I read that off my island. So, we all want a fairy tale. Let

536
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,920
 me show you what I came home to yesterday, okay? I walk, I pull up in my driveway and

537
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,880
 I'm walking to the sidewalk and then my little girl meets me. I think you guys, yeah, there

538
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,200
 she is. That's Presley. So, she's dressed like Frozen, if you know that reference. And

539
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,100
 so, she dresses up like a princess. This is what happens when you're in the first grade.

540
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,000
 You go to school, you come home, you take off all your clothes and you put on a princess

541
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 gown every single day. That's what we do, okay? And so, she dresses up like a princess.

542
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,600
 And Disney has done an incredible job of letting her know that there's a prince charming out

543
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:26,160
 there that wants to come and rescue her. And when we watch that, Nicholas Sparks, notebook,

544
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,880
 whatever, like we're just moved with emotion and we're like, "I want it that way." Like,

545
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,480
 we want those things, right? We're like, "That's what I want. I want the fairy tale." And it's

546
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,840
 the same. I don't know if you've noticed this, it's the same story over and over. The Frozen

547
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,800
 or Cinderella or Snow White, right? There's evil, there's good, there's a prince charming,

548
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,720
 a rescuer comes in, there's a dance on distress, right? Over, same story, over and over. Whether

549
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,200
 it's Braveheart, if you're a guy, maybe you know that reference. Same story, over and

550
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,680
 over and over and over again. Why does our heart go after this? Because you were made

551
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:10,840
 to love. And you were made to be loved. And I've got to tell you something really important.

552
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:18,280
 You're loved right now. Not when you have a man. Not when you have a woman. You're loved

553
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,000
 by an amazing God right now. So my last point is how do we identify love and dating? I'll

554
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,720
 try to do this quickly. I know we're over. How do you, this is just a simple, how do

555
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,080
 you know if they're the one, right? Are they someone you desire to serve with your entire

556
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:36,160
 life? That's it. How do I know if they're the one? You look at them and you say, "Will

557
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,200
 I serve this person my entire life? Am I willing to serve this person, my men and women, am

558
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:49,280
 I willing to serve this person my entire life? When she is ugly and, you know, crazy, am

559
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,840
 I willing to serve this person? When he is ugly and unemployed and whatever, am I willing

560
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,840
 to serve this person my entire life?" And as soon as you can commit to that, assuming

561
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:07,440
 they're madly in love with Jesus, you get married. And so love is a decision accompanied

562
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,340
 by an emotion that leads to a commitment. Love is a decision accompanied by an emotion

563
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,240
 that leads to a commitment. So many of us, we date because we want to feel love, not

564
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:22,320
 give love. We date because we want to feel loved, not actually give love. And so what

565
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,500
 I'm doing tonight is I'm not trying to lower your view of dating. I want to raise your

566
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:32,320
 view of marriage. Marriage is the only metaphor in the Scripture that talks about Christ in

567
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,720
 the church. It is not ultimate. Let me just say this. You never get married if you call

568
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,080
 the singleness. If you're here and you're like, "I'm called to singleness." Great. You

569
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,440
 don't need a date and just pursue God with your entire life. I hope some of you are.

570
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,680
 It's very biblical to be called to singleness. It's not biblical to be called to singleness

571
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,320
 and to date. Okay? Should you date, you date for marriage. And so now I'm talking to the

572
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,960
 rest of you who desire to be married. Married is a good thing. It is a metaphor. Todd talked

573
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:02,040
 about last week between Christ and the church. But it is so much more than that. It is this

574
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:09,040
 thing that God created. It is a gift to us. It serves a purpose in procreation. But have

575
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,680
 you ever heard about the Jewish wedding tradition and how that worked? I want to tell you that.

576
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,280
 I want to end with this. Just this idea that fathers, right? The father of a son and the

577
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:28,320
 father of an unmarried daughter would come together. The father of the son would go into

578
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:35,520
 a foreign land and find a wife for his son and would make an agreement with that father.

579
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,000
 And then the son would leave his home, his father's home, and go into that foreign land.

580
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,440
 Stay with me now. This is history. This is how this happened for a long, long time. He

581
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,440
 would go into that land and he would bring with him a dowry, a price that was to be paid

582
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,560
 for her. And he would go to her father and he would purchase her. Or he would purchase

583
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:04,880
 the right to be trothed to her, which is engaged to her. Okay? They would meet and they would

584
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,680
 toast. They would drink wine from the same glass. And from that moment on, they belonged

585
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:17,480
 to each other. He would leave. For over a year, for over 12 months, the Jewish boy would

586
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:23,400
 leave and go back to his father's house, back to his homeland. And what he would do is he

587
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:30,680
 would begin to build a house for them. Not just any house, a room on his father's house

588
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,680
 called the bridal chamber. He would begin to add to his father's house this room called

589
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,400
 the bridal chamber. He would work on it. What was he doing for that entire 12 months? Was

590
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,520
 he playing PlayStation? No. He was building. Was he looking at porn? No. He was building

591
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,520
 their house. Was he at the strip club? No. He was building their house. His entire life

592
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:59,600
 was distracted by preparing a place for her. What's she doing? Here's why. She didn't know

593
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,760
 the hour or the time that he was going to come back. She knew that it would be over

594
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,760
 a year, but it's not like he says, "Hey, on March 3rd, I'm going to..." No, no. She doesn't

595
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:15,160
 know. And so she just waits. Does she wait with a dude? No. No, no, no. No, she waits

596
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,120
 and she begins to make her wedding dress and she begins to get together her bridal party.

597
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,400
 These are traditions that we still use today. They were created in the Hebrew tradition,

598
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,040
 in the Jewish tradition. She would get together her bridal party and she would get together

599
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,680
 her wedding dress over that 12 months and she would wait. And when the time would come,

600
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,840
 when the house was finished, check this out, he would leave and he would go for her. And

601
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,320
 he would take with him his groomsmen and they would go before him with musical instruments,

602
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,640
 trumpets, musical instruments. And it was a party. They would go before him from city

603
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,040
 to city as he traveled back to her place, this foreign land where she's from. "He's

604
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:00,640
 coming for you. He's coming to get you. He's coming to take you home with him." And this

605
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,320
 message would go out before them and it would reach her. "He's coming. He's coming. Grab

606
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:11,400
 my dress and put it on. You girls, you ready? Come on." And then she would get ready and

607
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:18,560
 he would come. That was my Shane and Shane voice. He would come. He would come. He would

608
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,520
 come for her and she would be veiled. She would be veiled. It's beautiful. This happened

609
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:30,280
 for thousands of years. She'd be veiled and he would take her to his parents' house and

610
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,040
 they would travel back. And when they got back to his father's house, there was a party.

611
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:42,640
 A party. They walked into a party and they had a wedding ceremony where they became husband

612
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,000
 and wife. And then check this out. Here's the explicit details. They would go into the

613
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,200
 bridal chamber and they would make love for seven days. Could you imagine how awkward

614
00:54:52,200 --> 00:55:03,240
 that is? You come out. Her hair is all crazy, you know. So they would make love for seven

615
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,840
 days. They'd consummate the marriage. And there was a party outside for seven days.

616
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:15,800
 It didn't stop. That's a wedding, man. That's a wedding. Okay. And then he would present

617
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:25,240
 her to her, to his family as pure and his. All right. Here's why that is so unbelievably

618
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:30,840
 important and why I would tell you right now you are already in a fairy tale, whether you

619
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,840
 know it or not. In Matthew 26, the last thing that Jesus does before he dies, he takes the

620
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,880
 cup and then he had given thanks. He gave it to them saying, drink from it. All of you.

621
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,840
 This is my blood of the covenant, the covenant, the covenant, which is poured out for many

622
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,720
 of the forgiveness of sins. And then they say, but Jesus, where are you going? Where

623
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,240
 are you going? He says, I'm going to my father's house. I'm going to prepare a room for you

624
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,640
 in John 14 verse two. He says, my father's house has many rooms. If it were not so, I

625
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,320
 would have told you that I am not going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and

626
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,360
 I prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may

627
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,560
 be where I am. And then revelation 19, we see this incredible picture where the groom

628
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:19,000
 comes from the foreign land or comes into the foreign land to take us back with him,

629
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,960
 us male and female as his bride. And you know what? We do not know the hour or the time

630
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,760
 of when that's going to come, but the scripture tells us it will happen with noise and music

631
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,480
 and trumpet blasts of his people, of his angels. And then he takes us into the place. The church

632
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:42,200
 is hidden for seven years and presented pure and holy. Some believe to God, the father,

633
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:48,540
 the creator of the heavens, the earth. This is the story that you are a part of. And so

634
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:53,520
 you wonder, man, how do I date and why is marriage important? This was created into

635
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,620
 our, our creation, our earth, our universe. God made this and wired it in. He stepped

636
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,620
 into the story in Jesus. And so culture says, Hey, I'm going to redefine marriage. You can't

637
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:14,200
 get it. God's it's God's. He made it. It's his, it belongs to him. And it's so much more

638
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,720
 than a white picket fence, a German shepherd and two kids. It's a metaphor for the way

639
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:29,720
 that he loves you. Not when you get married right now. And so if you're married, follow

640
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,560
 him, serve him. If you want to be married, serve him. If you're single, serve him. If

641
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,520
 you want to be single, serve him. What's your role? You're going to die soon, man. You're

642
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,600
 going to die soon. You're going to be with God forever and ever and ever. It's going

643
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,400
 to be incredible. Like a honeymoon, the scripture says. That's where we get the seven day honeymoon,

644
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,760
 by the way. It comes from that tradition. That's where we get the toast at the marriage,

645
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,440
 at the wedding, by the way. It comes from that tradition. That's where it comes from.

646
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:03,860
 He loves you selflessly. And so why does your heart move when you see someone be loved selflessly?

647
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,640
 It's because it's the way God loves you. I want to show you something. I just, I want

648
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:15,680
 to show you what love is. Okay. Will you just watch this with me? We'll end with this. Why

649
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:23,680
 does your heart move when you see someone give their life for others? It's because the

650
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,960
 Lord God, creator of the heavens and the earth, wants you to know that he gave his life for

651
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:37,200
 you. Came into a foreign land to rescue you and committed to you that he's coming back

652
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:44,560
 for you. And that's why you're alive, man. It's not to look cute or to get married or

653
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:51,360
 to feel good. It's to live for him. I'm going to do a wedding on Saturday between my friends,

654
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:58,600
 Kyle and Leah. They've just done such an incredible job, such an incredible job of pursuing God

655
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,920
 together and honoring him and their relationship. And Monica and I've been meeting with them

656
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,160
 for several weeks and here's what's going to happen. I've done enough weddings to know

657
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,640
 how this is going to happen. Kyle's going to stand there right beside me. I'll be here.

658
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:15,440
 He'll be there in the chapel. The doors are going to be shut and music's going to be playing

659
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,640
 and he's going to be watching those doors, just waiting for them to open so that he can

660
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:26,240
 see the one he's spent the rest of his life with, the one he waited for since he was a

661
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:33,640
 boy so he can see her. The doors are going to swing open and he's going to smile and

662
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:40,520
 it's all going to become foggy because he's going to cry. And that waiting, that moment,

663
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,880
 I always watch the groom. That's the moment you and I are in. We're waiting. We're anticipating

664
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,640
 Jesus' return. It could happen any minute. I hope it happens right now. Might happen

665
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,200
 tonight, tomorrow. He's going to come back for us to take us home with him.

666
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:58,700
 Amen.

667
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:09,700
 [silence]
