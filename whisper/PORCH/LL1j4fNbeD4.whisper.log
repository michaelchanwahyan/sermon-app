[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (eerie music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:17.600]   - I love it, how about that?
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.360]   Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.680]   in Houston, and El Paso, and Cedar Rapids,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.240]   and wherever you are joining us from
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   as we continue this series, The Afterlife,
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.240]   a look at what is beyond the grave, or after death.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.640]   Anyone a big fan of the beach in here?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.200]   Yeah, or Mexico, or Cancun, any Cancun fans?
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.400]   So when I got engaged to my now wife
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.000]   about five and a half years ago,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.920]   six years ago, I was essentially assigned one thing.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.360]   So this is just a little free tip here,
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.720]   men, whenever you get engaged,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.960]   you're essentially given one thing,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.680]   or at least I was only entrusted with one responsibility,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.200]   and hey, you can't mess this up, so go get after it.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.920]   She'll cover the flowers, everything else,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.440]   you just cover this, and it was the honeymoon.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.040]   And so I am tasked with getting the honeymoon,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.940]   and I'm not gonna let my soon-to-be bride down,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.740]   so I'm gonna find the best place in the entire world
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440]   we're gonna go to, it's gonna be amazing,
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.960]   it's gonna be, you know, whatever honeymoon spot
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.600]   is the best one available, we're gonna go there.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.620]   I had been given some advice at this time in my life
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.240]   that I'm not sure is good advice,
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.360]   or definitely not biblical, but it was this.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.480]   It was hey, there's two things in life
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.880]   you can't spend too much money on,
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.640]   an engagement ring, 'cause she's gonna have it,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.080]   hopefully forever, and the honeymoon.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.840]   And so I was like, man, I'm all in on that, okay.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.680]   So I essentially go, I'm gonna break the bank.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.200]   I invest, I find the best place,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.040]   it was this place called the Paradise of Beauty,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.240]   Pariso de la Bonita, I know, habla Espanol.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   And I researched it, it was like really secluded,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.880]   you had your own maid, you had 1,250 square feet,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.080]   was each size of each room,
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.000]   you had your own private plunge pool,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.640]   you had two flat screens, not one, but two flat screens
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   inside of your hotel room, I mean, it was like to the nines.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.480]   Every morning at breakfast, there'd be somebody out there
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.480]   with like literally a huge golden harp
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   just playing music for you as you sit in paradise
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.320]   and you're enjoying it.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.880]   There was this gourmet chef that was a part of it,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.280]   it was a gourmet all-inclusive of what it was called.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.680]   I mean, it was like, dude, we are never ever gonna be able
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.920]   to come back here, but it's gonna be amazing
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.760]   when we're there.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.760]   So the wedding week comes, we get through the wedding,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.680]   Saturday night we got married, on a Saturday night
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.520]   we were gonna leave Monday morning
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.320]   so that we didn't have to get up early next morning
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.480]   and go on an airplane ride and get out of there.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.580]   And so the wedding comes, everything goes great,
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.520]   wedding night goes great, and then Sunday,
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.840]   we're waiting to leave the next day,
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.820]   and around late afternoon, I begin to experience something
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.200]   that's gonna sound just bizarre to you,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.880]   but I began to have the closest thing I know
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.980]   how to describe it would be like almost a panic attack
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980]   about what are we gonna do at Pariso de la Bonita?
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.440]   I have no idea, I barely even know this woman,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.880]   I'm about to go spend eight days with her,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.200]   we're going to a foreign country, it's like secluded,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.800]   it's like you just lay around and relax.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.200]   I like, when I, vacation, I wanna like go
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.600]   and go see things and excursion,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.280]   and I begin, I know that sounds crazy and bizarre,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.840]   but I'm like, oh my gosh, what are we gonna do there
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.220]   for eight days?
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.840]   And I know what you're thinking, it's your honeymoon,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.040]   I know what you're gonna do.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.560]   After 10 minutes of that, you're like,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.640]   what are we gonna do for the rest of the time on this time?
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.920]   And so I'm like, this is legitimate for you,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.840]   you're like, this is, I know, all right, back with me.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120]   It's true, anyways.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.400]   Anyways, I'm wondering like, legitimately,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.960]   I'm like starting to freak out, I'm like,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.360]   it was a low moment, for real.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.560]   My poor wife at the time, as I'm like,
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   I begin to like get choked up, I'm like, I don't know,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.380]   I just don't know what we're gonna do
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.680]   in the paradise of beauty.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.500]   I mean, we're just gonna lay around for eight days,
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.680]   that sounds terrible.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.640]   I'm gonna be bored out of my mind.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.600]   True story, go to Barnes & Noble, get like 12 books,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.440]   I'm like, I'm gonna make this an educational trip,
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.520]   we have to, because I have no idea what are we gonna do.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.800]   We chose this like boutique, tiny hotel.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.840]   Oh man, I'm gonna be bored out of my mind
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.460]   in paradise of beauty.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.080]   And truly, I began to like think through like,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.300]   man, maybe we should stay here in Dallas.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.600]   You know, there's some cool hotels around here,
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.200]   maybe we get out of this.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.640]   And it sounds funny, but it's true.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.880]   I was like, really like, oh man, what are we gonna do?
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.680]   And I say all of that, because in a very similar
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.320]   parallel way, that I was afraid or I was concerned about,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.620]   man, paradise, everyone says it's paradise of beauty,
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.860]   it's amazing, incredible reviews, supposed to be awesome,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.800]   it's your honeymoon week, supposed to be incredible,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.120]   and yet I have no idea what we're gonna do.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.640]   I'm like, I'm not even sure I wanna go
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   and be a part of that.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.440]   In a very similar way that that paradise
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.600]   was not something I wanted to go to.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   I think today, a lot of us experience something similar
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.600]   as it relates to heaven.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.040]   Like, it's kind of this place where everyone says
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.440]   it's amazing, it's gonna be great someday,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.940]   and yet if we were honest and heart of hearts,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.600]   we're kind of like, I don't know, I wanna go
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.080]   when I die someday, 'cause I don't wanna go to hell,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.920]   and so if I'm between those two options,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.640]   I wanna go someday, but I don't know that I wanna go today,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.080]   and I don't know that I wanna rush through,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.300]   you know, I don't wanna miss out on not getting married,
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.880]   or I wanna get married someday, or I wanna have kids first,
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.160]   and heaven sounds like some place that I kinda wanna go,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.820]   I'm just not sure what we're going to do.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.940]   I mean, forever is a long time.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.960]   What are we gonna do up there?
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.080]   And then you have people saying things like,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.980]   hey, you're gonna be on a cloud,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.560]   you're gonna be playing a harp, you're like,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.400]   I think I'd rather stay in Dallas,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.240]   if that's where we're gonna be.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.600]   I mean, that doesn't sound, or other people say,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.440]   it's like, hey, it's like one big worship service,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.160]   church service, and maybe you're like,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.960]   I don't like music, so you're like, let's review again.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.940]   What are the two options?
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.600]   Hell, let's go through that one more time,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.680]   or the church service forever?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.340]   Ah, and it just doesn't sound that great.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.440]   And I think the truth of the reality is,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.140]   if we understood what awaits us in eternity,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.480]   what awaits us in heaven, or in paradise,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.120]   it would be something that we couldn't wait to get there.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.640]   Truly, I think one of the reasons the Bible
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.720]   is a little bit cryptic in the way that it describes it
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.280]   in kinda like allegory and metaphor,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.340]   is because if we truly understood all that awaited us
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.680]   in the pleasure ahead of us,
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.260]   of just the, what it would be like there,
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.340]   the suicide rate might increase.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.980]   'Cause people are like, man, I just wanna get outta here,
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.560]   I can't wait to be there.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.060]   And so tonight, we're gonna talk about heaven,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.740]   because it is anything but boring.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.740]   It is anything but a place that you don't wanna go to,
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.880]   and we're gonna discover exactly, from God's word,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.340]   what heaven is like.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.020]   It's not one long church service, spoiler alert,
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.540]   you're not on a cloud with a harp, wearing a diaper.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.460]   You are gonna experience
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.260]   what this world is always intended to be.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.100]   So we're gonna be in Revelation chapter 21 and 22,
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.800]   as we explore what heaven, or what paradise, will be like.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.480]   Revelation 21 and 22, we're gonna look at what heaven is like
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.160]   and what it's not, based on the passage
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   that we're looking at.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.240]   Who will be in heaven, or who will be
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.420]   in this eternal paradise?
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.420]   And finally, once and for all, what are we gonna do
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.540]   in heaven, forever and ever and ever?
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.300]   So Revelation chapter 21, Revelation is the only
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.460]   prophetic book inside of the New Testament.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.300]   What do I mean by prophecy?
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.940]   It's basically like, hey, we're looking at the future.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.580]   And it was a book that was written by the apostle John,
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.740]   one of Jesus' best friends, and John basically outlived
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.060]   all the other disciples.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.260]   The other guys had either gotten killed for their faith,
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.500]   or had gone off and had lost their life as a missionary,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.660]   and John, as an old man, is exiled by the Roman Empire
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.020]   to this island called Patmos.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.340]   Basically, they're like, hey, you gotta go sit
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.180]   in time out, John, for the rest of your life.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.620]   And so John is out there, and while he's there,
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.780]   God essentially gives him this vision
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.980]   of what heaven is gonna be like.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.500]   And it says, man, I want you to write this stuff down.
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.620]   And this is what the future ages of the church
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.220]   are gonna go through, that's the Revelation.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.220]   And then he goes in, and this is what heaven,
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.420]   one day, is gonna be like.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.900]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse one of chapter 21,
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.740]   as John describes what he saw.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.980]   John speaking.
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.180]   Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.300]   For the first heaven and the first earth,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.460]   that's this one, had passed away,
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.060]   and there was no longer any sea.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.820]   That he sees this new heaven and this new earth.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.580]   And he says there's no sea on the earth.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.420]   What does that mean?
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.620]   The sea in today's day on our planet right now
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.980]   is 97% of the water on planet Earth is undrinkable.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.900]   Did you know that?
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.660]   There's too much salt in it, or it's not clean enough.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.220]   In other words, it provides one purpose
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.820]   and one purpose alone.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.780]   Or the primary thing it does is divide people.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.780]   It separates us.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.540]   And he says in this new heavens and this new earth,
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.740]   there's no sea, it's like there's no division among man.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.900]   And he says this.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.340]   And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.420]   coming down out of heaven from God,
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.220]   prepared as a bride, beautifully dressed
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.580]   for her husband.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.780]   And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.780]   look, God's dwelling place is now among the people.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.840]   He will dwell with them.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.380]   God will dwell with mankind, and they will be his people.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.140]   And God himself will be with them and be their God.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.420]   And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain,
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.660]   for the old order of things has passed away.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.820]   He who is seated on the throne says,
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.320]   I'm making everything new.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.620]   Then he said, write this down,
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.280]   for these words are faithful and true.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.940]   A first idea I wanna talk about is what is heaven like?
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.300]   And we're told, some indication,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.360]   heaven is this earth made new.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.740]   It's a new heavens and a new earth.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.440]   It is like earth 2.0.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.780]   So in other words, if you have this idea
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.660]   of what heaven is like 'cause you're kind of floating around
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.080]   and the clouds up there and someday, you're off.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.340]   The Bible teaches that what we're gonna experience
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.100]   is this earth that we're on resurrected or made new.
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.300]   This earth, but only in 2.0 version.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.180]   Everything wrong with this earth, restored, made right,
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.300]   everything broken, fixed, and put back together
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.000]   that as God originally intended and designed it
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.820]   at the very beginning in the Garden of Eden
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.420]   in Genesis chapter one, and man introduced sin
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.880]   and everything fractured, and the Bible teaches
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.580]   that everything will be restored and made new.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.140]   In fact, in Romans chapter eight, if you have a Bible,
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.700]   you can read that later or you can read it later tonight.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.700]   You can write it in Romans chapter eight.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.580]   Paul begins to talk about creation and he says,
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.720]   "The world around us, it's like it remembers
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.580]   "not being subjected to futility," is what he says.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.700]   "It remembers what it was like to not be broken,
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.340]   "that the creation," it says, "longs," Paul says,
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.160]   "every tree, everything that you see,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.720]   "the mountains, the sea, the ocean,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.220]   "all of it longs to be set free,"
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.080]   Paul says in Romans chapter eight,
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.700]   "from the bondage that came with sin."
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.860]   It longs to experience being set free
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.800]   and there's gonna come a day where everything is set free,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:04.940]   where every animal, every plant, everything will be set free.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.220]   This earth will be entirely made new.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.700]   There's gonna be a new Mount Everest.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.220]   There's gonna be a new, like a redeemed or restored,
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.220]   made new again Hawaii, think about that.
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.500]   There's gonna be a new Dallas,
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.140]   hopefully with more things to do.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.380]   There's gonna be a new, wherever you live,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.180]   wherever you're from, all of it will be made new.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.540]   Here's why that's important, because that means
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.780]   that it changes the way that you live this life.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.260]   Like you don't have to, if you're a Christian,
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.780]   you're gonna spend eternity and eternity
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.140]   and forever and ever on the new earth,
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.980]   in a earth 2.0, where everything good about this earth
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.740]   is you're currently experiencing and is there,
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.180]   only it's even better and it has nothing,
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.820]   the curse of sin that's a part of it.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.380]   It means that you don't have to have a bucket list
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.380]   if you're a Christian, because you're gonna,
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.780]   you can just have a list, 'cause you're like,
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.480]   "Hey, look, I can go to Everest in this life
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.500]   "or in the next and I can't die in the next one."
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.660]   And, "Or I can go to Hawaii in this one,
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.300]   "or I can go to Hawaii 2.0, maybe I'll wait for that one."
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.780]   And it can allow you that, "Man, I'm gonna do
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.380]   "maybe the only thing that I can't do in eternity
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.340]   "in the new heavens and earth,"
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.780]   which is tell people about Jesus.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.140]   I don't have to spend my life being like,
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.940]   "How am I gonna get the most adventures
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.080]   "and experiences for me in this life?"
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.740]   Because I'm gonna have forever and ever and ever,
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.500]   I don't have to have a bucket list.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.660]   I can just have a list.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.300]   What the Bible teaches about where we are right now
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.460]   is that we are not at the final destination.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.060]   There's gonna come a day where everything
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.620]   broken in this world will be made new.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.780]   And that's ultimately where we're gonna spend eternity.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.420]   It's like we're at the airport.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.300]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.740]   Tomorrow I'm gonna go to an airport,
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.660]   'cause we're flying out of town for something.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.800]   And I don't know if you've been to an airport recently,
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.580]   here's what every person at the airport has in common.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.860]   No one wants to be there, okay?
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.900]   It's, I mean, true, it's one of the few places in life
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.680]   where everyone's like, "Yeah, I don't wanna be here.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.940]   "I'm waiting here in order to get to my destination."
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.740]   Like truly, you look around and it's,
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.060]   there's some places in life you go
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.820]   and some people wanna be there and some people don't.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.180]   And then there's places like the airport
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.460]   where it's like literally everyone is like,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.500]   "I am, this is not where I'm supposed to be right now.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.340]   "I can't wait to get to my final destination."
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.640]   That's what the Bible says this earth is like.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.580]   That it is a place where it is not your final destination.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.740]   And so as crazy as it would be for someone to be like,
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.700]   "I'm gonna post up shop and really go all in
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.420]   "investing in my little chair at the airport
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.860]   "because this is my life.
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.980]   "I'm gonna really invest here and this is what I care about."
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.300]   That's how it talks about this world or this earth.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.220]   It would be just as crazy for us
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.120]   that ultimately it is not the destination
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.260]   that you and I will spend our lives.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.100]   And the destination we will spend our lives
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.420]   is crazy as it thinks to be like,
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.420]   "How amazing is heaven gonna be?"
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.300]   Everything broken in your world and in my world
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.140]   will be no more, the curse will be over.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.100]   There will be no more breakups.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.620]   There will be no more job loss.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.980]   There will be no more cancer, no more death,
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.700]   no more sickness, no more back pain, no more balding,
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.900]   no more need for medical attention,
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.740]   no more anything wrong with this world.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.620]   No more battle of the bolds or fight against gravity.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.920]   You're gonna have totally redeemed and glorified bodies.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.800]   That's what the Bible teaches awaits you and me.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.440]   And it will be fully inside of the presence of God
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.180]   in His very first action we're told.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.520]   Did you read it?
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.820]   What's the very first thing that God does?
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.900]   Is it sit you down and scold you?
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.820]   Hey, let me tell you, all right,
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:27.940]   let's play the clip here, huh?
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.900]   What were you thinking here?
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.900]   Let's talk about this one.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.000]   Is that what God does?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.020]   No, it's like the most intimate act you could do.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.460]   He reaches across in the same hands that were crucified,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.080]   wipes away the tears of His children.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.660]   I mean, how intimate is that?
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.860]   I mean, if I was to come up, if you were crying
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.660]   and I just came up and I was like,
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.060]   you may take a swing and be like, what are you doing, man?
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.520]   It's like a father wiping away his child's tears.
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.460]   And that's what awaits us.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.900]   And that's the very first act that He does.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.580]   What else awaits us is a pleasure, the Bible says,
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.180]   that comes from being in His presence.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.120]   It says in His presence, Psalm 16,
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.140]   there is pleasures forever.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.200]   Like so many pleasures and in such a level
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.140]   you can't even begin to comprehend them is what it teaches.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.580]   I mean, truly, this is where I think it almost breaks down
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.140]   and it becomes hard for us to even have a knowledge
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.020]   of what could possibly await us.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.360]   Because we don't have a category for the pleasures
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.500]   of an eternal realm, an eternal heaven
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.540]   where everything is healed and everything is right.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.260]   We only have the pleasures of this world
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.100]   to kind of compare it.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.100]   It's like this, it would be like attempting to explain
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.940]   the pleasure of sex to a child who thinks
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.380]   the highest pleasure in the universe is chocolate.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.300]   They would be like, what is it like?
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.580]   And I mean, think about that.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.860]   They would have no category for it.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:48.780]   They'd be like, what do you mean?
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.300]   You're like, yeah, probably the height of human pleasure
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.860]   would be sex and marriage and intimacy.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.660]   And they'd be like, well, is it like chocolate?
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.020]   'Cause chocolate is the greatest.
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.620]   You're like, no, it's not really like chocolate.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.460]   It's way better than chocolate.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.620]   And they're like, well, it's chocolate?
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.440]   Do you eat chocolate?
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.280]   Is it a part of it?
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.100]   Not usually, but it's way better.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.860]   I mean, they just couldn't, think about it, truly.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.900]   They just couldn't have a category.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.900]   'Cause they're like, I can't even imagine a pleasure
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.740]   better than chocolate.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.860]   That's what it's like when you and I think of like,
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.780]   man, well, is it like, you know, is heaven like,
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.240]   you know, just endless, fill in the blank.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.000]   It's like, man, it's so much better
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.780]   than you can even comprehend is what the Bible teaches.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.220]   And that's what awaits you and I.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:37.260]   Well, it awaits a particular group of people.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.500]   So the first idea of, hey, what is heaven like?
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.340]   It's this place where the earth is redeemed
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.140]   and made new and restored.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.140]   It's a place full of the presence of God
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.980]   and the pleasure that comes from living in his presence.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.980]   And then it tells us who will be there in verse six.
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.040]   Jesus said, it is done.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.780]   I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.720]   To the thirsty, I will give water without cost
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.460]   from the spring of the water of life.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.140]   Those who are victorious will inherit all of this
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.180]   and I will be their God and they will be my children.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.280]   But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile,
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.440]   the murderers, the sexually immoral,
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.120]   those who practice magic arts,
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.800]   which is essentially a word that, it's a word pharmakia,
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.700]   it essentially was like drug use at that time.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.180]   The idolaters and all liars, they will be consigned
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.380]   to the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.180]   This is the second death.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.460]   And then in verse nine through 26, he begins,
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.620]   John talks about some of the dimensions
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.460]   and almost like the measurements of heaven.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.180]   You should go read it later.
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.860]   Wish we had enough time to cover all of that.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.200]   But I'm gonna keep going as he relates
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.460]   to really just covering who will spend eternity
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.460]   in the new heavens and the new earth.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.100]   And he says this in verse 27.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.700]   Nothing impure will enter it, the new heavens and new earth,
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.120]   nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful,
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.420]   but only those whose names are written
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.720]   in the Lamb's book of life.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.900]   So if you take notes, you can write it,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.260]   who will spend eternity with God?
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.900]   And we're gonna go through what the scripture says,
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.940]   are those who will spend eternity with God.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.060]   'Cause it says several things.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.620]   It says thirsty, what does that mean?
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.940]   Those who accept freely, those who are victorious
[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.540]   or overcome, you may have in your translation,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.540]   and those whose names are written
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.620]   in the Lamb's book of life.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.340]   What does it mean that those who are thirsty?
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.420]   What does it mean to be thirsty?
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.680]   It means people who acknowledge their need.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.820]   Like if I was to show up to a group of people
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.780]   that half of them had just finished running a marathon,
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.300]   they were dehydrated, they were dying of thirst,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.260]   and then the other half was like,
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.180]   no, I've got a camelback on, I've been great.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.340]   You would see, hey, one group has a need,
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.180]   they are thirsty and in need,
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.320]   and they acknowledge their need,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.340]   they're willing to take a drink.
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.300]   The other is like, man, I'm totally fine.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.920]   Jesus says the people who will spend eternity in heaven
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.100]   are those who say, I need a savior.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.580]   I need someone who can save me.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.980]   And he says that the ones who will spend eternity with him
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.300]   are those who say, I accept the free gift.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.920]   That's what it says.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.460]   They accept without cost that Jesus will provide
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.580]   the eternal life or the payment for their sin
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.940]   by giving his life in their place.
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   He said those are the people
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.960]   that will spend eternity with God.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.380]   Not good people.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.940]   You hear it said every single week
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.380]   that the Bible doesn't teach, and it's insane
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.960]   how many people out there think the Bible teaches,
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.540]   Christianity teaches, the God who's up there
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.100]   wants good people in heaven and bad people in hell.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.900]   And the way you get to heaven is by being good.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.220]   The Bible doesn't say.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.520]   Whosoever behaves shall not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.460]   It says whoever believes.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.300]   What does it mean to believe?
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.720]   It means to, by faith, put your trust in Jesus.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.800]   His death in your place, dying for your sin.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.540]   His resurrection from the grave, showing the check cleared.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.320]   It went through, it was more than enough.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.700]   The Bible teaches that person will have eternal life.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.160]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.020]   It's not, hey man, if you do good things,
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.000]   then you'll be with God in heaven forever.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   And the only way that you can accept that
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.620]   is by coming to a place where you're like, I'm thirsty.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.960]   And if I'm gonna get into heaven, God,
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.820]   it's not gonna be 'cause I cleaned myself up.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.960]   If I'm gonna stay out of heaven,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.620]   it's not gonna be 'cause man, I'm a bad person.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.840]   You don't know what I've done.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.760]   Both of those reflect someone who's not thirsty
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.840]   or not willing to accept the payment Jesus made
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.420]   freely for them.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.580]   I mean, if you've ever wondered like, man, isn't it,
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.660]   really God just accepts the good people.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.860]   You have not read the Bible.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.060]   I mean, at Jesus's last moments on planet Earth,
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.680]   there's this moment where he has this occasion
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.700]   with these two thieves,
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.900]   and there's these thieves surrounding him.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.220]   So Jesus is being crucified,
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.700]   and it says that he's crucified between two thieves,
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.340]   or two criminals is the word that's used.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.780]   And these were men who had not just broken any kind of law.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.660]   If you were crucified in that day,
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.620]   it would be synonymous with the type of crimes at our day
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.980]   that would merit the death penalty.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.860]   In other words, in Jesus's day, it wasn't like,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.420]   oh man, you're speeding on your camel.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.680]   Give them the crucifixion.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.980]   It would be crimes that just like today,
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.380]   you don't get killed, capital punishment for speeding.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.580]   You get capital punishment for murder, for rape,
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.060]   for something, for terrorism.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.020]   That's the type of actions that these two thieves,
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.300]   that the son of God, perfect righteousness,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.360]   is being crucified between.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.580]   And in one of the last moments
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.020]   that Jesus has on planet Earth,
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.140]   one of the criminals asked Jesus for a favor.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.940]   He says, I've spent my whole life running from you.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.940]   He had done things that who knows what he had done.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.820]   Something on the equivalent of murder or rape.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.020]   He had ruined someone's life,
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.860]   maybe taken someone's son or daughter and killed them.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.100]   And he looks at the son of God and says,
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.540]   will you remember me?
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.900]   I'm gonna ask you a favor.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.520]   I got nothing else to ask.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.980]   I got nowhere else to go, Jesus.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.040]   My hands are nailed to a piece of wood.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   Will you remember me?
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.860]   He was thirsty.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   And Jesus said what he would say to you,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.140]   and he says to anyone who acknowledges,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.940]   I'm unworthy, God.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.340]   Will you remember me?
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.540]   And Jesus says, today you will be with me in paradise.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.660]   You will be with me because of nothing that you did,
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.020]   despite everything wrong that you did,
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.220]   but the fact that you were simply thirsty.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.260]   You acknowledge your need.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.400]   All you need is need to be a Christian.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.360]   It's the message of Christianity.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.260]   So who's gonna be in heaven?
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.980]   Someone who acknowledges their thirst,
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.140]   acknowledges their need.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.940]   And then he says, those who are victorious.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.100]   What does that mean?
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.380]   You gotta be victorious?
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.060]   The word victorious is the Apostle John,
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.600]   it's really kind of one of his favorite words
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.900]   inside of the book of Revelation.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.140]   It's the word nekeo, if you've heard that word before.
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:39.660]   And inside of the book of Revelation,
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.980]   he uses it several times.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.660]   The good news is if you're like victorious,
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.480]   am I victorious?
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.320]   I don't know if I'm victorious.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.460]   I definitely wasn't in March Madness.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.500]   What does it mean to be victorious?
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.580]   He gives us the definition in 1 John chapter five
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.780]   where he says, who is victorious?
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.220]   And he answers his own question.
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.740]   1 John chapter five, verse five.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.680]   So the person who accepts freely,
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.380]   the person who's victorious.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.380]   And he says this, who is it that overcomes or is victorious?
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.340]   It's the same word.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:11.300]   Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:12.820]   What does it mean to be victorious?
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:17.020]   It means that you have accepted Jesus as your Savior,
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.060]   as the Son of God.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.860]   That's the person who overcomes.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.940]   Then he tells us who won't be there.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.580]   The cowardly, the unbelieving.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.740]   And he goes through a list that essentially
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.720]   could stop right there, unbelieving.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.820]   Anyone who hasn't put their faith in Jesus.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.020]   So they're defined by sexual immorality,
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.540]   drug abuse, that's what he says.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.300]   By the actions that they've done in this life.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.460]   They're not defined by Jesus.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.180]   So anyone who has not believed in him.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.900]   And then if you're like, well, I haven't done those things
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.260]   and maybe I haven't been sexually immoral,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.140]   then he says liars and he covers everybody.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.300]   And he says, these are the people who will not be there.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.300]   Anyone who has not trusted in Jesus will spend eternity.
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:03.580]   And then finally he says that those who are there
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.580]   will be those whose name is written
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.580]   in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.840]   How crazy is this, dude?
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.340]   So what the Bible teaches is that there's this book
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.820]   that God has up in heaven somewhere.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.260]   And every time that someone trusts in Jesus
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.700]   or accepts what he did on the cross,
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.160]   man, Jesus, I'm not worthy to get into heaven.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.500]   I messed up today, yesterday, a lot.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.660]   I've done some bad things.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.260]   But I accept that you died in my place because you love me.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.780]   And so I'm not gonna trust in what I've done.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.260]   I'm gonna trust that you died in my,
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.760]   you paid for my sin and you rose from the grave.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.660]   When a person accepts that and trusts in Jesus,
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.660]   their name, it says, is written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.740]   And what the Bible teaches is that whoever's gonna get in
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.700]   to spend eternity with God in the new heavens
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.140]   and new earth has their name written in there.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.540]   If it's not written in there, you're not getting in.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.100]   It comes down to essentially that.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.560]   Not how did they live in this life?
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.000]   It comes down to is their name written in there or not?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.160]   It's essentially like this.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.280]   A few years ago, I was in charge of planning
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.520]   my high school's 10-year reunion,
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.880]   which was, feels like a mistake on their part.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.520]   And so I had to plan a party for like 1,000 people
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.680]   'cause I don't have enough to do.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.720]   And so I, you know, had to rent out a venue
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.120]   and had to like plan out having food and catering
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.040]   and kind of all this stuff.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.440]   And it was down in Houston.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.780]   And planned it all out.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.620]   And I brought my wife who didn't go to high school with me.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.740]   So she's like gonna meet all these strangers
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.500]   who you can barely recognize,
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.580]   1,000 people in my class.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.420]   And so I'm like running around trying to host the event
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.680]   and do, you know, make sure that putting out fires.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.820]   And I was like, I asked my wife,
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.140]   "Hey, will you just stand at the door?
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.080]   "Here's the list.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.100]   "You'll be the entrance, essentially the bouncer."
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.020]   So she's seven months pregnant at this time.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.340]   Just put the prego lady at the front door
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.600]   and be the bouncer, which is pretty genius, honestly,
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.740]   'cause no one's gonna be mean to the pregnant lady.
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.320]   Anyways, and it was further genius
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.740]   because she didn't know anyone from my class.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.860]   So to her, it was like, "Hey, did they buy a ticket?
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.140]   "Is their name on the list?
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.560]   "If it's not on the list, then you can't get in.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.800]   "Just tell me your name, it's on the list."
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.460]   Versus me, who may have been tempted to be like,
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.020]   "Oh man, well, you were kind of the captain
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:05.820]   "of the football team, we'll let you in here."
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.620]   Or, "I think I was kind of mean to you in high school.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.540]   "Get on in here."
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.140]   Or, you know, whatever the excuse was.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.380]   I would have been tempted to, based on who they were
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.820]   or how they behaved or, you know, the high school experience
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.420]   or how did I know them, not necessarily based on
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.380]   whether or not they were just on the list.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.120]   What the Bible teaches is it comes down to simply that.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   If you're gonna spend eternity with God,
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.000]   it's not just your default position.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.660]   The default position of humanity is hell.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.400]   And it's only those whose names are written
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.580]   in the Lamb's Book of Life, is what it says,
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.180]   who have spent eternity with God.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.140]   How do you get your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life?
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.640]   You must be victorious.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.660]   How are you victorious?
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.340]   A person is victorious by simply one thing,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.000]   believing in Jesus.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.060]   That's 1 John chapter five, that's what it says.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.780]   And those who believe in Jesus have accepted.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.300]   This is what the Bible teaches.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.580]   If you have your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life,
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:07.820]   you're victorious.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.660]   And that means you've believed in Jesus,
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.820]   which means you have accepted what he did on your behalf
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.100]   because you acknowledged you were thirsty.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:16.940]   That's what it says.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.980]   That's who's gonna be in heaven, those who are thirsty.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.740]   And so they accept out of their thirst Jesus
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.340]   to quench that thirst or to meet their need.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.860]   And they believe in him and they are victorious forever.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.260]   And they are written in the Lamb's Book of Life forever.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.900]   Those are the ones who are gonna spend eternity
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.320]   with God in heaven.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.700]   Finally, what are we going to do in eternity?
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.540]   In eternity?
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:48.320]   Is it gonna be harps?
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.860]   You know, is it, can we fly?
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.600]   Is it just kind of whatever you want it to be?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.760]   Like, I love cotton candy.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.120]   There's cotton candy everywhere.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.060]   Like, what is heaven gonna be like?
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.120]   And we're told in Revelation chapter 22,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.320]   verses one through five.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.640]   Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life,
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.460]   as clear as crystal,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.820]   flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.920]   Down the middle of the great street of the city.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.640]   And on each side of the river stood the tree of life.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.640]   So the river goes right through the tree of life.
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.500]   Remember the tree of life is from the Garden of Eden,
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.760]   if you've read Genesis.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.520]   That it reappears.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.020]   And inside of the tree of life, right at the tree of life,
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.280]   it is a tree that's bearing 12 crops of fruit,
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.620]   yielding its fruit every month.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.400]   There's food in heaven.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.340]   And the leaves of the tree
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.680]   are for the healing of the nations.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.920]   No longer will there be any curse.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.560]   The throne of God and the Lamb will be in the city,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.100]   and his servants will serve him.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.280]   They will see his face,
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.160]   and his name will be on their foreheads.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.080]   What does that mean?
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.760]   It means, man, there's gonna be no doubt
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.080]   whose they are in eternity,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.000]   because it'll be seen right on them.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.240]   I'm his.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.300]   I'm Christ's.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.040]   There will be no more night,
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   and they will not need the light of a lamp
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.000]   or the light of the sun, for the Lord their God
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.320]   will give them light.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.640]   And they will reign or rule with him.
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.200]   It's the idea of royalty forever and ever.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.160]   And the angel said to me,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.540]   these words are trustworthy and true.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.880]   You can take him to the bank.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.960]   Our third idea is what will we do in heaven?
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.800]   There's two things that really I wanna pull out
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.160]   from this text and from other texts
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.000]   that we see in Scripture.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.480]   The two things that we're gonna do inside of heaven
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.980]   is work and worship.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.160]   Work and worship.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.320]   The Bible just said that, hey,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.720]   the servants of God are gonna serve him.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.600]   They're gonna go throughout life,
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.320]   and in eternity, they're gonna serve God
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.440]   in the new heavens and new earth.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.200]   The Bible tells us in other places
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.380]   that it gives an indication that, hey, we're gonna work.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.860]   There may be some, there's gonna be some way
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.880]   that we experience jobs
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.200]   and experience almost a calling in life,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.400]   that God is gonna assign to each of us
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.880]   some sort of work that we're gonna do
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.100]   for him for all of eternity.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.160]   But it won't be like the work in this life.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.900]   Like, this world is full of work
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.840]   that is just toilsome, or I'm filled with anxiety,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.280]   or there's bad bosses.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.200]   There's all kinds of things
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.240]   that are a result of sin in this life.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.440]   But it says it'll be restored
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.360]   to like it was at the beginning.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.280]   Do you know that there was work
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.600]   before sin entered the world?
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.800]   It was a part of the garden.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.680]   Like, work is not a consequence of sin or the fall of man.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.880]   Work was a part of God's original plan,
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.120]   and in eternity, he is going to allow you and I
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.280]   to experience a work that doesn't bring pain and toil.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.920]   It brings joy and satisfaction.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.440]   It's almost like the things that you do in life,
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.680]   of like, dude, I just feel like alive when I do this.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.720]   I love this type of thing.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.640]   That's the type of thing that you and I are gonna do.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.020]   You may be doing it right now,
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.240]   but there's no question that you're gonna do it
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.520]   for all of eternity, as he's gonna assign,
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.040]   and he wove you stitch by stitch together
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:47.920]   in your mother's womb.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.080]   He knows exactly the best type of calling
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.000]   or work for you to do, and for all of eternity,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.480]   you're gonna experience the joy
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.760]   of getting to do that with him.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.080]   We know that there's certain jobs that won't be in heaven.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.160]   There won't be a need for pastors,
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.240]   because everyone will be saved.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.480]   I'll be looking for work if anyone's hiring.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.120]   And there won't be a need for firefighters,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.200]   because there won't be fire.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.320]   There won't be a need for policemen,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.140]   'cause there won't be crime.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.080]   There won't be a need for medical,
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.400]   for doctors or for nurses,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.800]   because there won't be sickness or death
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.280]   or any of those different things.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.920]   And so, there'll be jobs that won't exist there anymore,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.080]   but there will be, for all of eternity,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.320]   a joy, and you're like, dude, I hate my job.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.960]   I can't even imagine the idea of like,
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.120]   oh yeah, I really enjoy doing this.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.420]   Even that will be removed,
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.840]   as he will assign you work that brings life.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.160]   It will not be boring.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.480]   Boredom is a symptom of the fall.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.200]   Boredom is a result of sin.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.840]   It's a result of the curse, the Bible says.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.520]   Heaven is not a place that's boring.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.000]   Hell is a boring place.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.240]   Heaven is a place that is every moment
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.520]   increasingly more pleasurable,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.700]   more fulfilling, more satisfying,
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.480]   where every moment is better than the one before it.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.380]   Forever and ever and ever.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.320]   That's what the Bible says you and I will experience.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.520]   And he tells us part of the way that we're gonna work
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.040]   is you and I, if you're a Christian,
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.980]   if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.500]   your name is written in the Lamb's book of life,
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.920]   is you're gonna rule.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.540]   You're gonna reign with God forever.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.540]   What does that mean?
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.580]   I have no idea.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.760]   And there's a lot of debate out there.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.400]   Some people say, man, you're gonna reign over the angels,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.520]   'cause there's indication that
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.560]   that's gonna happen in Scripture.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.240]   Some people, C.S. Lewis thought,
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.880]   hey, you're gonna rule over different galaxies.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.080]   It's not clear exactly.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.520]   Here's what I know it means.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.700]   It means God did not create you for insignificant things.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.220]   That the God who's there looks at you and he's like,
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.620]   look, you're gonna reign with me like royalty.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.720]   You're gonna be, as it were, a prince or a princess,
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.320]   a part of the dynasty of God forever and ever and ever.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.560]   And when he looks at you,
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.180]   he doesn't see some insignificant,
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.720]   hey, you're nothing, you're not that important.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.620]   He looks at you and sees all that will be
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.600]   and can be and should be,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.600]   and he wanted to be from the very beginning of time.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.680]   He sees someone who's gonna rule and reign with him forever,
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.160]   who's the crown of all creation.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.780]   That's what he looks when he sees his children.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.680]   That's what he looks when he sees you.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.580]   And you're gonna reign with him forever and ever.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:12.420]   So the first idea is work,
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.240]   and the second idea, we're told in the Bible
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.960]   and in this text, is that we're gonna worship God forever.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.840]   What are we gonna do in heaven?
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.440]   We're gonna work and we're gonna worship.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.040]   And we think worship, here's where we're doing,
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.200]   we're kind of done a disservice,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.920]   is we've used language that almost makes worship,
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.960]   when I say worship, what do we think?
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.260]   Singing.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.460]   No offense, John.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.560]   We think, hey, that's it.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.600]   We think like, oh my gosh, I'm not even a good singer.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.680]   I really don't like, I try to get here late, honestly,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.000]   because I don't wanna be a part of the songs.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.220]   We're gonna sing forever and ever.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.760]   That doesn't sound exciting.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.380]   Will the Cotton Candy at least be there?
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.040]   And we think that that's what it's gonna be.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.440]   That's not what worship means, biblically speaking.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.000]   When you are given a glimpse in what is worship,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.100]   worship is living.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.120]   The Bible says in Romans chapter 12, verse two,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.720]   that you and I are to offer the way that we live
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.400]   as a spiritual sacrifice to God.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.040]   The way that you date, the way that you handle alcohol,
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.000]   the way that you handle sexuality, the way you use money,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.240]   all that stuff today can be an act of worship.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.900]   And in heaven for all of eternity,
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.240]   the way that you live will be worshiping God.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.680]   And you'll experience a joy from enjoying God
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.840]   forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.520]   That's what we're going to experience in eternity.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.840]   Music is a part of that,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.160]   and that'll be a part of it as well.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:25.140]   But it's not exclusively that, or even mostly music.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.160]   It's the way that you and I live our life
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   for all of eternity.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:33.000]   As a part of worshiping, it'll come and flow just freely
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.320]   from seeing God's face.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.200]   And I wish I had time to really go in depth
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.400]   into what that means, but what John says
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.740]   is that you are gonna see God.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.220]   You're gonna see him eyeball to eyeball.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   If you're a Christian in the room,
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.860]   your eyes are gonna behold him.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.540]   In the Old Testament, we're told that God tells Moses,
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.120]   hey dude, Moses asked God, hey, can I see you?
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:51.960]   I just wanna see you.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.900]   Come on, let me see your face.
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.340]   And God says essentially, if you see me,
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.680]   you're gonna explode.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.600]   That's how amazing I am, which is like,
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.220]   why would you explode if he's so amazing?
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.400]   No idea, but that's how amazing God was
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.680]   to the point where he says, look,
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.720]   hey, I'm gonna cover your eyes and hide you in this rock,
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.860]   and I'll pass before you, and you can kind of see
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.480]   the afterglow of me, and that'll have to be enough.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.160]   And Moses was like, hey, and he passes by before him.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.720]   And it says Moses sees him, and he lights up
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.240]   like a glow stick for a week, just seeing that part of God.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.640]   And it says, man, you're gonna see him face to face,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.040]   and you know what happens when you see him?
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.220]   You're gonna change.
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:34.040]   If you're a Christian, that's why we're told we change.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.940]   In 2 Corinthians chapter three,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.720]   that you and I, when we see God,
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.720]   the more we see him, we're transformed
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.060]   from one degree of glory to the next.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:45.280]   Everything broken about you, every insecurity,
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.000]   every sin temptation, every anxiety,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.640]   everything that was never meant to be a part of you
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.960]   is gonna fall off, and you're gonna see him.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.160]   And if you're a Christian, it's coming.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.040]   That's not some pie in the sky theoretical.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.240]   You're gonna see him, and everything is gonna change.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.000]   You're gonna worship him, and you're gonna work with him.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.900]   I think the biggest challenge is still inside of this room.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   If I'm sitting here, I'm like, man, yeah,
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   I think I wanna go to heaven more now.
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.480]   I don't really know, though.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.800]   I mean, I guess, you know, it sounds like
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.760]   we're gonna have jobs that we don't hate,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.640]   and it's gonna be nice, and I'll get to go
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.720]   to Mount Everest, maybe, and not have to worry
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.640]   about oxygen tanks.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.320]   It sounds pretty cool.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.720]   And you still may be sitting there going,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.960]   like, I don't know if I really want to go.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.720]   I still wanna get married, I still wanna get kids,
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.840]   or I really even want to go to heaven.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   And I don't know that you've ever wanted anything else.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:54.040]   I think at the end of the day, the deepest, strongest desire
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.460]   that you have ever had has been one for him.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.360]   I'll explain it like this.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.640]   When I was in college, I spent five weeks
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.640]   in a village in Africa, and five weeks was like
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.920]   one of those things where I signed up for,
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.840]   yeah, I'll be gone five weeks, it'll be great.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.480]   And like three weeks in, you're like,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.560]   yeah, so this is Africa, okay.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.720]   And I remember feeling so homesick for the last week,
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.500]   or week and a half, and being like,
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.960]   man, my sister had just had a baby,
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.000]   and I had to come back and essentially go right back
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.960]   to school, so it was like my summer's totally gone.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.700]   I'm like missing everything from my mom,
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.020]   to Mexican food, to just air conditioning.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.160]   And I just remember feeling really homesick.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:44.160]   And in this life, every pain, every longing,
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:54.880]   every desire that you've ever had is being homesick.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.540]   Like whether you're Christian or not,
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.880]   you came into the room and you got hurts,
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.040]   you got things that are a part of your life,
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.920]   you got things that you wish you could change about yourself,
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.440]   you got things where you're dissatisfied,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.180]   you got desires maybe to be married,
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.160]   maybe to have a more successful career,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.040]   maybe you have a desire to not have to deal
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.920]   with some of the baggage from your past,
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.840]   or something that's, I don't know,
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.420]   just been a part of your story.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.920]   Maybe you have a deep desire,
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.060]   you just wanna be successful,
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.760]   maybe it's a deep desire, I wanna be married,
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.960]   maybe it's a deep desire, I wanna have kids.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.860]   And when I said the idea that, man,
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:28.700]   maybe you're sitting there going,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.420]   I don't know if I really want to go to heaven.
[00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.940]   I don't know if you've ever wanted anything else.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.920]   Every desire you've ever had.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.200]   You thought it was a desire for a husband,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.640]   but you really just wanted to be loved,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.880]   you wanted to feel the love that will only come
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   in the arms of your Savior someday,
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.560]   in all of eternity, and you're gonna experience it.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.120]   Maybe you wanted to feel security,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.360]   you're like, man, I just don't know
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.480]   if I'm gonna be provided for,
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.400]   and I'm worried, I'm kinda working like three jobs,
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.020]   'cause I'm not gonna go back to where I was,
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.720]   and I was poor growing up,
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.700]   and you have this deep desire to just be provided for,
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.360]   and it's ultimately a desire that will only be satisfied
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.560]   in all of eternity.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.660]   It's a desire for heaven, you're homesick.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.120]   Every desire, every ache, every pain in this life
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.280]   is one that ultimately is just an echo
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.480]   that you're not home, and you're homesick,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.040]   and you came in here tonight homesick,
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.800]   you're gonna leave this room tonight homesick,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.580]   and whether or not you ever come to even realize it,
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.640]   you were born with a desire that was placed
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.660]   inside of your heart, a desire to be home.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.780]   It's a desire that you're gonna have tomorrow
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.720]   when you wake up, in 10 years,
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.020]   at the time that your first child is born,
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.820]   you're still gonna be plagued with that desire,
[00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.680]   and when you're laying on your deathbed someday,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.520]   it's gonna be inside of you beating there,
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.640]   because God tells us he put it there.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.920]   Ecclesiastes chapter three tells us that God said,
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.120]   "I put eternity in every person's heart,"
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.600]   so that that longing, that echo,
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.320]   that craving for something else in this world
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.660]   would never go away.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.100]   No matter how many times they get whatever
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.840]   they thought that they wanted, it's not going away.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.200]   They're homesick, and I put it there
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.120]   so that they would long to be home.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.580]   They would know they're not home yet,
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.440]   but they will be if they trust in the one
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.680]   who gave his life for them.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.480]   If you have never had a moment where you've trusted in Jesus
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.760]   as the payment for your sin, you are homesick,
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.240]   and it is only going to get worse,
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.100]   and you're gonna live, if you die,
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.760]   and you never trust in Jesus,
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.640]   you will live with the reality that you'll never be home,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.280]   and what could have been the infinite joy,
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:35.840]   the ecstasy for all eternity that awaits those
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.600]   who believe in Jesus will be something
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.280]   that could have been, and it slipped from your grip.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.200]   It was just always there, and you never accepted it,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.880]   and you may be thinking, well, man,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.600]   I'm gonna stand before God, and maybe he'll
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.720]   reasonably understand me.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.880]   You're gonna stand before him, and he's gonna say
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.880]   that on April 10th, 2018, you heard the message of Jesus.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.600]   You can no longer live this life being like,
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.740]   I never heard that there's a God out there who says,
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:02.340]   man, I accept people not on the basis of what they do,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.400]   but on the basis of have they accepted my son,
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.020]   and his death in their place, and his resurrection,
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:11.380]   proving he's the son of God.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.260]   I accept people on that, so you can no longer
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.700]   stand before him, and you're gonna stand before him,
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.700]   and you will look at April 10th, 2018,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.140]   will be a day that marks forever your life,
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.780]   forever your eternity, and whether you accepted him or not,
[00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.940]   and the God who's there is crazy about you.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.540]   He's already extended the invitation
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.460]   that he's gonna accept you.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.580]   The question is, will you accept him?
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.660]   Let me pray.
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.240]   (gentle music)
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:42:00.260]   Father, I stand before a group of people
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.740]   who you love way more than I do,
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.940]   and yet even as messed up as my heart is,
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.300]   I can think of no more significant thing
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:20.500]   than if it's true that we really can know
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.900]   where we're gonna spend eternity.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.200]   I can think of no more significant decision
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.020]   that someone could make if it's true
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:32.740]   that the factor of where they're gonna spend eternity
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.820]   is the factor of Jesus, and what do they do with him?
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.920]   And that alone determines everything.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.620]   And so I just ask for your help, Lord.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.180]   I ask that the Spirit of God right now
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.820]   would move in people's hearts,
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:50.020]   would push aside insecurity, push aside pride
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.500]   that's holding people back from making a decision
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.200]   to accept you as their king, their savior,
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:59.500]   to trust in you, that you would open their eyes,
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.820]   and they would be among those
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.620]   who are gonna spend eternity forever and ever with you,
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.100]   their king, the one that all of their life
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.900]   they've longed for, whether or not they even realized it.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:17.060]   Father, we love you, and we wait for that day,
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.380]   and in this life, all we can do is try to dream
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.980]   or imagine or take what you've told us
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.060]   about what it's gonna be like when we're finally home.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.600]   Would you help us in the midst of feeling homesick
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.260]   to not turn to anything other but your love?
[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.660]   As we wait to go home.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.180]   We love you, Jesus.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.940]   Amen.
