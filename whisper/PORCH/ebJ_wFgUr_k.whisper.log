[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   [Music]
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   How we doing on porch?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   [Cheering]
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Come on baby.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Come on, we're back.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Fantasy series.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   We're making it happen.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   I don't know what you said.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   But you're distracting me.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Trying to preach up here.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Oh man, this Saturday.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I'm in bed, like it's, you know, we're sleeping in on Saturday.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And my phone rings like 7.20 a.m.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And it's a buddy of mine.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   He's got some daughters, you know, I've got two daughters.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   And one of our oldest are the same age.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And I'm like, what's he doing calling at 7.20 in the morning on a Saturday?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Like, brother's sleeping.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And so I answer the phone and he's like, hey, here's what's going to happen.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I'm like, okay, I'm listening.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   He goes, I'm at 9.30.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I'm going to pick you up in a Bentley GT Continental.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   We're going to drive to the Addison Airport.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We're going to take a private jet to San Antonio.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I got a limo waiting for us there.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I got a limo waiting for us there.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And we're going to take that to the Riverwalk.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   We're going to go eat lunch.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We're going to take our daughters, our oldest daughters, same age, and we're going to eat lunch.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And then we'll take the limo back.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I'm going to have you back home by 2.30 in the afternoon.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And I'm like, dude, I thought I was watching soccer games today.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Wow, I had no idea.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I didn't know this was going to happen, you know.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And so just in case you were with us last week, had a nice car on stage.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Like private jets are not normal for me.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Like I can count on one finger the number of times I've been on a private jet.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And so we go and we do this, right.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And we go over there to San Antonio.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And then we go to the Riverwalk.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   We go to the Alamo.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Remember the Alamo?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And then right across the street from the Alamo is this tourist trap, right.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's like Ripley's Believe It or Not.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You know, Ripley, you guys have seen it.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   World Record Museum, something or other.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And then there's this like roller coaster, this indoor roller coaster called Tomb Raider 3D.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Not Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 3D.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And so, you know, I'm like, hey, let's do that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I'm up there, I'm buying tickets.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   But then our daughters are like, wait, wait a minute, hold on.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   And they're like looking inside.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   They're trying to, you know, because it's something with like you get guns and shoot zombies or something.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Hey, like what's going to happen in there?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And they're trying to peek in.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And then one of them's like, hey, I'm not going on that unless I know what it's going to be like.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I need to know what to expect.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And so I start there, right.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I'm going to pick up that story in a minute.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   But I start there because I think that's what's happening with marriage, right.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We're getting married later.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We're getting married less.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We're getting divorced more.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And I think we're looking out.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I remember, like, look, I'm married now.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I get it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I get it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You know, what do I know about singleness?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You forget.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I was single, right.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I remember kind of standing out here, like, looking like, okay, do I want to do this?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Kind of dip my toe in the water.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Like, are we sure?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Is it forever, ever, forever, ever, ever?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know, and so, and so you kind of look at it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You're like, well, I don't know what to expect.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Like, unless I know what to expect, I'm not going to move that direction.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's interesting because what I did is I said, okay, hold on.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Let me go talk to the guy.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I'll go talk to the roller coaster guy.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I go up.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I'm like, Mr. Roller Coaster Guy, can you tell me exactly what to expect?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Like, how fast does it go?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Do things jump out at you?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Like, what exactly are we shooting?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And he just, he rolls out the blueprint for the whole ride.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   He's like, this is what's going to happen, you know, and he tells me.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And so I sit them down.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I'm like, hey, you know, here's what's going to happen.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And they listen, right.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   We get on it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And we go through the ride.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It lasts about five minutes, just like he said it would.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   We get off.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And they say, man, that's nothing like we expected.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I'm like, well, that's confusing because I told you exactly what to expect.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And they're like, yeah, you did.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And it was all the things you said and nothing like we expected.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And I'm like, so you don't trust me, you know.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And so here's why I say that because that's what it's been like to teach about marriage for 10 years.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I mean, I've done probably 20-plus weddings.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I've sat down in my living room, my wife and I, with 20-plus couples.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I said, hey, this is what you're going to.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Hey, this is what it's going to be like.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   This is what God says about it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I know you think you're going to be the exception.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You're not going to be the exception.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And then they get in it, right.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And then they call me six months.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   They call me five years.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   They call me later.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And they say, man, it's so different than we expected.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   But it's exactly what you said it was, but so different than what we expected.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And so I want to help you.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I want to help you tonight.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I'm going to tell you this evening what to expect in marriage, a biblical view of marriage.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I'm going to be in Ephesians chapter 5, the last part of that chapter there.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   It's all about marriage.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I'm going to give you a picture of it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   We're in this fantasy series talking about finding real love in a fake world.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Here's what a fake world means.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   With social media telling you, hey, this is what marriage is like.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   With, you know, with magazines, airbrushing, this is what marriage is like.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Movies and TV shows saying, hey, this is what marriage is like.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Tinder and dating apps saying this is how you're married.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I'm going back to the one who invented marriage.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Like he made it.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   It's his idea.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Why?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Why would God, the creator, come up with this idea of marriage?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   What was he doing?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   What was he thinking?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   What does he want from us?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's going to be different than you think.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And as much as I'm able, I want to help you know what to expect so that when you go in there
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and you bump up against these things, you're like, oh, man, he prepared me for this.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   God was so gracious and kind that his word prepared me for this, right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And so as we think about the fantasy marriage, we think about finding the one, our soulmate.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   We think about love at first sight.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   We think about trying to live happily ever after.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We're looking for compatibility.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And what I would tell you is there is no compatibility between sinners.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And guess what you are?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You're a sinner.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And so there's no-- and I know you're like, no, no, no, my boyfriend and I, we have great compatibility.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Yeah, just like your last boyfriend, great compatibility.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You know?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I didn't mean to hurt you.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'm just saying I know you think you're compatible today.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Like call me a couple years into marriage and tell me how that compatibility-- I liken it like this, you know?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It's like oil and water.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Like it doesn't mix.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And what happens is when we get married, like these two substances, they will not mix together.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And when we get married, it's like we try to mix it up, you know?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And everybody comes and there's-- oh, it's leaking a little bit.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And there's, you know, a white dress and cake.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And they come and they're like, oh, man, it looks like it's mixed.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   They go so well together, those two.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So beautiful, so well mixed together.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   But it doesn't stay that way.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It slowly over time, when the feels, all the feels go away, it slowly separates back to something that is not compatible.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So you have to have something else working toward your favor in this, right?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And I'm really compassionate toward you.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Girls, I know since you were four years old, man, you've been reading the Disney stories.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   You were a Disney princess for Halloween, right?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And you've been looking for your happily ever after Prince Charming,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   someone that's going to bring the glass slipper that fits perfect and take you off in a carriage forever and ever to his palace.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I get that.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And guys, since the fifth grade, you've been looking for someone to live out all your crazy sexual fantasies and clean your room.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And I know that. No, I get it, man.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I understand.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And I'm just telling you, it's not like that.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Those expectations are setting you up for major failure.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And I know that our expectations are off because, you know, every couple, when I do their wedding, I have them take this test, this prepare and enrich test.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   That's not like pass or fail. It just shows us what to work on.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And they miss these questions. All of them, I believe all of them have missed these questions or at least most of them.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   It says, "My partner will meet all my needs for companionship."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And they say, "True, it's false."
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "My partner's interest in sex will be the same as mine."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   They say, "True, it's false."
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   They say, "Nothing could cause us," this is a big one, "Everyone is missing."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   "Nothing could cause me to question our love for one another."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I got to tell you something, you're going to be questioning your love for one another before you get back from the honeymoon.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Like that's the truth.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   You can't go in there with these rose-colored glasses because you're going to be thinking, "Man, did I marry the wrong one? Is this really working? What did I do?"
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I believe I know everything there is to know about my partner.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   They said, "True, it's false."
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And so as we move through this series, we talked about what love really is.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We talked about what to look for in a woman, what to look for in a man.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Tonight we're talking about what you are actually looking for in marriage.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   If you want to be married, this is what I want you to know.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I want you to be married.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Like if you desire marriage, then I desire marriage for you.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I want to help you get there, and it's a good thing.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And I hope that you desire marriage.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I'm going to show you tonight, you have two options.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's marriage or singleness for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   There's no other options.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   So you either want to be married or you want to serve Christ with your life, with reckless abandon, with all that you can.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You want to leverage your singleness for Him.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We did a great message on singleness.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   You can go search it, singleness.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I'd encourage you to on the porch.live or watermark.org, and it is there for your learning, for your consumption.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   But if you desire marriage, I want you to get married.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That's what I hope happens.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I hope this is a space maker message.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Not because I scare you off, but because you get married and have babies and stop coming.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I hope that's what God does tonight.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And so we're talking about fantasy marriage, what to expect.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And as we move through Ephesians 5, 21 through 33, we're going to talk about how to expect sacrifice and expect to sacrifice and submit.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Expect to be sanctified through service and expect that it is all about your Savior.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Not about you, but all about your Savior.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Let's dive in verse 21.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You want a picture of marriage?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   We can't get one line into marriage without talking about Christ, without talking about Jesus.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body of which he is the Savior.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   You can underline submit there.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It's said a few times, all right, we can't get away from this.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Like you might be thinking, man, the Apostle Paul just kind of went crazy here and that's not biblical.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The Holy Spirit took his hands off the wheel and that shouldn't be in the Bible.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Except for it says in 1 Peter 3, verse 1, wives in the same way, submit yourselves to your own husbands.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   In Colossians 3, verse 18, wives submit yourselves to your husbands as fitting to the Lord.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   So it seems like God means this, like he's serious.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   But let me bring some clarity to this because it doesn't say women submit to men.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And it doesn't say women submit to sin.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And so if a man is asking you to sin, don't submit to him.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That even rhymes for you, okay?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   So do not submit to any man who's asking you to sin.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   You submit to the Lord.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   It's not saying submit to your boyfriend.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   If your boyfriend's coming at you, quoting to you from Ephesians, I'd peace out on that, okay?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So that's not what this is saying.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's saying wives submit to your husbands.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Which is, you know, you can say it's outdated.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   You can say, hey, that's old school.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The Greek, I've studied it.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   That's not really what it means.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You'd be wrong.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now, let me show you something else, though.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Stay put.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   I see your scowl.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Calm down, ladies.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Verse 25, husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Now, if we were to say in a word what that's saying husbands should do,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   the best word that I can come up with is this word, sacrifice your life.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Now, those are two really big asks.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Wives, submit to your husbands.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That's a big ask.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It's a tall order.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I'll give you that all day.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And then it says husbands, sacrifice your lives for your wives.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   That's a tall ask, too.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I might argue that's a bigger ask, like give up everything for her.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And I would tell you, ladies, if he did that, submitting to his leadership wouldn't be any problem at all.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So you want to say I do to a guy that you're confident is going to do that,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   that he's willing to sacrifice his life for you.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And so in like our fantasy ideas, we think, you know, find the one or find our soulmate.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   But the mandates of marriage is sacrifice and submission.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   My first point, the mandates of marriage is sacrifice and submission.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   We think, you know, it's like, OK, the mandate of marriage is to find my soulmate and see the world.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   But the Scripture says, no, it's sacrifice and submission.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And really what Paul is doing here is he's nodding his head at a metaphor of marriage, that it is all about Jesus,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   that we cannot talk about this text without understanding fully what that is.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And it's going to be different than what you think.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It's going to be bigger and grander and more amazing, incredible and more important than you could have ever thought.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And in fact, Christ is our example.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   When we think about submission. When we think about sacrifice, Jesus is what we look to to learn how to do that.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   In Philippians chapter two, it says that Jesus, who being in the very nature of God,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   but instead he considered himself nothing, became like a servant and sacrificed his life according to the father's will.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   He gave up everything.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And so what is the ask of you when you think about marriage?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's give 100 percent and expect minimal in return.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And let's just agree that's extremely difficult.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   How does anybody do that?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And as you're thinking about, well, are they someone that I might spend the rest of my life with?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I would ask you, how do they submit to authority?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   How do they deal with this? Are they like do they have a chip on their shoulder like their way or the highway?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   They think they know it all. Pride marks them.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Are they ready to come under an authority? I'm talking men and women.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Because we can't forget it says submit to each other.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   This is a two way street.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Out of your reverence for Christ.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Submit to each other.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   And so how do they do that? This is an important idea to think through when you're considering who you might spend the rest of your life with.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And so what I would tell you is to stop looking for the one.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   You're not looking for the one. You're looking for someone.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Who has submitted their lives to the one. Capital T. Capital O.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I know we're looking for our soul mate. Someone perfect for us.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   You find someone and let God make them the one.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   There is no one. You've got to understand this. There's not a one.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That's a bad idea. It's a bad theology.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And I've said this. I've taught this through the years. There's lots of dating messages on our app.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   You can go back and listen to all of them.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   But to try to say this in a new way, let me just say it's mathematically impossible.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   There are 66 million more men in the world than women.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   66 million. That's a huge number.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Ladies I just heard your heart break.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   It's a depressing stat. I get it.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's going to be okay though, right?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Because you're not looking for just anyone. You're not looking for the one.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   You're looking for the one who's already submitted his life to the one.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Who knows Christ and is living for Christ.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Not a soul mate, but a S-O-L-E mate.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   One mate. A singular mate.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   So not a soul mate, but a soul mate. S-O-L-E mate.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And so that's who you're trying to find in this idea.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And the good news is, is there's all kinds of people that you can make that work with.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And in fact, whoever you marry, this is what I want you to know,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   whoever you marry, there will be someone better suited for you than them out there in the world.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   You need to know that.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   So that's kind of like hitting the pressure release valve.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Take a deep breath. I don't have to find the perfect person.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I just have to find someone who knows the one who is perfect.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And is pursuing them and who they're going to make the perfect person.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   This is good news, right?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   You say, "Well, how do I train for that?"
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   You know, sacrifice and submission.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Have roommates.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   I encourage all my single friends, have roommates.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I'd get the dysfunctional kind if I were you.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   That will help you for marriage, okay?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Get the ones that don't do the dishes, you know?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   That will help you and prepare you for marriage.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And if you're here and you're thinking, "Man, I just don't know if I'm up for..."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   You think I'm kidding, by the way, I'm not.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I've been saying that for 10 years now. I stand by it.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   People have come back and thanked me for that.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Okay, if you live alone, I wouldn't.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Alright, if you're like, "Well, I just like to live alone."
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   You're going to hate marriage because there's someone always there, like right beside you, like a shadow, man.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And so, I would get roommates.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I mean, that's great training.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I would serve. I would look for opportunities to put your own selfish desires aside.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   To think about, "Hey, how can you sacrifice your desires for somebody else?"
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And if you don't want to be married, if you're like here and you're like, "Well, I don't want to be married."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   I just, I want to present that other option to you one more time.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   The other option the scripture gives you is in Matthew 19, it's to be single for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Not to sow your wild oats, to see the world, you know, to see how many shots you can take before you pass out.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Like, that's being single in the wrong way.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   And it's a dishonoring to the one who created you and gave you a purpose.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   You're living outside your purpose and it's going to leave you despairing.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   It's going to leave you really sad and depressed.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   I don't want that for you.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   So, you can be single so that you can go and take the gospel as many places as possible and build the kingdom.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Or you can get married.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And if you're single, live radically sold out for Jesus.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   That's really your only option.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Live for the one who created you.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And I would just tell you in this idea of sacrifice and submission, like I can do anything in a moment.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I can write a love song.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   I can write poetry, say, tell you how beautiful you are.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I can even take out the trash for a minute, right?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   But to do that every single day of my life, over and over and over, that's what you're trying to find out.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Are they up for that?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Are they consistent?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Are they sustaining?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   This is what God, this is how God loves us.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   It's in a sustainable, constant, ongoing, forever kind of way.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And marriage is a metaphor showing the world His love.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And so that's how we love each other in marriage.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   My wife and I, we disagree on a lot of things, challenges in marriage.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And so one of those things through the years has been a big point of contention has been pets.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   So we haven't had any because I think they're pets and she thinks they're people.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And so we just have avoided that.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   But I'm reading Ephesians 5.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You know, I'm supposed to like love her as Christ loved the church.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And I'm like, I think that means get a dog.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And so I did.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And primarily motivated too, in addition to that, motivated because my daughter was like,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   you know, I just want a puppy, Daddy, I want a puppy.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And all right, so we got a puppy and I even let her inside.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And I know, because that's what Jesus would do.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And so it's like I tell my daughter Finley, who just loves this puppy so much, wanted her so much, you know.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And I say, hey, you never have to wonder if I love you.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   If you ever ask for a second, like, does Daddy really love me?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   You just look at that puppy.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Because that is me laying my life down for you.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And it's like God says to you, hey, you don't ever have to wonder if I love you.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And we wonder sometimes, right?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   When things get hard, we start to question, God, do you really love me?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   I think that breaks us hard.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But you don't ever have to wonder if God loves you.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   It's like he's saying to you, hey, if you ever wonder if I love you, you just look at the cross.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   That's where I allowed my son to die on behalf of you, to purchase you to myself so that I can spend forever with you.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I paid the ultimate price.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   And so you think about how permanent that is, that you've been sealed by his Holy Spirit,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   that he gave up what was most precious to him to display his love for you forever.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Verse 26, talking about Christ and the church, it says,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   "To make her holy," that word, "to make her holy" or "to make holy" is a word, "sanctification."
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   If you ever hear that's a Christian word, "sanctification" just means to make holy.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   "To make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   In this same way, husbands," so he's talking about Christ and the church, and then he goes,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   "In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   He who loves his wife loves himself. After all, no one ever hated their own body,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   but they feed and care for their body just as Christ does the church, for we are members of his body."
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And so he's going, "Marriage and Jesus and the church and marriage and Jesus,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   wives and husbands, Jesus and the church, wives and husbands, Jesus and the church."
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   He's just going back and forth, weaving it together, giving you a clue.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Hey, there's something more to marriage than you think there is.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Stop listening to Cosmo or Esquire or ETV or MTV or The Bachelor
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   because there's something more to marriage than you think.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   It's bigger than you think.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And when he says, "Cleansing her by the washing with water through the Word,"
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   he's not talking about baptism. He's talking about how the Word of God purifies us.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   That when we read the Scripture, maybe you think it's pointless to move through the Bible,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   but it's not pointless because the Holy Spirit is doing something through the Word of God.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   He's cleansing you.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And so as I lead my family, one of the ways that I need to lead my family
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   is to make sure that we are on the regular getting into the Word of God.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And so if you're here and you're asking, "Hey, am I marriage material? Am I marriage material?"
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   I got one really simple quiz question for you.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Did you spend time in God's Word today?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Were you cleansed by the washing as though through the Word of God today?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Did that happen? And yesterday and tomorrow?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And that's just a simple step that you can take to prepare you for whatever is next and for this day.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Let a day go by, not in a form of legalism, but in a form of adoration and worship.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Spend time in God's Word.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "Man, but it doesn't make sense, and I daydream, and I just don't get it. It's a big Word."
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   It's okay. Just read the Word. Get a commentary. Take your time. Go verse at a time.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   There's never been more resources in the history of the world than right now to help you.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And that's on the Internet. It's amazing.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And so the fantasy for us is we want to live happily ever after,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and have our own little play partner, our own little live-in handyman to fix things.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I think girls think that marriage is like one long conversation, just one never-ending,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   "Me too, me too. Let me tell you about my day. Really, my life."
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And guys think it's like one big sexual escapade.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   There's some blend of both.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   But the mission of marriage, my second point, the mission of marriage is sanctification through service.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Sanctification through service.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's not sex and a long conversation. It's sanctification through service.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   As I said, sanctification is just a big theological word. It means becoming holy.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Bruno Mars says, "I love you just the way you are."
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   But what marriage really does, what sanctification means, is it means change.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   It means that the person that you marry, surrendered to the Holy Spirit, is becoming more like Christ.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   That the Holy Spirit is making them more like Christ.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Now I want to be clear here. You don't marry them hoping they will change.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I've seen a lot of people make that mistake.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Like if they're a slob today, they're probably going to be a slob tomorrow.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   The Holy Spirit may leave that just the way it is. I'm not sure.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And so that's true in my case. Just be honest.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Meaning I'm a slob, not my wife. Like she married a slob.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   I mean, go look at my truck. She won't even get in my truck.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Like she's like, "Hey, we're taking my car if we go anywhere."
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Like she's going with me. Because I'm a little messy.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You know? It's just the part of my heart that the Holy Spirit hasn't done something with yet.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   You guys pray for me, pray for her. You know it's going to happen.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   But don't seek to change them.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Because God changes them. That's God's job.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   This was breakthrough in my marriage.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And so two years into marriage, like we were headed toward divorce.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Was not good. I was a complete mess and not just messy room.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I mean, I was a train wreck.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   But we were believers. We both had trusted in Christ.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   We were new believers, but we were believers. Christians.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And reading the scripture, and I had this revelation.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   It was a really simple revelation. Here's the revelation.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   You know, she has the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And see, up until then, I had tried to make her who I wanted her to be.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   I was trying to, like I jumped into this marriage, made a covenant with God,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   and now I'm going to make you into the wife that I want you to be.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And it looked a lot like parenting or child rearing.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And I realized, I'm reading the scriptures like, "Shame on me.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   That's not the job of a husband.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   And she's not a child. She's a grown woman.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And she's, you know, God is at work in her life.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   And so all I need to do is trust the Spirit.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And if there's something that I disagree with, like she tells me something that I may disagree with,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I don't need to respond in such a way that's disrespectful or unloving or uncherishing to her.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I can say, "God, is that you?"
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Because it might be.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Because he lives in her.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   And so if my first step is, "That's ridiculous,"
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I may be telling God, "You're ridiculous."
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And so my first step needs to be, "Okay, hey, I hear you. Let me repeat it.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Let me take that into consideration."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And I don't need to change.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Like over the decades of our life and our marriage,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   the Lord will change her, making her more like Jesus.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And he's changing me, making me more like Jesus.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And if he's changing both of us, making us more like Jesus,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   then we're just going to grow closer and closer and closer and closer.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   That's the truth. That's reality.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   So I can trust God's work in her life,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and she can trust God's work in my life.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And so what do I need to do?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I need to, especially as a single person,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   you need to grow a healthy appetite for service.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Hey, how do I move to a place where I actually enjoy serving?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   There's this idea repeated in this text.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   It says in verse 28, "Husbands, love your wife as you love your own body."
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And he says that over and over and over.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Did you see that? Like three times he's like, "Care for her like you care for your own body."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Right? Now what does that mean?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   When I'm hungry, what do I do?
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   That's right. I eat.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   You got it right.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Let's try this one. One more.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   When I'm thirsty, what do I do?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   That's right.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   That's right. I get something to drink.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And so now I have this other person in my life that I'm to care for,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and so I'm to be sensitive, in tune to her needs and desires,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   so that if she's thirsty, I get her something to drink.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   If she's hungry, then I'm planning on where we're going to eat.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   I'm making provision in that way.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I'm thinking about someone else other than myself all the time.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   That's marriage.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Let me give you a real life example.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   We have this king-size bed,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and we have like a knock-off, tempur-pedic mattress, a foam mattress.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And I love, like when it's kind of cool, like fall weather,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I may be the only one, but we have this big comforter.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   You know, I pull back the comforter, and I roll into that bed,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   and I just like all like snuggle up in there.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   It's just like, "Shh." Like I'm about to go to sleep,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   and it's just amazing what's about to go down.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I'm going to pray and then go to sleep, and it's awesome.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And she gets in bed too, and she's about to go to sleep,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   and it's amazing. It's just so great to go to sleep.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And so my head is on my pillow, and I'm dozing off.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I'm asleep. Like I'm there. I'm dreaming.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And she goes, "Babe, are you up?"
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am now.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   I'm cold.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   That's interesting.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Thank you for waking me up to tell me that.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   I'll pray for you.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Oh, man, I get my butt out of bed,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   and I turn up the heat, right?
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   You know why?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Because she's cold.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And that's my problem
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   for the rest of my life.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And that's marriage.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   If you don't like to serve,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   you're not going to like marriage.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And if you don't want to change,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   you're not going to like marriage.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Because marriage is about service and sanctification.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   That's the mission.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   That's what happens in marriage.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Ladies, I tell that story up front.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Because we watch "The Bachelor" or "The Bachelorette"
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   or whatever, and we want the fantasy date,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   the crazy, the helicopters and the mountains.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And so I think there's a part of you
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   that would love for some guy to show up
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   in a Bentley GT Continental saying,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "Hey, we're going to our private airplane.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   "I planned a date somewhere.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   "We're going to go sit candlelight by the Riverwalk.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   "I've got a limo for us there."
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And I think there's a part of you
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   that would love that experience,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   because there's something about our generation
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   that is chasing experiences.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   We want the next experience.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   But do you know why I got to go on that trip?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   My daughter and I got to go on that trip.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Because he had planned that as just a great day date.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   But the night before, his other daughter
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   got the stomach bug.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And so his wife had to stay home
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   cleaning up throw up all day.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   And that's marriage.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And so, man, you think you want a trophy wife.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   You don't want a trophy wife.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   You want someone to go to war with you,
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   because life is a war zone.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   That's what it's like.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   It's hard.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Everywhere you go, there's crazy.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   You get home from work,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   and there's crazy waiting on you.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I mean, there's stuff thrown on the wall,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and kids fighting,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and soccer games and practices to go to,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and somebody got in trouble at school,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and you got a parent-teacher conference.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Like, this is the real life.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And it's cool that she's hot,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   but that's not helpful.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Right?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Like, you're looking for a partner,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   for a helper,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   someone to help you.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Both of you.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I'm talking to men and women right now.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   That's real life.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   And that's marriage.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And there are amazing girls
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   all around you guys.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Like some of you, man, I wish you'd wake up.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   It's confusing.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   It's confusing to me, man,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   that you want marriage.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   But if you want marriage, man,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   you have so much opportunity all around you.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Like, take a step.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And can I tell you what I do when I say that?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   I discourage the ladies.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   I know that I do.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I've done this long enough to know that I say things like,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   "Ask the godliest girl out.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   "Find the godliest girl out and ask her out."
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And then all the girls go home with insecurities.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "Well, I guess I'm not godly,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   "'cause he didn't ask me out."
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I know it happens.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   I know I'm not a fool, okay?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Guys, stop making me look like a fool.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I'm at launch retreat.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   It's our Labor Day retreat.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And I'm sitting between a guy and a girl.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And she's sharing some stories with me.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   She's talking about, you know, going,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   moving overseas to serve there
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   with the rest of her life.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   And she's like, "I just don't think, you know,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   "God has marriage for me,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   "because I feel this, like, real calling in my life
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   "to this people group."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And this guy over here, he's like,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   "Well, why don't you find a husband and then go overseas?"
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And I think he had an ulterior motive in saying that.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And I'm kind of sandwiched in the middle,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   like, just listening.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And she's like, you know, "Find a husband,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   "like, someone that God has already called to this place
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   "and to this people and to this tribe."
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And, you know, like, to find a husband is hard enough as it is.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   To find someone with that unique calling,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and she said this line, I wrote it down
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   so I could share it with you.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I hope I never forget it.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   She says, "I would much rather move away and serve
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   "than stay here and search."
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   She looked at him and she said,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   "I would rather go and serve
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "than stay here and search."
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   And I just thought,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   "Ask her to marry you, you know?"
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Verse 31, "For this reason,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   "a man will leave his father and mother
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "and be united to his wife,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "and the two will become one flesh."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   "and be united to his wife,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   "and the two will become one flesh."
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Now, this is so interesting that it's here.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   This also shows up in Genesis.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   There's something crazy here.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   If you've ever heard me talk about sex glue,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   I'm not gonna go into detail right now
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   because I've got message after message after message
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   where I talk about the scientific bonding
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   that happens during sex,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   that science has discovered
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   and they're really finding out
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   what was written thousands and thousands
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and thousands of years ago in the scripture.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   That God is saying, "Hey, something unique happens
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   "when two bond in that way."
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   There's a bonding.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   They become one flesh.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   This is crazy.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   How does that happen?
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   But it happens.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   It's real.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And now science is saying,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   "Oh, and by the way,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   "whenever you experience sex with someone,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   "there's a bonding that happens there
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   "that you try to undo
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   "when you look at pornography
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   "or when you have multiple partners.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "You're carrying that prom date with you
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "for the rest of your life in some ways.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   "I told you it would separate."
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   You see this?
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   It's separated.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   But you see that now,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   after there was a tried-to-be-a-two-become-one,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   both are a little more cloudy.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   There's particles of the water up here
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   and particles of the oil down here
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   that both a little cloudier.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Because two attempted to become one.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   But they didn't stay that way.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   He says, "This is a profound mystery,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   "but I'm talking about Christ and the church.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   "I'm using this verse from Genesis
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   "to explain to you about Jesus and his bride, the church.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "However, each one of you must also love his wife
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   "as he loves himself,"
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   because he didn't beat that dead horse enough,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   "and the wife must respect her husband."
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And so let me just say this with this verse
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   is there's a great book out there called Love and Respect.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It's a fantastic book.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   I think we make everyone read it
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   in their first year of marriage.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And I'll summarize the entire book
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   that women want love and men want respect.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   If you know that, that is a summary
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   of that entire book, Love and Respect,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   and it comes straight from this verse.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   But I want you to know that this idea of sex, too,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   this idea of bonding is something for you to consider
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   that God, he's done something unique to our bodies
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   to help us in marriage.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   In fact, Tim Chester, rather, in closing the window,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   he said this, "You can no more try out sex
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "than you can try out birth.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   "The very act of sex produces a new reality
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   "that cannot be undone."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And so I think that we think the mystery of marriage,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   our fantasy, is that we get to get with someone
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and try out all kinds of crazy stuff
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   for the rest of our lives.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Experiences.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   When the mystery of marriage is not about you at all.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   The mystery of marriage is it showcases the Savior.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   It showcases the Savior.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   And the fantasy is that it's all about your happiness.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   It's all about, hey, how can I experience joy?
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   But it's not about you at all.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   It's not about you just finding someone
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   to pick up after you or to experience things with
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   or change a light bulb.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   It's this reality that you get to showcase Jesus.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Now listen.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   If you were Satan,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   if you were God's enemy,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   and you knew that God had placed this really powerful metaphor
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   on the earth to showcase his majesty to the world
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   called marriage, what would you do with it?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   You'd make it undoable?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Do you know what you would do with it?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   You'd make it all about the people.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   All about the cake.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   All about the dress.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   All about the location.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   We took the one thing that was an opportunity
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   to display to the world God's majesty
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   and we completely caked it in narcissism
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and made it all about us and our emotions in a moment
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   and it doesn't last.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Most of them don't last.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   And even some of the ones that do last aren't happy,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   sleeping in separate rooms,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   throwing stuff against the wall,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   hating each other, dysfunctional, separating.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Man, you've got to figure out what it really is.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   What if?
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   What if?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Like just consider it,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   that God in his might, sovereignty, and grace
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   loves you so much that he has you here tonight
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   to consider this one thing.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   What if marriage is all about Jesus?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   What if it's all about Jesus,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   to teach you something more about Jesus
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   or to display to the world something about Jesus?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Now you can learn things in singleness.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   You can learn about the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   I've taught that, don't listen to that.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   But I'm talking about marriage right now.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   What if marriage is all about teaching us about Jesus?
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   When this was written, what would happen,
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   and I've said this before, I love this idea,
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   it fills my heart, I can't say it enough,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   is that a young Hebrew, a young Jewish boy,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   a young Hebrew boy,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   when he became aged to find a wife,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   he would leave his father's home
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   and he would go to a foreign land in search of a bride.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   And he would look among God's people,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   like he was trying to find the tribes
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   that worship the one true God,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   and he would select a wife from there.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   And when he would find her, they would toast,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   they would pour wine in one cup,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   they would both drink from that cup together,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and he would pay a dowry to her father,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   he would purchase her to himself,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   a high price he would pay.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And then he would leave her,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and he would go home, they're now betrothed,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   they're engaged, if you will,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   he would go home to his father's house,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   and he would begin to build a room for them
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   on his father's house,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   because his father's estate was one day gonna be his estate,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   so he would build what was called the bridal chamber,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   the room attached to his father's house
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   that they were gonna live in,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   and he would spend his time doing that,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   and he's gonna return for her at an hour in a time
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   that she doesn't know.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   And so she's busy making preparations for the wedding,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   choosing her bridesmaids,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   all these traditions like a toast and bridesmaids,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   they come from this idea.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   He builds the house, when he finishes it,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   he goes to that foreign land to get her,
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   and what he does is he sends word in front of him,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   and they would blast trumpets,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   they would blast trumpets so that it would go
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   from one town to the next,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   he's coming for you, he's coming for you,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   they would say his name, he's coming for you.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And so word would go in front of him and get to her,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   oh, he's coming, and she would scramble,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   get her bridesmaids ready, get the dress ready,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   wait for him, and he would come,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   and he would take her to his father's house.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And they would go in that room,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   and they would stay in there for seven days.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   And there was a party going on outside for seven days,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   hashtag awkward.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And now you see where we get the seven-day honeymoon,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   where it comes from, you see where these traditions
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   come from, but that's not what I'm trying
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   to tell you right now, do you see,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   when Jesus says, I'm going to my father's house
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   to prepare a room for you,
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   he's saying something so much more than what you think.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   He's saying, you are my bride, the church.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   I've paid a dowry for you with my own blood
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   when I drink from this cup.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Do you see the idea, this all existed
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   way before your concept of marriage ever existed.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   When people talk about redefining marriage,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   you can't, we don't even know how to rightly define marriage.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   What it actually is, that it's all about Jesus.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Piper says it this way, John Piper,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   marriage is temporary, not meaning that you can undo it
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   with divorce, but that it doesn't exist in heaven
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   to each other.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   That marriage is just a picture.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And it will finally give way to the relationship
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   to which it was pointing all along, Christ and the church,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   the way a picture is no longer needed
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   when you see face to face.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Like when I've been gone for a while,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   overseas or on a trip, and I get home
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   and my wife greets me in the airport,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   I don't just keep staring at her picture.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   No, I throw the picture out and I grab her and I embrace her.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   You know, it's like that's the real thing.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And marriage is just preparing you for the real thing.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   All about Jesus, that's the truth.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Pastor told my wife and I before we got married,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   he just said, he saw that we were a mess, you know,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   doing our premarital counseling, he said,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   you guys, you've got to stop pursuing each other
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   and start pursuing Christ together.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   And we said stop pursuing each other,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   he drew this picture of us just kind of missing each other,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   like these arrows, right, of us just kind of
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   going after each other, it was manic highs and lows,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   like I love you, I hate you, you know, will you marry me?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Like that's what it was like, and so we were just
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   kind of missing each other, and then he drew this other picture,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   he said I want you to stop pursuing each other
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   and start pursuing Christ together,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   and it was like this triangle, he says,
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   because if you pursue Christ together,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   then for the rest of your life you're just gonna grow
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   closer and closer and closer and closer and closer.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   And do you know what I thought about that?
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   You know what I thought, you say, woo,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   you know what I thought?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   I thought that is so stupid.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   I just thought that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And it was so prophetic.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   It was so true.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   He spoke those words over us,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   and I look back on that and it saved our marriage.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   It became a reality for us that as we
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   pursue Christ together, we grow closer and closer,
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   by the grace of God, been married 14 years now,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   and we're closer than we've ever been,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   both to each other and to Christ.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   That is a miracle.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   That is the work of God.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   In summary, the mandates of marriage
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   are sacrifice and submission.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   The mission of marriage is sanctification through service.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   And the mystery of marriage is it showcases the Savior.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   If you want to know what to expect in marriage,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   expect these things.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Because I know you're looking at it and you're scared.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   I know you're looking at it and you're confused.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   I know you've seen others get hurt by it.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I know you're carrying baggage.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   I mean, statistics say that in the '60s,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   seven out of 10 people in their 20s were married
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   compared to just two out of 10 today.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   For the first time in history, the average American
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   now spends more years single than married.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Divorce rate is about 50%.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   And I know you're looking at this,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   and some of you, you're like,
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   "Man, but I've made tragic mistakes, man.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   "I looked at porn last night."
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Maybe that's your story.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Listen, I know that's been my story in the past.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   I've experienced healing.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Let me tell you how.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Maybe it's the prom date,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   or maybe it's the last relationship.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   You know you're carrying those hurts with you.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   You know that you're not whole.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You don't feel whole.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   And you think, "Man, I don't want to get married
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   "because I'm just gonna mess somebody else up."
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   You know what's interesting about this is,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   oil and water, they don't mix.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   You know the two ingredients in mayonnaise,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   the two primary ingredients?
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Oil and water.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   Which is confusing because there is no amount of effort
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   that I can mix these two together.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   It's impossible.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Until you add something called an emulsifier.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Science class will tell you what an emulsifier does
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   is it takes the molecules of the oil
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   and the molecules of the water
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   and it bonds them together.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   It allows them to be mixed.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   An emulsifier in mayonnaise is eggs.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   You add eggs and the oil and the water, it mixes
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   in a way that it couldn't without the eggs.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   But I end with that to give you this hope
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   from this scripture.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Jesus is the emulsifier in relationships.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   Like the only way two sinners can come together
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   and be woven together and to get along forever
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   on this earth is to have the one who died for their sins
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   enter into that relationship and be the focus
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   of that relationship.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Am I saying that your atheist friends
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   can't be happily married?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   I'm saying that your atheist friends
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   can't even experience marriage.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   That what they have isn't really marriage.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Because marriage was created by God.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   He gets to define what it is and its purpose
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   and he says it is all about Jesus.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   And so whatever someone would experience
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   without Christ is a counterfeit version of marriage.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   It's not real true intimacy as bonded
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   through the creator Jesus.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   If you want real marriage, then today, right now,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   you put Christ at the center of everything you do
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   because marriage and this life and you
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   and every relationship you've ever had
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   is all about Jesus.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   That's the truth.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   That's marriage.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Father, would you help us believe that?
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Would you help us to take you at your word,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   to trust what you say is true,
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   to live it out according to your will?
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Would you redefine these ideas in our hearts
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   and minds that the world has placed there,
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   the prince of this air has placed there?
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Would you replace them with truths,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   with deep theologies, the mystery, as you said,
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   the mystery revealed,
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   and understanding that you sent your only son, Jesus,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   to die for our sins.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   You raised him from the dead so that we might have
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   a relationship with you forever and ever and ever.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   In his name, amen.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
