1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,080
 - All right, all right, it's fun worshiping with you guys.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,920
 How's everybody doing?

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,080
 (congregation cheering)

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,920
 I love it, I love it.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,520
 If you're just in town with us this evening,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,800
 welcome, if you're a guest with us,

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,680
 we're so glad you're here.

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,640
 Welcome to the porch.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,040
 My name's JP or Jonathan Picluda.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
 It's fun to be with you.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,560
 Tonight's a one-off, we're not in a series right now.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 We're in between.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,580
 As David said, we're gonna go into summer

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,720
 on the mountain next week, and so excited to be with you.

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,600
 I've been, my family and I, we're in Branson, Missouri.

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,120
 I was speaking at a camp there called Canicuk.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,440
 Anybody familiar with it?

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,480
 (congregation cheering)

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
 Awesome.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,180
 And so just meeting with the counselors

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,080
 and the staffers there,

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,800
 and then we were driving back from that camp

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,720
 and kind of going through,

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,200
 and so I've got the kids in the back,

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,960
 my daughter, Presley, my daughter, Finley,

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,200
 my two-and-a-half-year-old son, Weston,

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,920
 and my wife, Monica, and we get into Oklahoma,

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,280
 kind of southern Oklahoma.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,420
 We're on the home stretch.

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,340
 We're about to approach Texas soil,

32
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,580
 and my iPhone goes off.

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,440
 You know, this alert, this notification.

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,320
 At first, I think like Amber Alert or something,

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
 'cause it's my phone and Monica's phone.

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,080
 They're both going crazy, and so I look at it,

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,680
 and it says, "Tornado warning in your area

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
 "for the next 15 minutes."

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,800
 Now, I look outside the windows,

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,220
 and it's like, it looks fine.

41
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,420
 I don't see any tornadoes.

42
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,000
 I don't even see anything that remotely looks like a tornado,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
 just some red dirt, you know, that's it.

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,720
 And so I drive a little bit further,

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,320
 and it goes off again, except for now not 15 minutes,

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,840
 but the next 45 minutes,

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
 and now I see the clouds beginning to change shape,

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,540
 and my kids are interested in what,

49
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,240
 they're like, "What does your phone say?"

50
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,440
 And Weston's in the back of my tree.

51
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,600
 He's like, he just learned a new word.

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,240
 He's like, "Tornado, tornado."

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,920
 And then my daughter Finley starts crying

54
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,200
 as it begins to rain, and then sweet Presley is like,

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,760
 "Guys, we need to pray, we need to pray," which is awesome.

56
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,680
 You know, yeah, awesome.

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,680
 And so I kind of thought this through.

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,880
 I know words are important.

59
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,800
 We preach the gospel here, so I don't want to exaggerate.

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,800
 It was undoubtedly, undisputedly the hardest rain

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,920
 I've ever seen in my entire life took place.

62
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,880
 It was not drops of rain, it was sheets of rain,

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,440
 and then as we're sitting there, zero visibility,

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,560
 have to stop on the highway.

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,720
 I look out my window.

66
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,080
 I can't see the median two feet away.

67
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
 It's loud.

68
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,520
 I talk to Monica, like, "Are you okay?"

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,280
 She's like, "I think so."

70
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,400
 The kids are hysterical in the back.

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,880
 I'm like, "It's gonna be okay."

72
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,540
 They're like, "You're lying."

73
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,940
 (audience laughing)

74
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,020
 "Your phone said tornado."

75
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,780
 And then the rain turns to hail,

76
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,580
 and they're like, "Daddy, what's the noise?

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,880
 "What's the," I mean, it's like golf balls hitting us.

78
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,260
 It's like God did a ice bucket challenge

79
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,360
 on the entire state of Oklahoma,

80
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,060
 and we're sitting in there, and I'm like, "Oh no,"

81
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,380
 and then you know what?

82
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,900
 The rain lets up.

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
 It does, it lets up.

84
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
 I can see again.

85
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,540
 I begin to drive a little bit further, a little bit slower,

86
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,020
 and then the iPhone goes off again.

87
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,200
 And now the kids are like, "What does it say?

88
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,860
 "What, what, what, tell me, what, what?"

89
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,700
 Presley's like, "What?"

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,100
 She grabs it before I can read it.

91
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,900
 She's like, "What's flash flood?"

92
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,740
 (audience laughing)

93
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,620
 And so it says, "Flash flooding now in your area

94
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,380
 "for the next 30 minutes," and then it goes off again,

95
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,820
 and it stretches that 30 minutes to an hour.

96
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,320
 So this is now four, and so I'm like, "Flash floods?

97
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,660
 "Like, does that really happen?"

98
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,020
 I mean, like, you hear, like, I mean, I've heard of this.

99
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,220
 I've seen the warnings on the TV before,

100
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,720
 and so now the rain has let up.

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,460
 We're driving down the highway,

102
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,540
 and we're kind of in rural Oklahoma,

103
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,640
 and there's this gas station

104
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,260
 kind of in the middle of nowhere,

105
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,860
 and I watch as this person is pumping gas,

106
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,480
 and this wall of water consumes their vehicle

107
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,060
 over the tires up to the door handles, totaled.

108
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,700
 I see this 18-wheeler coming down this hill,

109
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,360
 which is a road but looks like a river

110
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,620
 and rapids all around his tires

111
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,300
 as these three roads/rivers meet,

112
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,580
 and there's just all of this craziness,

113
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,860
 and I see the carnage of what is flash floods.

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,700
 Luckily, we were, you know, the highway was higher,

115
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,540
 but they shut down 75, shut it down, closed.

116
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,580
 Over the bridge, we sat there for 45 minutes,

117
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,100
 southbound, northbound, couldn't go anywhere,

118
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,800
 and I was so grateful for the warning,

119
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,400
 but do you know what I did next?

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,480
 I did something maybe you've done,

121
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,360
 and I look back on it, and it was kind of foolish, right?

122
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,360
 I went into settings, general, notifications, off.

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,480
 (congregation laughing)

124
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,440
 Yeah, I turned them off.

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,000
 Now, what's interesting about that

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,880
 is if I believed like, hey, it says flash flooding,

127
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,200
 and then there's gonna be a wall of water

128
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,860
 coming down the road, going to, excuse me,

129
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,840
 if I really believed that at a heart level,

130
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,440
 like it's, you know, it says tornado,

131
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,680
 and then all of a sudden, you know,

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
 we're in fear of a tornado,

133
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,580
 I'd be walking around with that iPhone,

134
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,520
 you know, and those notifications, like, to my ear,

135
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,900
 waiting for the next one,

136
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,820
 but the problem is it's an annoyance,

137
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,600
 it's an inconvenience to me, it scares my kids, frankly,

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 and so I went and I shut that off,

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,440
 like I'm not listening anymore,

140
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,940
 and I believe there's areas of our lives

141
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,040
 where we shut off the word of God,

142
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,360
 and in those areas, we are being swept up

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
 by the current of our culture,

144
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,800
 and the reason that we've shut off the voice

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,860
 and the word of God is because we don't trust it,

146
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,160
 or it's an inconvenience, it's an annoyance

147
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,200
 to our prerogative and our agenda,

148
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,320
 and what we want to accomplish in our lives,

149
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,460
 and this says something about who we believe God is,

150
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,580
 we don't believe that he wants our best for us,

151
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,620
 better than that, his best for us,

152
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,900
 and so tonight, we're going to talk about an area

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,580
 that I believe we, Dallas and Fort Worth,

154
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,020
 and specifically the porch, and specifically young adults,

155
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,060
 have been swept up in the current of culture,

156
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,880
 and that topic is sex,

157
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,300
 so we're going to talk about not being swept up

158
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,580
 or avoiding the current of sexual sin this evening,

159
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,420
 and so if you're a guest with us,

160
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,540
 you're probably like, oh, great, you know,

161
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,820
 the priest is not gonna teach me to be celibate,

162
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,420
 you know, I brought a friend tonight, great, listen.

163
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,580
 (audience laughing)

164
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,820
 We're gonna bring, we're gonna go to the word of God,

165
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,260
 and we're gonna see what he says,

166
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,500
 and we're gonna see if we can trust it,

167
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,640
 and before we do, I want to read to you the last verse

168
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,480
 that I'm gonna cover tonight,

169
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,760
 it's verse eight in 1 Thessalonians four,

170
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,700
 before you turn there, just listen to this verse,

171
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,460
 this is the last verse I'm going to read,

172
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,500
 it says, "Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction

173
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,540
 "does not reject a human being but God."

174
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,220
 The very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.

175
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,500
 If you reject this instruction,

176
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,660
 you have shut off that notification to God,

177
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,820
 the creator of the heavens and the earth,

178
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,060
 and you said, I don't care what you say about this topic,

179
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,940
 I'm gonna do what I wanna do, whatever I feel like doing,

180
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,140
 it's up to me, not you, I got my own life,

181
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,400
 I don't need your help, God, no thanks,

182
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,980
 and you shut it off,

183
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,100
 and I love that Paul, God through Paul,

184
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,200
 makes it that clear to us,

185
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,140
 if you reject this, you reject God,

186
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,460
 you don't reject JP, you don't reject Watermark,

187
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,700
 you don't reject the porch,

188
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,600
 you don't reject some message or illustration this evening,

189
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 you reject the Holy Spirit, God's Holy Spirit,

190
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,580
 and so we, around this topic of sex,

191
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,100
 we just say stupid things,

192
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,420
 we come up with these weird theologies

193
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,300
 and these strange ideologies

194
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,500
 that we think make sense to us, and it's dumb,

195
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,100
 we say things like, you know,

196
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,260
 well, it's okay as long as you're ready,

197
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,620
 like, can I just, I've been ready since the fifth grade,

198
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,400
 (audience laughing)

199
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,380
 like, I'm ready, I'm ready right now,

200
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,660
 where's my wife, like, I'm ready, okay,

201
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,260
 I've been ready, so what does that mean,

202
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,280
 as long as you're ready, what is that, who says that?

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,260
 We say things like, have safe sex,

204
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,620
 well, the problem with that is God,

205
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,460
 the creator of the heavens and the earth,

206
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,020
 said sex outside of marriage isn't safe,

207
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,460
 and if you think it's safe,

208
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,900
 then your view of sex is really small,

209
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,140
 and the sex you're having is not God's best,

210
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,900
 because God says it's not safe, it's powerful,

211
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,040
 that it's strong, it's this thing that he created,

212
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,220
 that he invented, and if you take it out

213
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,300
 of its desired context, it creates carnage,

214
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,180
 it creates disaster, we say things like,

215
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,180
 try before you buy, okay, that sounds cool,

216
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,420
 how about buy before you try, okay,

217
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,740
 there's some wisdom there, how about,

218
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,940
 instead of try before you buy,

219
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,580
 how about you buy before you try,

220
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,100
 and then you're in a committed relationship,

221
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,220
 and then you can try for the rest of your life,

222
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,900
 you can keep trying, if it doesn't work, just keep trying,

223
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,660
 okay, just keep trying, you'll get there,

224
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,960
 one way or another, we'll figure it out, okay,

225
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,340
 and we come up with these silly rules,

226
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,260
 like, well, you know, I would, yeah,

227
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,100
 well, I would never pay for it,

228
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,200
 or I would never pay for it there,

229
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,460
 or not unless they're this old,

230
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,020
 or not unless the age gap is this big,

231
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,980
 or whatever that is, and I'm just asking you the question,

232
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,220
 who or what has the authority to tell us

233
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,280
 what is the best around this topic of sex?

234
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,060
 Like, you gotta answer that question

235
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,560
 before we go any further, who or what

236
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,580
 is the best source to determine what is okay regarding sex?

237
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,780
 And I'm just gonna give you the answer,

238
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,080
 the one who invented it,

239
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,460
 the one who thought it up

240
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,060
 in his unbelievable creativity and goodness,

241
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,020
 I think that he's the authority on it,

242
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,380
 there's nobody that knows more about sex than God,

243
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,860
 and so I believe this is probably the biggest issue among us,

244
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,940
 and I believe that we've lived in the gray,

245
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,720
 continuing to justify our sin on this topic,

246
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,860
 or finding pride in the lack thereof,

247
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,920
 and so when I chose this passage in 1 Thessalonians 4,

248
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
 if you wanna turn there,

249
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,620
 honestly, here's what was going through my head,

250
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,440
 I was coming from teaching something,

251
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,860
 I was moving towards, I'm teaching Thursday in Houston,

252
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,080
 and I had this kind of, the porch in the middle,

253
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
 and I knew I'd seen this verse,

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,640
 and I'm like, man, that seems like a great verse,

255
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,680
 the porch needs it in this season,

256
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,320
 and it'll probably be easy to teach,

257
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,480
 and whoa, I probably wrestled with this passage

258
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,080
 as much or more than any passage I've ever set before you,

259
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,920
 because there is certainly

260
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,560
 some interpretive challenges in it,

261
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,800
 and I want to make sure that I teach the truth

262
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,400
 on the word of God this evening,

263
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,000
 and so I mean, I have wrestled with the Greek words,

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 I have wrestled with the different commentaries

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,940
 on the passage, what other theologians had,

266
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,400
 I've had a team of brilliant people searching this passage,

267
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,880
 trying to make sure that we identify

268
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,160
 the truth in it this evening,

269
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,720
 and so I pray that it changes your life,

270
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
 I pray that it impacts your life

271
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,480
 if you would turn to 1 Thessalonians 4,

272
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,920
 and we're gonna look at God's will, God's way,

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,560
 and God's warning regarding sex from the scripture.

274
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,600
 God's will, God's way, and God's warning

275
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
 regarding sex from the scripture.

276
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,600
 Now, if you think DFW 2015 is a sexually charged culture,

277
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,160
 I will tell you from research

278
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,480
 that we have nothing on Thessalonica, okay?

279
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,260
 The church that Paul wrote this passage to,

280
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,520
 it was crazy sexually charged.

281
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
 There was no Christian influence there,

282
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,760
 and so there was nobody bringing morality

283
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
 around this topic of sex.

284
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 It was normal there to have orgies, okay?

285
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,240
 In fact, you could go to places like you would a gym

286
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,200
 to have an orgy if you wanted to,

287
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,760
 and it wasn't just frowned upon,

288
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,180
 it was actually, and it wasn't just allowed,

289
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,960
 it was actually encouraged.

290
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,440
 In fact, you could go to temples,

291
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,080
 say you're worshiping your God, and sleep with prostitutes,

292
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,040
 and that would be considered worship.

293
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
 Could you imagine?

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,120
 Don't imagine too long, but that's crazy, right?

295
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,440
 This is crazy, and so transvestites, normative,

296
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,120
 homosexualities, normative, pedophilia in this culture,

297
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,360
 absolutely accepted and normative,

298
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,320
 and there was no government coming around

299
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,640
 with rules for this, so it would be completely fine

300
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,240
 and normal for you to rape a slave.

301
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,080
 If you wanted to, that's your prerogative.

302
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,380
 No one's gonna say anything to you,

303
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,420
 they're just gonna applaud it in this culture.

304
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,080
 This is the culture he's writing this letter to,

305
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,720
 and so if you think, well, you're gonna give me

306
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
 some old advice, right, that's old-fashioned,

307
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,720
 no, no, no, no, we've got nothing on Thessalonica,

308
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,800
 and he is going to call Christians,

309
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,100
 those who follow Christ with God's Holy Spirit,

310
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,700
 to be set apart and to be different.

311
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,160
 Verse one.

312
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,740
 As for other matters, okay, so we're changing topics here

313
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,880
 to a brand new topic, and it stands on itself.

314
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,960
 Brothers and sisters, writing to believers,

315
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,880
 so if you're here and you don't follow Jesus,

316
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,760
 listen in, but we don't expect,

317
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,920
 I mean, you're gonna have all the sex you want,

318
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,240
 like, why wouldn't you, right?

319
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
 Now, I'm gonna give you some wisdom

320
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,680
 why I think you shouldn't, even if you don't know Jesus,

321
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,680
 but just know that these rules are for believers,

322
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,760
 those who follow Christ, and so if you're hearing,

323
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,240
 like, man, I don't follow Jesus,

324
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,680
 like, I'm just kinda searching, I get that, man,

325
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,760
 I know where you're at, welcome,

326
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,200
 we're so glad you're here, truly, sincerely.

327
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,560
 Brothers and sisters, porch,

328
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,600
 believers in Dallas and Fort Worth,

329
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,980
 we instructed you how to live in order to please God,

330
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,440
 as in fact you are living.

331
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,720
 Now, we ask you and urge you and the Lord Jesus

332
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,160
 to do this more and more, keep doing what you're doing,

333
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,960
 keep, you're doing it well, keep going, Christians.

334
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,720
 Keep going, brothers and sisters,

335
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,200
 for you know what instructions we gave you

336
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,920
 by the authority of the Lord Jesus.

337
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,280
 He's getting serious.

338
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,000
 Like, the Lord Jesus, under his authority,

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
 we've given you this instruction that it is God's will.

340
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,200
 Man, who wants to know God's will?

341
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,220
 Anybody come in here tonight, like,

342
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,520
 man, I wish I knew God's will.

343
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,960
 It is about to be black and white in the text,

344
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,240
 like, completely spelled out for you.

345
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,280
 Write it on your arm, get it tattooed,

346
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,480
 I mean, it is spelled out, here is God's will for you.

347
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,880
 It is God's will that you should be sanctified,

348
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,660
 that you should, it is God's will

349
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,380
 that you should avoid sexual immorality.

350
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,680
 Now, that's one of those words I think we can hide behind,

351
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,200
 sexual immorality, what does that mean?

352
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,520
 I'm not sexually immoral, I'm in a committed relationship.

353
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,800
 Man, we've been dating for like six months.

354
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
 It's serious, JP.

355
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
 We're probably gonna get married.

356
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
 You know, I'm trying before I buy.

357
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,560
 So, what is sexual immorality?

358
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,560
 This word, porneia here, is sex, sexual acts.

359
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,300
 Let me just read the definition I wrote down.

360
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,500
 So, again, I wanna be super careful tonight.

361
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,620
 Sexual acts with anyone you are not married to.

362
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,180
 Let me define sexual acts.

363
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,220
 Anything causing stimulation or sexual pleasure.

364
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,480
 So, let me put it all together.

365
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,660
 Anything causing stimulation or sexual pleasure

366
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,420
 with anyone you are not married to.

367
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,920
 Okay, including yourself.

368
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,540
 Okay, this is what he is talking about.

369
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,260
 Is that clear, is anybody gonna leave here confused?

370
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,460
 Well, I don't know if he's talking about premarital sex.

371
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,740
 Fornication, absolutely.

372
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:48,380
 All of that is encompassed in this word right here.

373
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,420
 It is a powerful word, it is a very specific word.

374
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
 It's a word different than adultery.

375
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,220
 It's a very specific word here.

376
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,340
 And so, he is saying this is his exhortation to believers.

377
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,180
 You know what he's saying?

378
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,580
 And it's good news.

379
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,620
 He's saying, hey guys, way to go, keep going.

380
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,420
 It's like you're running a marathon and you're growing tired

381
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,820
 and the apostle Paul is on the side of that road

382
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,580
 holding a cup of water, those little cups,

383
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,780
 you get a cup and throw it away.

384
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,140
 And he's like, keep going, you can finish.

385
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,980
 You can do this, you guys know what I'm saying?

386
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,180
 Like, I go to the, well, I go to the gym.

387
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,960
 I've been to the gym recently.

388
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,340
 And, yep, I've been there.

389
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,260
 And there's these guys, okay?

390
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,340
 We call them the circus clowns.

391
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,260
 Yeah, which is just offensive.

392
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,860
 I'm kind of realizing that right now in front of you.

393
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,220
 But we do and the reason we do is because

394
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,260
 they're the guys that take it real serious.

395
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,860
 Like, they got the lifting straps and the white powder

396
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,420
 and like, dude's on bench press and like, one dude's,

397
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,220
 you can do it, come on, you can do it,

398
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,900
 push it out, push it out, push it out.

399
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,620
 And you don't know who's working out harder,

400
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,640
 like the guy holding the bar or the guy over there,

401
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,680
 you know, and it's just like, man,

402
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,980
 you're taking this thing a little too serious.

403
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,060
 That is the encouragement the apostle Paul has for you.

404
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,180
 You can do it, come on, keep going, keep finish this race.

405
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,820
 So if you're here and you're like, man,

406
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,740
 this isn't even my struggle.

407
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,660
 Like, I caught this early on, like, I'm pure until that day.

408
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,340
 Like, awesome, this is a word for you.

409
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,380
 He's saying to keep going.

410
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,980
 So encouraged by you.

411
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,140
 Awesome job.

412
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,060
 Way to go, keep going.

413
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,740
 And then this, what is God's will?

414
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,700
 That you will be sanctified through sexual purity.

415
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,720
 From this text, the summary statement.

416
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,380
 God's will is that you will be sanctified

417
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,540
 through sexual purity, my first point this evening.

418
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,860
 That you will be sanctified through sexual purity.

419
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,020
 What does sanctified mean?

420
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,240
 It means to be set apart in holiness.

421
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,860
 That in a world that you don't belong to,

422
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,300
 a very temporary world, that you would stand out

423
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,940
 in the way that you avoid sexual immorality.

424
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,460
 And so if you're here and you're like, man, that's weird.

425
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,940
 Like, everyone around me is just kind of doing their thing.

426
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,100
 When you date and you're in a relationship,

427
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,680
 you just have sex, that's normal.

428
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,740
 God's saying, don't be normal.

429
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,780
 He's saying, hey, stand out, be sanctified.

430
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,780
 Present yourself as holy.

431
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,940
 Allow him to present you as holy

432
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,340
 by the way you're sexually pure.

433
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,460
 And so this includes what you listen to,

434
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,740
 what you watch, what you read, and of course, how you date.

435
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,020
 And the text says very plainly,

436
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,980
 there is a way to please God.

437
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,060
 Some of you are pleasing God in the way you date.

438
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
 Way to go.

439
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,660
 He's pleased, he looks down on you

440
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,700
 and he sees the way you date and he's just like,

441
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,040
 man, way to go.

442
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,780
 Keep going.

443
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,260
 Finish this race.

444
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,420
 And some of you are here asking the question,

445
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,780
 well, how far is too far?

446
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,620
 And here's the answer.

447
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,380
 You've already gone too far.

448
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,660
 In 10 years of vocational ministry,

449
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,580
 I've never had a single person ask me that question.

450
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,980
 How far is too far?

451
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,200
 That hadn't already gone too far.

452
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,120
 You're looking to justify your sin.

453
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,480
 Get married, man.

454
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,060
 That's why God made the covenant of marriage.

455
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,420
 Like we have such a false view of dating.

456
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,700
 Imagine if you were on a deserted island

457
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,580
 with nothing but this book, right?

458
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,980
 And you had to determine what marriage looks like

459
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,020
 and what dating looks like.

460
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,220
 I'm not talking about D Magazine or Cosmopolitan

461
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,380
 or anything else.

462
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
 I'm just saying this book, that's all you had.

463
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,500
 Like what conclusions would you draw?

464
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,340
 Like if we really believe this is the word of God, right?

465
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,820
 Just like that iPhone notification,

466
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,940
 we'd be like, okay, now what do I do?

467
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,580
 I wanna know your will, Father.

468
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,060
 I wanna do your will, Father.

469
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,820
 My friend, the other day I went to a wedding ceremony

470
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,260
 that the father of the bride did.

471
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,160
 And it was beautiful.

472
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,780
 It felt biblical.

473
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,540
 It was fantastic.

474
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,980
 And the father of the bride stood up there

475
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,220
 and he just expressed how encouraged he was

476
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,680
 by the way the two of them had dated.

477
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,620
 They were about to take their first kiss in public.

478
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,140
 Amazing.

479
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,980
 Amazing.

480
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,380
 I'm not saying that's your new rule.

481
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,100
 I'm just saying, man, that's incredible for them.

482
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,220
 Amazing, right?

483
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,180
 And he looked at her and he said,

484
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,380
 hey, before you go any further,

485
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,740
 I just wanna clarify something.

486
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,120
 You've never heard me say anything negative about sex.

487
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,340
 This is in the wedding ceremony.

488
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,020
 He says, that's because sex is good, because sex is God's.

489
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,320
 And you are about to free to take part.

490
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,460
 And I want you to enjoy it.

491
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,420
 And I want you to give all of yourself to him.

492
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,740
 And likewise, you all of yourself to her.

493
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,860
 That's a daddy saying that to his daughter.

494
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,180
 Awkward, a little bit, but right.

495
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
 (congregation laughing)

496
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,180
 But amazing.

497
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,100
 Amazing.

498
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,380
 And see, some of you, right,

499
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,020
 you've got the purity piece down,

500
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,580
 but you don't understand that sex is good.

501
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,420
 It's of God's.

502
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,780
 And when you go down that aisle

503
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,460
 and you get to the altar, that switch flips.

504
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,260
 And now what you have been taught

505
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,700
 has been a dangerous and powerful thing.

506
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,020
 You now have the freedom.

507
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,600
 This is the only safe sex that exists.

508
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,140
 It's a trusted sex.

509
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,540
 It's a covenant committed sex.

510
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,300
 And you have all the sex you desire

511
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,620
 and all the sex they desire.

512
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
 And that's good sex.

513
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,180
 That's God's sex.

514
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,500
 Don't you got to understand this is so important.

515
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,300
 God made sex and he made it good.

516
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,180
 It's his genius invention.

517
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,900
 He made the parts.

518
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,060
 He made the way they work.

519
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,940
 He made that get hard and that gets soft

520
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,780
 and that fit there.

521
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,600
 He did that.

522
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,580
 Is that awkward?

523
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,100
 It wasn't awkward in Eden.

524
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,400
 It's awkward because of sexual immorality.

525
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,180
 You got to understand this is God's incredible,

526
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,500
 powerful, amazing, beautiful invention.

527
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,980
 Like it's like the father, son, and the Holy Spirit

528
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,540
 are like okay, there's the two of them

529
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,700
 and we would like for them to increase the number.

530
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,540
 How do we do that?

531
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,780
 He's like well, we'll give them that and her that

532
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,660
 and they can come and do that and then they'll be babies.

533
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,780
 He's like that's cool, but let's throw in some pleasure.

534
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,060
 Good idea, Holy Spirit.

535
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,860
 Yes, pleasure.

536
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,640
 It's like that's what's going on there.

537
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,460
 This is God's incredible invention

538
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,940
 to enjoy in the context of what he says.

539
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,420
 He's the one who created everything.

540
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,820
 Who knows better than God?

541
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,900
 It's not dirty, it's not bad, it's good.

542
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,080
 No one knows more about it than him.

543
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,820
 But we grew up, we're the tips and tricks generation.

544
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,220
 So I grew up going through the grocery store aisle.

545
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,500
 I saw the Men's Health and the Maxim.

546
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,700
 I saw the Cosmo.

547
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,260
 I saw the advice on the cover of those magazines,

548
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,340
 21 ways to make her orgasm.

549
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,460
 It's the tips and tricks.

550
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,740
 Welcome to church, okay?

551
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:37,420
 And so you're like what is that really saying?

552
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,100
 21 ways to have a relationship based on the superficial

553
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,900
 fact of your desire for pleasure that is selfish

554
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,060
 so it is destined to fail.

555
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,260
 That's what it's really saying.

556
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,060
 21 ways to fail at a relationship

557
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,140
 because you based it on the wrong things and it's stupid.

558
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,060
 See, when you remove the things that God has placed

559
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,020
 in sex for it to be, all you have left is tips and tricks.

560
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,020
 And the sexual immorality of our culture

561
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,920
 has given some of you sexual anxiety.

562
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,840
 Even as a pure Christian person,

563
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,420
 I mean, even as someone committed to purity,

564
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,700
 you're thinking things, well, how will I perform

565
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,260
 and will I last long enough?

566
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,700
 And what if I take off my clothes

567
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,200
 and he doesn't think I'm hot?

568
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,080
 This is all the result of sin.

569
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,020
 Don't you hate sin?

570
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,720
 None of this would be there if sin wasn't there.

571
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,580
 And I hate that you're worried about those things.

572
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,220
 Those are the wrong things to worry about, man.

573
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,300
 That was never God's desire for you

574
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,700
 that you would be sitting around as a 20-something

575
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,040
 or a 30-something wondering how you might perform in sex.

576
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,380
 That's ludicrous and Satan's playground.

577
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,180
 Man, I hate that for you.

578
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,740
 That's not his desire.

579
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,660
 You don't understand the safe sex that God has for us.

580
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,860
 And Christians, those committed to Christ in the room,

581
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,540
 we should be sex experts.

582
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,440
 Now, I wanna clarify that I'm not talking about technique.

583
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,380
 I'm talking about the fact that we should know

584
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,300
 where it comes from and we should know what it's for

585
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
 and we should know why God designed it.

586
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,540
 We should be evangelists on this topic.

587
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,500
 Hey, sex is good.

588
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,320
 It's from God's.

589
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,580
 It has an intended purpose.

590
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,740
 You know what it is.

591
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,500
 It bonds two people together and it creates babies.

592
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,120
 That's what God made it for.

593
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,060
 And so when you take that powerful act outside of marriage,

594
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,460
 you are facing something really, really destructive.

595
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,920
 I know from experience.

596
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,120
 The other day I was talking to a friend

597
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,660
 that recently got married and we were just talking

598
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,260
 and he loves Jesus and knows the word

599
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,820
 and he just said something that caught me off guard.

600
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,020
 He said, "I don't know if I wanna have children."

601
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,860
 I was like, "What?

602
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,100
 "Why would you say that?"

603
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
 And he goes, "Because everyone who has them

604
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,580
 "just talks about how difficult they are

605
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,760
 "and talks about, you know, I talk to people

606
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,420
 "who are so excited when they're empty nesters,

607
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,500
 "when their children leave the house

608
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,020
 "and so I just don't know if I wanna have them."

609
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,180
 And it was like the Holy Spirit

610
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,300
 just gave me the words in the moment

611
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,480
 and I just said, "Who cares what everyone else says?

612
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,980
 "God says they're a blessing.

613
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,000
 "God says be fruitful and multiply.

614
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,020
 "God says blessed is the person who has them.

615
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,440
 "God says they're jewels and crowns.

616
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,260
 "I mean, God says all these amazing things about them."

617
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,740
 If we just had the word of God,

618
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,260
 I don't think you would ever say that.

619
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,380
 You would say, "I wanna have as many children as I can

620
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,320
 "and make disciples in the home

621
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,280
 "and wreck shop in the world that God has entrusted to me."

622
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,260
 And in the same way, I think on this topic of sex,

623
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,140
 we've listened to everyone but God.

624
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,400
 We've let shows and magazines and culture

625
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,400
 and books and articles influence our view of sex

626
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,460
 more than God.

627
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,420
 And even people we talk to

628
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,820
 who have these dumb fortune cookie sayings,

629
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,660
 try before you buy, right?

630
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,860
 More than God.

631
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,900
 But God made it.

632
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,720
 It's God's.

633
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,560
 It belongs to God.

634
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,060
 Why wouldn't we listen to him?

635
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,960
 So Paul writes, verse four,

636
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,300
 "That each of you should learn to control your own body

637
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,440
 "in a way that is holy and honorable."

638
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,420
 Brothers and sisters,

639
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,120
 each of you should learn to control your own body

640
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,540
 in a way that is holy and honorable,

641
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,540
 not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God.

642
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,520
 Now, if you have your Bible,

643
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,460
 I want you to circle those two words, know God.

644
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,080
 That's important in this passage.

645
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,640
 I think that's unbelievably important

646
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,040
 to understand this passage.

647
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,840
 Not in passionate lust like the pagans who do not know God.

648
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,320
 No, you know God.

649
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,840
 Because you know God, you have self-control.

650
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,620
 And so what is God's way to live out God's will?

651
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,780
 It's that, my second point,

652
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,300
 that you would avoid sexual immorality with self-control.

653
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,100
 That you would avoid sexual immorality with self-control.

654
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,540
 Now, when I hear self-control, I hear discipline.

655
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,140
 And I've really wrestled with this this week,

656
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,060
 as I told you, because often I would teach things

657
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,860
 like purity and against pornography and sexual immorality.

658
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,500
 Then I would say things like just pursue Jesus

659
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,060
 and just look at Jesus and just love Jesus.

660
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,080
 And I see that.

661
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
 I see that in the scriptures throughout and throughout.

662
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,540
 But here I see, and also wage war.

663
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,340
 I mean, do what you need to do

664
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,980
 by the power of God's Holy Spirit living in you

665
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,640
 because you know God.

666
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,420
 Take control of your own vessel, your own body,

667
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,820
 and the members of your body.

668
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,420
 Bring them under your control,

669
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,300
 which is to say bring them under his control

670
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,740
 because the fruit of the Spirit, okay,

671
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,180
 the fruit of the believer who has the Holy Spirit

672
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,460
 living inside of them is what?

673
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,140
 Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

674
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,940
 gentleness, faithfulness, and what?

675
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,500
 Self-control.

676
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,820
 The Spirit of God produces self-control in your life.

677
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,660
 And so if you're in a place where you're like,

678
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
 "Man, you just don't understand, I can't."

679
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,380
 What you're saying is you just don't understand God can't.

680
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,400
 God can't.

681
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,900
 No, no, no, he can.

682
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,700
 I assure you he can.

683
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,740
 And so like we, people ask questions

684
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,420
 like is masturbation a sin?

685
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,500
 Which was a huge struggle of mine.

686
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,560
 I mean, owned my life for a number of years.

687
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,260
 And I remember a friend told me, he said,

688
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,500
 "Hey," this was his advice, he was a pastor,

689
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,100
 a trusted advisor of the scriptures,

690
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,660
 and he says, "Man, if you can do that

691
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,820
 "in a way that is holy and honorable,"

692
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,780
 he's like, "Knock yourself out."

693
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,080
 I remember I was like, "Really?

694
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,140
 "That's good, so you serious?"

695
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,200
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, man, man,

696
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,100
 "if you can go and do that by yourself

697
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,640
 "in a way that's holy and honorable,

698
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
 "yeah, go ahead, but if you can't, don't.

699
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,500
 "If you can't do it in a way that's holy and honorable,

700
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 "stop it, 'cause it doesn't honor the Lord."

701
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,700
 And you're not living, you're not learning

702
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,340
 to control your body in a way that's holy and honorable.

703
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,980
 You're giving in to the passionate lust like pagans.

704
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,400
 Don't do that.

705
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,580
 Yield to his spirit living inside of you.

706
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,320
 Beg him for help, you do whatever it takes,

707
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,000
 Jesus says in Matthew five.

708
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,440
 Interesting that he says regarding the topic of lust

709
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
 that if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off,

710
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,360
 which I believe is relevant to the topic at hand.

711
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,420
 And if you're here and you don't think

712
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,400
 masturbation is wrong,

713
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,560
 then I would encourage you to fast from it.

714
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,240
 What do you mean, fast from it?

715
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,520
 Well, the scriptures encourage us to fast

716
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,760
 from the things that we desire,

717
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,040
 and so fast from that, for how long?

718
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,580
 I don't know, a year?

719
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,420
 Well, I can't.

720
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,640
 Oh, you're mastered by it.

721
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,600
 And now you're in violation of 1 Corinthians 6:12.

722
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,300
 You've been mastered by something.

723
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:56,080
 The scripture says there is someone

724
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,940
 who gives into lustful desires.

725
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,740
 It says it's the pagans, the ones who don't know God.

726
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,600
 I don't believe that this is simply saying

727
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,960
 that if you know God, you are not sexually immoral.

728
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,640
 I think it is actually saying that the secret

729
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,360
 to controlling your body in a way

730
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,900
 that is holy and honorable is knowing God.

731
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,120
 I pick on the men often.

732
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,720
 Ladies, let me talk with you for a second.

733
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,820
 This includes modesty.

734
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,600
 Oh, here we go.

735
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,720
 Pastor man's gonna tell me,

736
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,040
 you be careful what you wear.

737
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,160
 Yes, I am, because the scripture does.

738
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,280
 It says dress modestly.

739
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,040
 And so if you dress to be sexy, okay,

740
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,020
 even if you don't do it for a guy,

741
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,580
 even if you do it, well, it just makes me feel good.

742
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,040
 I like the way I look in the mirror.

743
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
 I didn't do it for him, right?

744
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,600
 And you realize that those guys are giving you attention

745
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,840
 because of the way you dress,

746
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
 and that attention feeds the way you dress.

747
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,760
 Can I just tell you what's behind that attention?

748
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,360
 Like, I'm a guy, in case you didn't know, I'm a guy.

749
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,800
 And what we're doing, when we take notice to you

750
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,200
 because you dressed sexy, is we're undressing you.

751
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,800
 We're picturing you naked.

752
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 And with some of you, that's not very difficult.

753
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,080
 It's like, just turn the pants to beige,

754
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,320
 and you're naked, right?

755
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,200
 And I'm not trying to be grotesque

756
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,760
 or just say crazy things up here.

757
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,920
 I'm just telling you the truth.

758
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,960
 I mean, you know, I was gonna say, ask a guy.

759
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,100
 Maybe don't do that.

760
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,760
 Just take my word for it.

761
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,120
 No, here's the deal.

762
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,400
 That's what's going on.

763
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,280
 And if you attract a guy with your body,

764
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,600
 you're gonna lose him for your body.

765
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,660
 And by the way, your body's gonna change.

766
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,040
 It's gonna wither.

767
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,200
 The scriptures tell us.

768
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,640
 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is fleeting.

769
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,500
 And so instead of pursuing being sexy,

770
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,560
 which is just cheap beauty, it's a shortcut to beauty,

771
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,240
 pursue being beautiful and having character,

772
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,480
 because character doesn't fade.

773
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,760
 Character lasts long.

774
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,200
 And for gentlemen, character is an amazing investment,

775
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,560
 the scripture says, the book of wisdom says.

776
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,140
 So pursue character, not being sexy.

777
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,620
 If you want a scripture, 1 Timothy 2, verse nine.

778
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:17,200
 See, Christians do not, this is what the text is saying.

779
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
 Christians do not do whatever they feel like.

780
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,640
 And this is actually evidence that we're Christian.

781
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,240
 We're not mastered by our desires,

782
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,740
 we're mastered by our creator.

783
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:32,720
 I went an entire year with fasting from desserts.

784
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,480
 If you were thinking something else, it was desserts.

785
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,040
 I went an entire year fasting from desserts.

786
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,720
 That was just up Mother's Day, okay?

787
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,040
 And so for a whole year, I didn't eat any desserts.

788
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,320
 Now, this is really difficult for me, why?

789
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,200
 Because I love desserts, okay?

790
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,280
 I love any kind of candy, all sorts of sweet things.

791
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,120
 That is definitely a vice of mine.

792
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,960
 And so after I was finished with the fast

793
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
 and I could eat desserts, again,

794
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,200
 a guy in my community group bought Krispy Kremes

795
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,080
 over to our time.

796
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,760
 And so the guy we're meeting, he had Krispy Kremes.

797
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,680
 And so I had one, okay?

798
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,520
 And I had the chocolate one filled with icing,

799
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,040
 not Boston cream, but icing.

800
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,280
 You can only get at Krispy Kreme

801
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,040
 because it's basically like lard and sugar.

802
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,920
 And so I had, it was amazing, like unbelievably amazing.

803
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,280
 And then there were two others there

804
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,360
 and they were just like staring at me, like calling me.

805
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,320
 And it was like, and it was right,

806
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,560
 the box was right in front of me.

807
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,400
 And I was sitting there and I was like sweating.

808
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,200
 And I was like, "Hey, anybody want these, please?"

809
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,320
 You know, and the guys were like, "No, man, we're full."

810
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,760
 And like, I wasn't full.

811
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,440
 And like, if I'm honest with you,

812
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,640
 like all my life, like I just eat until I'm full.

813
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,280
 Like, I'm like, if it's there and it tastes good,

814
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,120
 you know, why not?

815
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,720
 Why wouldn't I do that?

816
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,880
 I mean, any other time, any other season of my life,

817
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,800
 there's two Krispy Kremes left.

818
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,280
 Like, I just take them down.

819
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,360
 But this time, because I had gone a year without,

820
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,560
 I had the self-control to close the box and push it away.

821
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,000
 And this is what God is calling you to

822
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,480
 regarding the topic of controlling your body

823
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
 in a way that is holy and honorable.

824
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,880
 It says in the scripture, I don't want you to miss it.

825
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,760
 It says, "Learn to be self-controlled."

826
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,240
 Or it says, "Learn to control your body."

827
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,280
 It's something you have to learn because you know God.

828
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,880
 Discipline, practice, try, but also yield

829
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,640
 to his spirit living inside of you

830
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,080
 who produces self-control.

831
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,720
 And so I will just tell you this as an exhortation.

832
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,440
 A person who will pursue physical intimacy

833
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,500
 with you outside of marriage is a person who is committed

834
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,760
 to pursuing physical intimacy outside of marriage.

835
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,600
 Let me say that again.

836
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,000
 A person who will pursue physical intimacy with you

837
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,080
 outside of marriage is a person who is telling you,

838
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,640
 hey guy, just as a heads up,

839
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,040
 I'm committed to pursuing physical intimacy

840
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,880
 outside of marriage.

841
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,320
 And I know, 'cause I've done this for a while,

842
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,160
 that you're like, no, no, no,

843
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,000
 but we have something special and I'm special

844
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,560
 and I'm his lovey and he's my whatever.

845
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,020
 And so like, it's special and I, yeah, it's not special.

846
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,440
 Okay, I just wanna break the news for you.

847
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,160
 Sex outside of marriage is not like sex inside marriage.

848
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,200
 Now I know, mind blown.

849
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,040
 So let me say that again.

850
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,860
 You're not even following me.

851
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
 You're like, what did he just say?

852
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,740
 Like, wah, wah, wah.

853
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,860
 Sex outside of marriage is different

854
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,180
 than sex inside of marriage.

855
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,100
 I can't explain it, it just is.

856
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,460
 I know from experience and I know from hundreds

857
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,940
 and hundreds and hundreds of people coming into my office

858
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,500
 for marital counseling or premarital counseling,

859
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,300
 it's just different.

860
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,020
 And so if you grow fond of sex outside of marriage,

861
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,900
 you're gonna find that sex inside of marriage

862
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,380
 is just a little bit different.

863
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,820
 And if you want that, you gotta go outside of your marriage

864
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,660
 to get that.

865
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,900
 And can I just tell you, just be cautious.

866
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,340
 Like, unless you're here and you're like,

867
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,180
 no, man, I don't care if he has an affair,

868
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,460
 it's no big deal.

869
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,660
 Like, if that's you, okay, you probably don't know God

870
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,060
 and we're glad you're here.

871
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,480
 (congregation laughing)

872
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,700
 And so you're just here, you're like,

873
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,500
 hey, how do I avoid sexual immorality in a relationship?

874
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,020
 1 Corinthians 6:18 says, "Flee."

875
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,860
 Flee what?

876
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,680
 Flee sexual immorality.

877
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,520
 How do I know if it's sexually immoral?

878
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,060
 If your body is preparing itself for sex, you flee.

879
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,540
 And dudes are like, well, when she holds my hand,

880
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,220
 like, my body is preparing itself.

881
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,060
 Okay, flee.

882
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,300
 All right, whatever.

883
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,380
 Like, here's the way I explain it.

884
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,260
 You ever been to the airport?

885
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,320
 Yes, you have.

886
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,260
 There is a moving sidewalk there.

887
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,180
 You ever seen these?

888
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,580
 They're genius.

889
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,780
 Like, they take you from one place to another quickly.

890
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,420
 You can walk on them and it's like you're running.

891
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,300
 It's amazing.

892
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,780
 Have you seen the moving sidewalks?

893
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,000
 It's like escalators, but they're flat.

894
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,140
 Amazing.

895
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,980
 And so once you get on that, right,

896
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,300
 it's taking you down a path.

897
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,140
 And the only way to stop is to jump off of that.

898
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,060
 Likewise, when you are engaged in sexual intimacy,

899
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,140
 you are traveling down a path.

900
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,940
 That path ends in sex, okay?

901
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,540
 And the only way to stop that

902
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:58,180
 is to get off of that moving sidewalk,

903
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,420
 to get off of that path.

904
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,380
 And so if you're here, you're like,

905
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,040
 yeah, as soon as she holds my hand,

906
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,740
 like, you know, we're moving down that path.

907
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,860
 Cool, don't hold hands.

908
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,220
 Get married and hold hands as much as you want or more.

909
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,460
 You know, do whatever you want in marriage, right?

910
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,340
 It's free game, right?

911
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,100
 Keep the marriage bed undefiled, the scriptures say,

912
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,900
 but have fun.

913
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,700
 Be like, wait a minute, what, are you serious?

914
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,780
 Like, what are you saying for me?

915
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,660
 I don't know where the line is for you.

916
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,500
 You do.

917
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,820
 It's probably before you think it is.

918
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,220
 I wouldn't get close to the line.

919
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,140
 I wouldn't step on the sidewalk.

920
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
 Why?

921
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,900
 Because it's unloving to tell somebody you care about

922
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,340
 that I'm gonna take you on a path

923
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,140
 that's not gonna satisfy you tonight.

924
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,680
 There's nothing loving about that.

925
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,540
 That is not God's intention.

926
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,100
 And you're like, dude, but you don't even, man,

927
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,420
 we can make out and we're not going down that path.

928
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,020
 There's something wrong with you.

929
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,940
 Get therapy is what I would say.

930
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,260
 That's not God's design.

931
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,060
 That's not God's intention.

932
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,780
 You should not be able to make out with someone

933
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,100
 and not have your body be prepared for sex.

934
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,740
 That should not be.

935
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,520
 And if that's the case, like, let's talk.

936
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,540
 I'll refer you to somebody.

937
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,280
 Like, we'll help you or something.

938
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,680
 But it shouldn't be.

939
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,380
 All right.

940
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,140
 How someone handles their sexual cravings

941
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,700
 will show you the God they worship.

942
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,820
 Let's go, verse six.

943
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,140
 It's about to get difficult.

944
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,020
 In that in this matter, no one should wrong

945
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,060
 or take advantage of a brother or sister.

946
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,220
 The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins.

947
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,380
 As we told you and warned you before.

948
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,280
 For God did not call us to be impure,

949
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,660
 but to live a holy life.

950
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,320
 Now I didn't write that passage.

951
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,560
 The Holy Spirit did through the apostle Paul.

952
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,640
 I wanna read it again

953
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,520
 'cause there's obvious interpreted challenge in there.

954
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,160
 And in this matter, no one should wrong

955
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,760
 or take advantage of a brother or sister.

956
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,720
 The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins.

957
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,900
 As we told you and warned you before,

958
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,820
 for God did not call us to be impure,

959
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,960
 but to live a holy life.

960
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,200
 And so this is God's warning.

961
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,360
 My third and final point is sexual sin is never safe.

962
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,720
 Sexual sin is never safe.

963
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,680
 I have wrestled with this text

964
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,520
 as much as I've wrestled with any text.

965
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
 What does punish mean there?

966
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,360
 What does it mean?

967
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,180
 What does it mean?

968
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,320
 How do I reconcile that with Romans 8, 1?

969
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,120
 There's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ.

970
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,040
 And say, Gideon's five,

971
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,200
 that he's no longer counting our sins against us.

972
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,460
 It's written to believers.

973
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,380
 What is he talking about?

974
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,280
 How does God punish believers?

975
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,360
 And so I've wrestled with it.

976
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,320
 I believe I have clarity.

977
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,400
 And I wanna tell you what it means.

978
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,120
 When it says the Lord is going to punish

979
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,120
 those who commit these things,

980
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
 this is what it means.

981
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,880
 It means he's going to punish them.

982
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,920
 In Hebrews 12, it talks about the Lord

983
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,920
 disciplining his children because he loves them.

984
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,440
 And so you might be like,

985
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,080
 well, does that discipline look like him

986
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,880
 intentionally moving towards me,

987
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,920
 reactively disciplining me?

988
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,800
 Does it look like a natural consequence,

989
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,080
 like an STD or an unwanted child?

990
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,000
 Does it look like something reactionary

991
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,080
 because of what I've done?

992
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,040
 And as best and most honestly as I can answer you,

993
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,880
 yes.

994
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,440
 Any and all of those things.

995
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,480
 It's in this life.

996
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,080
 If you have trusted in Christ

997
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,400
 and you're a follower of Jesus,

998
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,800
 you believe that he has died for your sins,

999
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,760
 in eternity, you are with God.

1000
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,600
 That's the good.

1001
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,320
 His grace has saved you through the faith you have in him,

1002
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,960
 you believing upon him,

1003
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
 that he's paid the price for your sins.

1004
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,780
 You're gonna be with him forever and ever.

1005
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,360
 But if you leave this room

1006
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,320
 and you engage in sexual sin,

1007
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,840
 this scripture says the Lord is gonna punish you.

1008
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,600
 And I can't tell you how many times

1009
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,120
 like I have talked to believers,

1010
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,720
 followers of Jesus that were so committed to Christ.

1011
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,160
 They're like, dude, we had sex one time

1012
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,800
 and like one time and she got pregnant.

1013
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,080
 Like why?

1014
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,120
 Like, 'cause God loves you and he's merciful to you.

1015
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,000
 And because he loved you,

1016
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280
 he spared you, you getting away with that

1017
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,040
 without any cost or anything difficult.

1018
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,960
 And so now you have a beautiful child to love

1019
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,940
 or to give toward adoption.

1020
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,600
 And that was God's mercy to you,

1021
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,920
 to show you that he is involved in your life

1022
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,280
 and that he does not want you to go down

1023
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
 the slippery slope of sexual sin.

1024
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,180
 I have talked to people like, bro, I lived,

1025
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,120
 I never even kissed a girl.

1026
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,280
 And one night I had a little too much to drink,

1027
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,760
 I had sex and I caught an STD.

1028
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,880
 They said, why?

1029
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,900
 'Cause God loves you and he's merciful.

1030
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,360
 And he does not want you to go down the slippery slope

1031
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,680
 of sexual addiction.

1032
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,920
 Frankly, like I did.

1033
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,760
 As a pagan, I got away with it.

1034
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
 So I thought.

1035
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,280
 So I thought and then I got into marriage

1036
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,320
 and realized I had no idea how to love a woman

1037
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,240
 in a monogamous committed relationship

1038
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,760
 because all my life I had been in relationship

1039
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,960
 to relationship to relationship to relationship.

1040
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,880
 I had broken the bonding that God had wired me toward.

1041
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,100
 I had bonded to a variety, not just of live women,

1042
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,560
 but thousands of pornographic images.

1043
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,800
 And now I'm in a marriage and one woman,

1044
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,320
 frankly, won't satisfy me.

1045
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,440
 I've got to learn by the power of God's spirit in me,

1046
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,840
 self-control.

1047
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,900
 And it was a task and it took an army of people

1048
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,680
 called community holding me accountable

1049
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,800
 and me yielding every step of the way

1050
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,500
 to his spirit living inside of me by his grace.

1051
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,160
 (silence)

1052
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:32,120
 The NASB says the Lord is the avenger of these matters,

1053
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,960
 which is awesome.

1054
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,160
 Here's what that means.

1055
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,220
 I've got a little girl, I've got two little girls

1056
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,080
 and I joke around like I've got a gun collection.

1057
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,360
 If they ever bring a boy over, like, it's like, what's up?

1058
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,120
 But the truth, here's the truth.

1059
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,600
 Here's the reality.

1060
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,080
 What this text means, I don't have to do that.

1061
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,180
 'Cause when that guy comes over who is like I was,

1062
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,100
 I don't have to bow up and say, hey,

1063
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,340
 and let me show you my armbar.

1064
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,180
 I can just be like, hey, you don't have to be afraid of me.

1065
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,220
 Like the God who formed her in her mother's womb,

1066
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,220
 the one who spoke things into existence

1067
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,940
 says that he is the avenger of these matters.

1068
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,620
 If you want to take advantage of her,

1069
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,700
 like you deal with that God.

1070
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,200
 I was at, we were at camp a couple years ago

1071
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,660
 and Presley walked up to this little boy

1072
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,180
 and she was like, it was really cute.

1073
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,380
 And she was like, hi, do you want to play with me?

1074
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,660
 And he looked at her and he kind of stepped back

1075
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,440
 and he goes, boom, and he threw her on the ground.

1076
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,340
 And I saw it.

1077
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,540
 And it was almost a homicide.

1078
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,380
 (congregation laughing)

1079
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:40,380
 I mean, I can tell you, I remember feeling complete rage.

1080
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,180
 I mean, I'm looking at this little kid, I'm like,

1081
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,520
 oh, somebody come, oh.

1082
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,080
 And like, she's on the ground.

1083
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,680
 Like for a second, I thought she was unconscious.

1084
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,800
 Like she's just lying there

1085
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,680
 and she's kind of that quiet cry, you know?

1086
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,360
 And like, she's crying, but hysterical,

1087
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,360
 nothing's coming out kind of thing.

1088
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,920
 And I'm just like, bro, call your mama right now.

1089
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,080
 Like something, man.

1090
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,820
 And so, and I was telling Todd that this week,

1091
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,680
 Todd is the senior pastor here.

1092
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,880
 And he just, he reminded me, he's like,

1093
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,120
 hey, that's like what the Lord feels

1094
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,420
 when someone takes advantage of his daughters.

1095
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,800
 And I knew I was gonna tell you that tonight.

1096
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,760
 Now, let me tell you what happened to me last night.

1097
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,680
 We were at dinner.

1098
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,140
 Weston, my two and a half year old,

1099
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,660
 walks up to a little girl and throws her on the ground.

1100
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,080
 And I saw it.

1101
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,480
 Now I'm on the other side of it.

1102
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,340
 It's my son.

1103
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:40,120
 And I'm like, I grab him and I take him outside

1104
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,020
 and I take him in my truck and I sit him down.

1105
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,380
 He's like, no, daddy, no, daddy, I don't need a spanking.

1106
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,880
 I'm like, oh yeah, you do, bud.

1107
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,980
 (congregation laughing)

1108
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,500
 And listen, I want you to hear what I said.

1109
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,060
 I said, for the rest of your life,

1110
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,180
 until the day you die, you never put your hands on a woman.

1111
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,740
 I said, let me tell you something.

1112
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,740
 God made you to protect them and to care for them

1113
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:07,260
 and to provide for them.

1114
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,060
 And you will never hurt a woman

1115
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,380
 until the day you die physically or emotionally.

1116
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,660
 And now you're about to experience pain.

1117
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,720
 (congregation laughing)

1118
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,420
 And it's because of what you did.

1119
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,660
 And ladies and gentlemen, this is what God is saying to you.

1120
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,460
 It sounds like fear mongering.

1121
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,780
 I know, the text is scary.

1122
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,600
 Scared me.

1123
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,560
 This is what God is saying.

1124
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:45,960
 Some of you, you're here and the truth is

1125
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,260
 God's not gonna discipline you in this life.

1126
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,200
 He's gonna discipline you in the next.

1127
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,180
 You don't know him.

1128
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,120
 And you're not battling sexual sin.

1129
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,900
 You're not fighting it.

1130
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,360
 You've just completely given way to it.

1131
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,720
 You've made up your own rules.

1132
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,600
 You've forsaken the word of God.

1133
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,200
 You've come up with your own rules.

1134
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,960
 And I'm begging you with any credibility

1135
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,160
 that somehow the Lord in his mercy has you here tonight,

1136
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,120
 maybe you think I have some sort of credibility on that.

1137
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:19,080
 I'm begging you to repent and to turn to Jesus.

1138
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,560
 He's big enough to wipe away those sins.

1139
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,960
 He's big enough to make you a new creation.

1140
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,360
 I'm not saying anything crazy,

1141
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,640
 like you're gonna be a virgin again

1142
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,180
 or anything like that, okay?

1143
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,280
 I'm just saying that he will pay for those sins

1144
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,120
 on the cross so that you don't have to pay

1145
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,240
 for your sins in hell.

1146
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,920
 But if you do not repent, you will pay

1147
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,820
 for your sins in hell.

1148
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,800
 If you do not trust in Christ for the forgiveness

1149
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,720
 of what you've done to God's brothers and sister,

1150
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,780
 or God's sons and daughters, I'm begging you.

1151
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,880
 I truly, truly am.

1152
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,640
 And so if I can clarify that more,

1153
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,920
 you say, "Hey, why did you get on your knees?

1154
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,100
 "Why did you plead with me in that way?"

1155
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,600
 I'd love personally to have that conversation with you.

1156
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,040
 And so to the believer who is here

1157
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,400
 and waging war in the battle, I'm so encouraged by you.

1158
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,720
 Keep going, stay strong, finish the race.

1159
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,840
 And to the believer who is here who is losing the battle,

1160
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,600
 you're trying to fight, but you keep like a dog

1161
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,000
 to his vomit, returning to that,

1162
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,760
 which wants to bring destruction to your life.

1163
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,360
 Beg for help, scream for help, okay?

1164
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,600
 Come up afterwards, there'll be a team of people

1165
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,440
 ready to help you.

1166
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,040
 We would email whatever you need to do to get help.

1167
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
 We wanna help you.

1168
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,960
 And to the person who is overwhelmed with guilt

1169
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,480
 from past sexual sin, I know you're here, listen.

1170
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,080
 Okay, would you lean in right now?

1171
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,700
 I wanna talk to you for a second.

1172
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,000
 You're here and you're like thinking back

1173
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,840
 and you just heard the Lord's gonna punish you

1174
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,780
 and you're like, "Oh," and you're just like,

1175
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,180
 "I can't believe," and maybe you have

1176
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,840
 some of those things I mentioned.

1177
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,340
 That's where you cling to Romans 8, 1

1178
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,280
 and 2 Corinthians 5.

1179
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,920
 And I want you to remember, now listen,

1180
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,700
 remember the one who wrote this text murdered Christians.

1181
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,560
 And that's probably worse than whatever you've done.

1182
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,000
 And the one who gave this sermon was a sex addict

1183
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 and a porn addict and was often in strip clubs

1184
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,880
 and did terrible, terrible things to women,

1185
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,080
 was an abuser and was emotionally abusive to women.

1186
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,400
 That's who's given this message.

1187
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,160
 I've received the grace of Christ and so should you.

1188
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,160
 And so should you.

1189
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,200
 He is big enough to set you free from that sin.

1190
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,160
 You say, "Well, what about God's punishment?"

1191
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,040
 Okay, if you've repented, then move on

1192
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,680
 and receive the grace of God.

1193
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,500
 Now, if there's a consequence that you know

1194
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,460
 that you're living with, that's the fallen world

1195
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,100
 that we live in, but God's going to make it okay

1196
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,040
 at the end of this race.

1197
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,640
 Shame is from Satan.

1198
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,620
 God has set you free.

1199
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,860
 And to the person who will continue in sexual immorality,

1200
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:07,960
 I will do just about anything within my power

1201
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,520
 and authority to help you stop.

1202
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,740
 Please repent and receive Christ.

1203
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,200
 And so in summary, God's will is sanctification

1204
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,340
 through sexual purity.

1205
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,360
 God's way is avoiding sexual immorality

1206
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,580
 through self-control.

1207
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:31,000
 And God's warning is the serious consequence of sexual sin.

1208
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,260
 There is no safe sex or sexual immorality.

1209
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,640
 I read an article this morning that reminded me

1210
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,940
 of something maybe you saw in the news or heard about.

1211
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,320
 It was a family that was on vacation in Wimberley, Texas,

1212
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,620
 which was where we went on vacation when I was little.

1213
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:52,300
 And a flash flood came and swept away their house

1214
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,640
 and their house was floating down the river

1215
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,880
 and the mom calls her sister and says goodbye.

1216
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,240
 And as far as we know, they've all passed away

1217
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,720
 except for the father.

1218
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,560
 It's a terrible thing.

1219
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,120
 I say that not to make light of the situation,

1220
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,280
 really to ask you to pray for him

1221
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,260
 and for those that mourn that family.

1222
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,800
 But it reminded me of something.

1223
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,920
 When I was 17 years old in my small town that I grew up in,

1224
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,700
 my house was 100 yards from the Guadalupe River.

1225
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,620
 And on a sunny day, I was sitting there,

1226
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,760
 everything looked fine and right in the world,

1227
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,240
 and my dad ran in.

1228
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,440
 Now my dad is just like,

1229
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,200
 he's not super like emotionally expressive,

1230
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,520
 you know, unless something has caused him to be.

1231
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,680
 I've never known, he's a very moral person.

1232
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,280
 I've never known to lie or exaggerate or stretch the truth.

1233
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,280
 And he runs in the house and he just yells,

1234
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,200
 "We've gotta get out of here."

1235
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
 And I like come out of my room,

1236
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,320
 and I'm like, "What are you talking about?"

1237
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,900
 He's like, "We've gotta get out, the river's coming up.

1238
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,440
 "We've gotta get to the other side of the bridge."

1239
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,320
 I had lived there for 17 years.

1240
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,840
 Our house had never flooded.

1241
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,440
 The river never came anywhere close to our house.

1242
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,280
 And so I'm sitting there, I'm like,

1243
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,040
 "Dad, you've lost your mind, it's not even raining.

1244
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,460
 "Like the sun is shining, you know,

1245
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,960
 "what are you talking about?"

1246
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,760
 And so I go in my room and I'm thinking,

1247
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,960
 I'm like, "But I can trust my dad."

1248
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,920
 You know, he's never said anything crazy before.

1249
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,480
 I grab some stuff and I go and I get in my car,

1250
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,520
 at 17 years old, and I'm driving

1251
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,680
 to the other side of the bridge, just as he told me to.

1252
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,320
 And I like don't really know where I'm gonna go

1253
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,280
 or what I'm gonna do,

1254
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,240
 but I'm just kind of doing what my dad said.

1255
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,840
 And as I get to the bridge, I see a car float by.

1256
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,880
 And I realized that the river,

1257
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,080
 because of rains up north, was coming.

1258
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,080
 There was a wall of water coming.

1259
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,880
 And that was the last time I saw my house in eight days.

1260
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,280
 And when we returned to it, everything had been destroyed.

1261
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,040
 And I realized that I can trust my dad.

1262
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,020
 My dad loves me, even when it doesn't make sense to me.

1263
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,400
 Even when it goes against what I feel and what I see

1264
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,920
 and the world around me, I can trust my dad.

1265
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,240
 And I want you to know you can trust

1266
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,040
 your heavenly father even more.

1267
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,160
 He wants to give you good things.

1268
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,000
 He's not trying to rip you off.

1269
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,760
 You don't have to feel ashamed.

1270
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,260
 He loves you and he's moving towards you

1271
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,640
 like a loving father.

1272
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,400
 Yield to him.

1273
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,240
 Let me pray.

1274
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,240
 (prayer)

1275
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,280
 Father, draw near to us as we sing this last song.

1276
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,520
 Move in our hearts and strengthen us

1277
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,280
 by the power of your Holy Spirit, because we know you.

1278
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,480
 My friends that don't know you, God,

1279
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
 would you introduce yourself to them,

1280
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,180
 even as we sing this song?

1281
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,760
 Show them what you've done for them through Jesus Christ,

1282
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,520
 your only son, who you allowed to die on our behalf

1283
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,200
 because we've been sexually immoral

1284
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,200
 and sexually perverted and sexually messed up.

1285
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,800
 Terrible things we've taken part in or have happened to us.

1286
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,920
 God, we need your remaking, your rebuilding,

1287
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,800
 your renewing, and to the Christian in the room,

1288
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,880
 Lord, would you spur them on?

1289
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,740
 We are thirsty for you, God.

1290
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,560
 We want more of you, God.

1291
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
 We want to know you, God.

1292
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:25,560
