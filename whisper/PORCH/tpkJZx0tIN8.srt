 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,840
 >> All right. What's up everybody in the room,

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,800
 everybody tuning in online in particular?

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,120
 The rowdy crew over here.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,240
 I want to welcome PortsLive locations everywhere in

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,360
 particular Fort Worth, Austin, Texas, greater Lafayette,

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,600
 Indianapolis, Midland, Texas, every PortsLive location.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,280
 We are starting a brand new series tonight that I am so

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,880
 excited about, and it will be looking at the book of

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,640
 Ephesians. Now, let me bring you into something that

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,280
 happened last week in my life that will set up where I

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,080
 want to go tonight. I was on vacation with my family.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,960
 We went with my wife's family to the beach and where we

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,560
 were staying had the Cowboys training camp located there

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,160
 as well. And so one of the days I talked to my six-year-old

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,080
 son and my four-year-old daughter, and I was like, the

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,840
 Dallas Cowboys are here. They're down the road. We can

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,320
 go to the training camp and go see the Dallas Cowboys. Do

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,280
 you guys want to go do that? And it's all free and they're

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,240
 going to have tons of fun stuff to do. Y'all want to go?

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,640
 And eventually by telling them there will be snow cones,

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,120
 they're like, I'm in. So we get in the car, pack up, drive

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,120
 an hour, get there and everything looks great. Get to

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,720
 the bleachers and immediately in front of us, I mean like

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,440
 50 feet away is Dallas Cowboys. It's amazing. There's

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,560
 Dak, there's Zeke, everybody. They're running two minute

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,360
 drills. I mean, here's a picture of how close you are.

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,640
 And I'm thinking, man, this is going to be a memory my

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,120
 kids remember for the rest of their life. Dad was there

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,920
 where they're watching Dallas Cowboys out in California.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
 It's just incredible. And I turned to my kids and I can

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,800
 tell, man, they are not into it at all. They are ready to

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,400
 go. My six year old. Yeah, there's my daughter who this

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,160
 is like five minutes in after she's taken my father in

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,400
 law's sunglasses and my son's taking the other pair of

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,920
 sunglasses in his hat. And they're like, it's too bright.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,400
 This is miserable. No, no, no. That's Dak. See the red

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
 jersey. That's the quarterback. You need to know him.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,560
 Watch this play. All right, man, he's running that route.

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,600
 And they're like, man, I'm so over it. When are we getting

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,880
 the snow cones? And I keep going, OK, hey, all right,

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,280
 let's watch a few more plays. And I'm trying to hype it

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,800
 up. And I'm realizing they don't know who this is.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,280
 They're like, wait, is this our team? Why are they out

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,760
 in California if they're from Dallas? And is this like

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
 do they play the Aggies or the Miami Heat? Do they play

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
 Miami Heat? I'm like, no, no, that's basketball.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,640
 And that's the NBA. This is the NFL. No, they don't play

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,560
 college teams. This is the National Football League.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,840
 And I'm like, this is going to be a memory. This is so

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,480
 exciting. And they were over it before it began.

52
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,880
 True story. I go to get snow cones because I'm like, I

53
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,640
 got to do something to redeem this. Stay with Grandpa.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,000
 Grandpa calls me five minutes later and is like, I think

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,880
 they're done. Let's get the snow cones and leave. And we

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,400
 get the snow cones and they head off. Now, in that

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,880
 scenario, one of the reasons they were not able to stay

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,720
 engaged is they didn't know what they were looking at.

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,840
 They didn't know who these people were. I can try to

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
 explain, but without having a clear understanding of,

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,120
 hey, this is who this is. It was more difficult to stay

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,160
 engaged and more difficult to connect with what was in

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,240
 front of them. Now, tonight, we're going to kick off a

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,440
 look at the book of Ephesians and my heart and hope in

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,400
 the next 45 minutes or 30 minutes is to walk through

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,800
 and help you better understand who's in front of you

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,720
 as it relates to the church in Ephesus. In other words,

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,640
 tonight, before we dive into the book, I want to give

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,200
 you the ability to understand when we talk about the

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,120
 letter to the Ephesians, it's like, oh, you know, the

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,800
 Colossians and the Galatians and the Ephesians and the

72
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,280
 ends. But who is the church in Ephesus? And what I

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,120
 want to do tonight is trace the origin and the ending

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 of the church in Ephesus to give us really a framework

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
 to understand what we're going to look at for the

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,560
 next eight to 10 weeks as we go through and journey

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,720
 through this book. The church in Ephesus is one of

78
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,720
 the most remarkable stories and churches of the

79
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,280
 ancient world and in history in general. And tonight,

80
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,880
 when we look at the story in Acts, chapter 18 and 19,

81
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,760
 we're going to see the beginning of the church and

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,200
 also how the spirit began to give clarity. On

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,320
 different types of faith. That were present in the

84
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,240
 church of Ephesus, there was a group that had a

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,600
 flawed, inaccurate faith. There was another group

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 that had a fake faith and then a final group that

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
 had a faith that brought freedom into their life, a

88
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,960
 genuine faith. And so this is going to be a tracing

89
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,440
 of the beginning and the end of the Ephesian church.

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
 And here's what you need to know about Ephesian

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,320
 church. It was located in Ephesus. Today, that's

92
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,280
 modern day Turkey. Ephesus was an amazing city. It

93
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,200
 was a port city. It was a climate very similar to

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,320
 like L.A. Here's a picture of today. If you go to

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,760
 the port of Ephesus, I mean, it's like tropical.

96
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,600
 It's amazing. It's 75 almost year round. That's

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,280
 why I say it's similar to like L.A. I mean, this

98
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,760
 is a place people wanted to be back then because it

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
 was on a port. It was incredibly wealthy. This is a

100
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,320
 place you move to in order to run a business in

101
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,720
 order to have trade. You could make it in Ephesus.

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,040
 And so people flooded to the city. It was one of

103
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,760
 the most populated cities of the ancient world. It

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,800
 also was a place that had lots of worship of pagan

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,480
 gods and lots of spirituality. There were 50

106
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,840
 different gods that were worshipped inside of the

107
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,200
 city of Ephesus. And perhaps the most important

108
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,240
 iconic thing about the city is located inside of

109
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,360
 the city was one of the seven wonders of the

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
 ancient world that there were kind of seven

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,000
 things historians go like, hey, we have no idea

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,600
 how this was built. It was a marvel today. And it

113
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,240
 was a marvel to everyone who lived back then. And

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,920
 it was called the Temple of Diana or the Temple

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,680
 of Artemis, who is the goddess of fertility. This

116
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
 was a massive thing. I think we have another

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,560
 picture. There you go. This would have been a

118
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,520
 reconstruction of it back in the day, but it was

119
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,080
 400 feet wide. It was 150 feet. I'm sorry, 450

120
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
 feet long, 150 feet wide, 60 feet tall, all

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,840
 worshipping this pagan goddess. And the apostle

122
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
 Paul is going to show up and he's going to

123
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,640
 introduce into this incredibly influential city.

124
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,600
 The Christian faith and God is going to touch that

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,320
 movement in that city and in particular Paul's

126
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,840
 ministry like no other location, arguably in the

127
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,520
 entire New Testament. The apostle Paul would spend

128
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
 more time in this city than any other place that

129
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,000
 he would go. He loved the Church of Ephesus. And

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,800
 we know more about the Church of Ephesus than

131
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
 every other church in the New Testament. We know

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,440
 how it began. We know how it continued because

133
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,960
 the letters of first Timothy and second Timothy

134
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,560
 are written to Timothy, who was leading the

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,360
 church in Ephesus. The leaders of the church in

136
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,880
 Ephesus were remarkable. I mean, they had the

137
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,960
 who's who in terms of the Hall of Fame. Who's

138
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,200
 going to lead your church? Why do I say that?

139
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,720
 Well, it included the apostle Paul. It included

140
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,160
 the apostle John. It included Timothy. I mean,

141
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
 whatever church you've been to or been a part of,

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
 you have not been to anything like a church

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
 where, oh, man, your your church is led by Paul.

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,960
 Oh, man, who is Paul mentored by? Jesus. Oh,

145
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,480
 yeah. And then it was led by John. Who's John?

146
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,600
 Jesus. And God is going to do something

147
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
 remarkable inside of this city. And the message

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,160
 of its origin are as relevant to us today as

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,600
 ever. And so we're going to be in Acts chapter

150
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,440
 18 and 19. And I want to look at three aspects

151
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,840
 of this faith and answer the question or propose

152
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,520
 the question. What kind of faith do you have? What

153
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,040
 kind of faith do you have? Perhaps no question

154
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,440
 is as important as that one. In evaluating, do I

155
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
 really have a true faith that's going to impact

156
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,440
 my eternity? What kind of faith do I have? So

157
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 this starts in Acts chapter 18. Pick it up in

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,640
 verse 24. OK. Big fan of the number 24.

159
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:26,120
 Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, a native of

160
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,400
 Alexandria, came to Ephesus. So the book of Acts

161
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,480
 is the story of the early church. So it traces

162
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,680
 Paul's journey. It traces kind of after Jesus

163
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,040
 rises from the dead, the church movement. And in

164
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,400
 18, it begins to talk about Ephesus. Apollos

165
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,960
 came to Ephesus. He was a learning man, thorough

166
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,600
 knowledge of the scriptures. He'd been instructed

167
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,160
 in the way of the Lord. That's Christianity. And

168
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,760
 he spoke with great fervor and he taught about

169
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,120
 Jesus accurately, though he only knew of the

170
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,000
 baptism of John. He began to speak boldly in the

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,040
 synagogue when Priscilla and Aquila, this is a

172
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,360
 married couple. They're mentioned earlier in Acts.

173
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,560
 This is like married goals. They see him and they

174
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,760
 invite him into their home and they explain the

175
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,880
 way of God to him more adequately. So they see

176
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,400
 this guy, lots of passion, lots of energy,

177
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,920
 eloquent speaker. And he's talking about Jesus,

178
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,720
 but he doesn't fully understand it. And so

179
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,800
 Priscilla and Aquila, this married godly couple,

180
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
 they say, hey, Apollos, we're going to bring you

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,560
 over for dinner and we're going to teach you a

182
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,000
 better understanding of the gospel. And so they

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,160
 do. And then Apollos wants to go to Corinth or

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,800
 Achaia in verse 27. Apollos wanted to go to

185
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
 Achaia and the brothers and sisters, that's the

186
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
 church Christians around him, encouraged him and

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,160
 wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. When

188
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,040
 he arrived, he was a great help to those who by

189
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,040
 grace had believed. For he vigorously refuted the

190
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,200
 Jewish opponents in public debate, proving from

191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,680
 the scriptures that Jesus was the Messiah. While

192
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
 Apollos was in Corinth, so Apollos was doing that,

193
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,880
 Paul took the road through the interior and

194
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,600
 arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples

195
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 and he asked them, did you receive the Holy

196
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
 Spirit when you believed? They answered, no, we've

197
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,600
 not even heard there is a Holy Spirit. So Paul

198
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,280
 asked, then what baptism did you receive? They

199
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,160
 said John's baptism. Basically, we believed in

200
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,240
 the message that John the Baptist had preached.

201
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,160
 Paul said John's baptism was that of repentance,

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,120
 of hey, you need to stop sinning, turn from the

203
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,280
 way you've been living. But it wasn't a fulfilled

204
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,840
 gospel. It wasn't the full picture. He told the

205
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,040
 people to believe or to trust in the one coming

206
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,880
 after him, that is in Jesus. On hearing them, on

207
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,040
 hearing this, they were baptized into the name of

208
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,080
 Jesus. In other words, they trusted in Christ and

209
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,360
 understood the gospel is not just something of

210
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,200
 hey, stop doing that. It is receive Jesus as your

211
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,720
 Lord and your Savior. The first group that were

212
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
 introduced, there's two really, there's a person

213
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,440
 and then there's a group that had a flawed faith,

214
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,520
 that the Apollos had a flawed faith. We're not

215
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,360
 told exactly how he had not rightly understood

216
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,000
 the gospel, but he had what many people still

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,680
 today have. He had a flawed understanding of what

218
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,240
 the Bible actually teaches. The second group is in

219
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,520
 the same camp. It's this group that had Paul

220
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,040
 telling them, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what

221
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,800
 Jesus means and that's not what it means to even

222
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,920
 be a follower of Christ. And so he explains.

223
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,320
 Inside of this room and listening online, to

224
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,840
 some level, all of us have a flawed faith. But

225
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,720
 when it comes to having a flawed understanding

226
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,200
 of the gospel. That has ramifications that can

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,400
 impact your eternity. And Paul is trying to make

228
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,160
 sure, hey, you have an accurate understanding of

229
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,000
 who is God, of what's real, and that you address

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,640
 any flawed faith. Inside of the room today,

231
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,480
 there's still examples of flawed faith. The

232
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,520
 candle, you guys, maybe you grew up in church, you

233
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
 went through confirmation, you went to a Catholic

234
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,080
 school, you've been around Christianity a long

235
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,480
 time. Your grandma, you know, had verses on the

236
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,600
 wall and you just feel like you kind of know it.

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,960
 But you still think things that are flawed and not

238
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,280
 biblical. What do I mean? Things like God is some

239
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,560
 cosmic killjoy who's up in the sky, doesn't want

240
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,680
 anyone having fun down here, and he doesn't want

241
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,920
 you to have sex or drink or smoke or do anything

242
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,720
 that's going to be too fun because he's just in a

243
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,240
 bad mood all the time. And he is one goal in life

244
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,280
 and it is to make sure nobody has too much fun.

245
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,240
 And you wouldn't put it like that, but when you

246
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,520
 think of God, that's part of what you associate

247
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,200
 with him. Or you think that he's just some genie

248
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,680
 in the sky and really, you know, I go to him when

249
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,880
 things are hard or when I want something. It's a

250
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,360
 flawed faith. Or that he's some sheriff, distant

251
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,200
 judge, and he cares about me because he kind of

252
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,040
 loves the whole world, but he doesn't really love

253
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,880
 me. Certainly not like me, like I am.

254
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,160
 And that's a flawed faith.

255
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,160
 And the Bible calls all of us to take our lives

256
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,040
 and take the word of God and begin to go, hey,

257
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,280
 where am I believing a lie?

258
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,720
 Where am I living in a way that's not aligned

259
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,880
 with God's word? One of the gifts of having godly

260
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
 friends, relationships, community, older couples,

261
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,240
 is that just like Apollos, they can come along and

262
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
 they can go, hey, let me help you understand. It

263
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,360
 seems like you're believing this lie right now.

264
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,800
 And to address any areas of our faith that are

265
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,320
 flawed. The whole book of Ephesians is really

266
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,040
 written where the apostle Paul is trying to help

267
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,640
 them. Hey, here's what it looks like to live out

268
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,920
 your faith. Here's how you can have a better

269
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,640
 understanding of who God is. Here's what it looks

270
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,440
 like to live out your faith. And in the book, he

271
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,400
 walks through one of the clearest outlines of any

272
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,440
 book that we have. And you can break the book

273
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,720
 down into really three sections. The first three

274
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,560
 chapters all about seated or sit. You are seated

275
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,840
 in the heavenly places, sealed for eternity if

276
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,200
 you're a follower of Jesus. Then four and five

277
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
 chapters, four and five, he talks about men walk

278
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,040
 in light of the new identity, the new you. That

279
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,880
 you are in Christ. Now you walk in a manner

280
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,920
 that's consistent with that. So sit, walk. And in

281
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,280
 chapter six, now stand firm in the faith. And it

282
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,080
 really takes us on the Christian journey that

283
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,800
 begins with understanding all those things. You're

284
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,000
 seated. And I'm going to walk consistent with

285
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,240
 that. And I'm going to stand firm in my faith. And

286
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,400
 what my heart and I hope you will journey with us

287
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,600
 for the next 10 weeks is we want to help you know

288
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,840
 how to read and study God's word for yourself. To

289
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,640
 begin to self examine any areas in your life where

290
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 you are having flawed faith, a inaccurate,

291
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,080
 unbiblical perspective on life, on yourself, on

292
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,040
 God, and to address those things. You would begin

293
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,560
 to grow. That as we've said before, it is

294
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
 possible for you to grow in age. You're going to

295
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,280
 grow in age this year. You're getting older. It's

296
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,360
 a guarantee. You're 24, you're going to be 25 next

297
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,120
 year. You're 27, you're going to be 28 next year.

298
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,840
 If you're alive, I guarantee it. It's not a

299
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,200
 guarantee that you're going to grow in your faith.

300
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,600
 You're going to grow up in age, but not grow up

301
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,760
 spiritually. And Paul is saying, hey, addressing

302
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,720
 with God's word and growing spiritually in your

303
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,320
 faith. My six month old son, his name is Bear, and

304
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,640
 he recently had a milestone that he hit that I

305
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
 don't know if this is early or not. I can't

306
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,360
 honestly remember without other kids, but here's a

307
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,200
 picture of him. This is Bear. He just learned how

308
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
 to sit. Now to you, you're like, dude, I've been

309
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
 sitting my whole life. But whenever you are only

310
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,840
 six months old, like this is a big deal. He's got

311
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,240
 a head 99 percentile. So for most of his life, it's

312
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,880
 like, oh, boom. And now he can finally get to the

313
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,520
 spot where he's like stabilizing with those thick

314
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,560
 legs down there. And he's able to prop himself up,

315
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,160
 which is apparent. It's both a milestone and also

316
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
 a big win because it's kind of the first time

317
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,240
 you're like, all right, I can set you down and

318
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,960
 grab. Oh, no, he's going to fall. And before, if

319
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,120
 you step away for a second, he'd fall and now he

320
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,160
 can sit. Now, that's a milestone when you're six

321
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,200
 months old, but if he never progresses beyond

322
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,120
 sitting and he's six years old, it's not a

323
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,920
 milestone. It's a problem. And as lovingly as I can

324
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,560
 say. Some of you guys have been in church a long

325
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,840
 time. And you've been around Bible teaching. You

326
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,040
 were raised in a Christian home. And when it comes

327
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,200
 to spiritually in your faith, you have not

328
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,840
 progressed. And just like it is confusing when a

329
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,120
 six year old is not walking and taking steps in

330
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,640
 his faith. It is confusing. When a person who's

331
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,480
 been a follower of Christ for years and years and

332
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
 years is not taking steps and growing in their

333
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,920
 faith. And Paul is addressing, hey, there is a

334
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,800
 flawed perspective and the way you address that

335
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,600
 is by taking the truth from God's word. If you

336
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
 don't know how to do that, stay tuned, because we

337
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,160
 are going to journey through the verses of the

338
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,840
 book of Ephesians. So he addresses a flawed

339
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,960
 faith. And then in chapter 19, this happens.

340
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,480
 Paul spent the next two years, verse 10, teaching

341
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,480
 and proclaiming the gospel to the point that all

342
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,880
 of the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province,

343
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,120
 that's just the state of Asia, heard the word of

344
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,080
 the Lord. That's what I mean by Paul's ministry

345
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
 was supercharged. So he spends more time there

346
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,120
 than anybody else spends two years. He's going

347
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,360
 to tell everybody about the gospel to the point

348
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,400
 where the text just said there wasn't a person in

349
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,280
 the entire state who hadn't heard the message of

350
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,960
 Jesus. God just opens doors, gives favor, Paul's

351
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,160
 out sharing his faith, and he supernaturally

352
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,480
 begins to work through the Apostle Paul, verse 19,

353
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,800
 or verse 11 of chapter 19. God did extraordinary

354
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,840
 miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs

355
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,520
 and aprons that had touched him were taken to the

356
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,960
 sick and their illnesses were cured and evil

357
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,000
 spirits left them. So Paul's going around, God's

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,160
 doing amazing work, the church is growing, he's

359
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,560
 sharing the gospel, more believers are added to

360
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,960
 the group. And the word of this guy, there's a guy

361
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,560
 named Paul, he's in town and it's like crazy stuff

362
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,520
 is happening with him. He's seeing people come to

363
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,560
 know Jesus and he's sharing this message about

364
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,440
 Jesus and people's lives are being changed and

365
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,760
 like it's like demons are being cast out of

366
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
 demon-possessed people. I mean, stuff that today

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,560
 we don't even have a category for, but at that

368
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,280
 time there was a group that had heard about Paul

369
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,800
 doing this and they were like, man, that sounds

370
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,560
 awesome. I bet we could go do that. We could use

371
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,640
 the same God or use the name of Jesus. We're

372
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,000
 going to go do that. And it leads to one of the

373
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,680
 more comical, I think, interactions, honestly, in

374
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
 the New Testament. Here's where I say that or it'll

375
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,840
 make sense where I say it. Some of the Jews who

376
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,360
 went around driving out evil spirits tried to

377
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,760
 invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who

378
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,240
 were demon-possessed. They would say, in the name

379
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,520
 of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to

380
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,280
 come out. So this group acts as, again, it's

381
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,120
 telling us what happened at the time. And it

382
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,920
 tells us this story. You know, Paul is going

383
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,960
 around. People are being healed. People are

384
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,000
 having demons cast out of them that were

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,880
 demon-possessed. And this group is like, oh, man,

386
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
 that was amazing. Did you see what he did? He

387
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,240
 cast him out in the name of Jesus. Let's try

388
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
 that. And they begin to go around and go to

389
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,120
 demon-possessed people and go, hey, in the name

390
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,880
 of Jesus, who Paul preaches, come out. And they

391
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,240
 go up to a certain guy and says this. There are

392
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,200
 seven sons of Sheba, a Jewish chief priest. So

393
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,680
 there was a Jewish priest who had seven sons and

394
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,840
 they were doing this. One day, as they were going

395
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,560
 up to a possessed person and commanding them to

396
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,360
 come out, the evil spirit answered them. This is

397
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,880
 what I mean by it's like out of a Pirates of the

398
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,040
 Caribbean experience. They're commanding it and

399
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,320
 it says that the possessed man turns to them and

400
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,480
 he says, Jesus, I know. And Paul, I know about.

401
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,200
 But who are you? And the man who had the evil

402
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,760
 spirit jumped on them, overpowered them all and

403
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
 gave them such a beating that they ran out of the

404
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,920
 house naked and bleeding. You got seven guys

405
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,320
 going up saying, hey, in the name of Jesus, who

406
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,680
 Paul preaches, I command you to come out.

407
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,920
 Demon-possessed man turns, says, I know about

408
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,320
 Jesus. I've heard of this guy, Paul. I don't know

409
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,200
 who you are. And they get into a fight, seven on

410
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,880
 one. And the seven brothers fighting this one

411
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,360
 man get so beaten that they reach an all time low

412
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,240
 in terms of loss. Like some of you guys, you were

413
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,720
 in fights, you've been in fights before, fights in

414
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,680
 high school, fights and whatever. And there's a

415
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,160
 level of, man, I lost that fight. And then there's

416
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,760
 times where it's like, man, I feel like that was

417
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,320
 kind of close. I got a couple of good ones in.

418
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,840
 But when you and your six brothers get beaten so

419
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,840
 badly that you leave naked and bleeding, running

420
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,360
 out of the house, you're at a level of loss that

421
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,880
 there's very few words for in terms of who won

422
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,960
 that fight. It's not a, yeah, I had some good

423
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,520
 shots. And it's because they had a fake faith,

424
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,000
 like they claimed, in the name of Paul's God, come

425
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,760
 out. Now, most of us are not attempting to do

426
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,000
 something like that. But these were men who had

427
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
 been raised by a Jewish chief priest. They should

428
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
 have had some understanding or some faith. And

429
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,960
 they didn't even claim to know Jesus at all. They

430
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,040
 just claimed, hey, I know about him. I'm claiming

431
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,440
 Paul's relationship with Jesus. And they had a

432
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,800
 fake faith. The same is sadly true today. That in

433
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,800
 the same way that they were claiming the faith of

434
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,760
 somebody else. To be their own, many people have

435
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,720
 that same thing happening in their life right now.

436
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,520
 Like some of you guys, you've been around

437
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,280
 Christianity, like your grandma took you every

438
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,040
 Sunday to church, your mom took you Wednesday

439
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,120
 nights and you around it and your parents have a

440
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,720
 faith. You were raised and you say, I mean, I was

441
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,240
 raised in a Christian environment, but you've

442
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
 never made your faith your own. And if you were

443
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,440
 honest, which is really hard to do when it comes

444
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,280
 to examining a question like this. You have a fake

445
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,120
 faith. You've never even wondered like, hey, do I

446
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,240
 actually believe this? Do I really think that

447
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
 Jesus is who he says he is? Or am I just living

448
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,000
 off of the faith of other people that were around

449
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,680
 me? And, you know, I want to be a good person. And

450
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,040
 if I'm going to marry somebody that I want to

451
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,640
 marry, then, you know, I should claim to be a

452
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,280
 Christian. And I grew up in Dallas or I grew up in

453
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,480
 Arkansas or grew up in wherever. And it just is

454
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,600
 kind of the thing, it's cultural Christianity. And

455
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,520
 as lovingly as I can say, you have a fake faith.

456
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,600
 And that doesn't save you. And you have got one

457
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,120
 foot in the world and one foot in the party scene.

458
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,120
 And the way that Jesus commands you to date, the

459
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,720
 way that Jesus commands you to think, the way that

460
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,080
 Jesus invites you and calls you to experience life.

461
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,920
 It's something you never think about. And you got

462
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,320
 a Bible verse in your Instagram bio, but you date

463
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,080
 anything like he says to date. And could it be,

464
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,760
 and I say this is lovingly and as someone who has

465
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,120
 no vested interest other than if that's true, I

466
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,080
 want you to spend eternity with God, not eternity

467
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,840
 apart from that you have a fake faith. You don't

468
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,560
 actually have a moment where you've ever trusted

469
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,200
 in Jesus. You are my Lord and Savior. You died on

470
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,040
 the cross for my sin. Everything messed up I've

471
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,800
 ever done, everything messed up I ever will do.

472
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,920
 It's all been paid for. The Bible doesn't say good

473
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,760
 people go to heaven, bad people go to hell. It

474
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,400
 says forgiven people go to heaven. And here's how

475
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,240
 you know if you have forgiveness, you have

476
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,680
 trusted Jesus, you alone are the payment for my

477
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,320
 sin. There's nothing I could do that could earn a

478
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,280
 relationship with you. It's only by what you did

479
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,840
 in my place on that cross, bleeding out for me,

480
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
 dying for everything wrong I've ever done or will

481
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,280
 do that I can have eternal life. And you rose from

482
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,160
 the dead to prove that payment was enough. And I

483
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,520
 believe that, that you step into a relationship

484
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,200
 with God that starts from a genuine faith or trust

485
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,640
 in Jesus. And could it be that you've grown up and

486
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
 you know a lot about him? Man, let's be honest, you

487
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,200
 live in America. You're going to know a lot about

488
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,720
 Jesus or a lot more than you're going to know

489
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,120
 about Buddha. But you don't actually have a

490
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,200
 relationship with him. You don't actually know

491
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,440
 him. When we were in California this past week on

492
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,040
 that beach vacation, I had to take an Uber to go

493
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
 meet some friends basically for lunch in another

494
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,680
 area. And I got an Uber and I was driving and

495
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,360
 talking with the lady and she's just one of those

496
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,560
 Uber drivers that's like super chatty. And you're

497
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,280
 like, man, you clearly have, you know, just a lot

498
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,920
 on your mind. And yeah, let's talk, lady. And so

499
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,400
 we talked about a lot of different things and

500
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,360
 faith being one of them and other things. But at

501
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,320
 one point we were driving through Malibu and she

502
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,440
 begins to point out and reference all the

503
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,720
 different celebrities that lived in Malibu. And

504
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,360
 she's going like, oh, yeah, you know, there's J

505
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,560
 Lo, her and Ben. They live right up in that

506
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
 mountain. Bradley Cooper always rides his

507
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,480
 motorcycle over here. And he'll be in this area.

508
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
 And just Malibu had, you know, Mel Gibson. He

509
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,880
 loves that bar over there that people are hanging

510
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,280
 out at. And Lady Gaga is in this gated community

511
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,560
 up here. At one point she's like, and this house

512
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,880
 we're about to pass used to be shares, but she

513
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,400
 sold it to, oh man, it's the guy who married one

514
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,280
 of the Kardashians. And she had like just hot

515
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,320
 takes. She was like, I just I'm not a fan of his.

516
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,680
 I can't remember his name. And I was like, man, I

517
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,120
 wonder who she's talking about. And eventually

518
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,280
 she's like, he's like a musician. I was like,

519
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,800
 Kanye? She was like, Kanye. Yeah, Kanye lives

520
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,040
 right over there. Real piece of work. It's such

521
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,520
 hot takes. It was like, man, who hurt you? And

522
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,200
 all that to say, it was such a funny experience

523
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,240
 because you're driving by and you're like, oh,

524
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,880
 it's so interesting, you know, hearing of all

525
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,760
 these people maybe you've seen on movies or you

526
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,280
 listen to their music and you have some

527
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,040
 familiarity with and you know about. But if I

528
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,040
 showed up at Kanye's house or I knock on the door

529
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,200
 of, you know, JLo and Ben and I'm like, hey, guys,

530
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,800
 I'm here. Ben, just got to say, big fan. Goodwill

531
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,920
 hunting. I thought it was a classic. OK, you guys

532
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,640
 want to hang? They would say, what are you doing

533
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,520
 on my property? If I went over to Kanye's and I

534
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,680
 said, hey, man, you know, high school dropout. I

535
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,760
 feel like that was the zenith, honestly, of

536
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,200
 everything in their career. And I just want to

537
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,320
 hang and dialogue. He would go, who are you?

538
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,480
 Because I don't know them. I know about them.

539
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:17,640
 And a lot of people. Live their whole life. And

540
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,680
 because of the environment they're in, they know

541
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,560
 about Jesus. But they don't know him. They don't

542
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,840
 have a relationship with him. They have a fake

543
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,800
 faith. Which is not a true or saving faith. And

544
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,400
 finally. After a flawed fake, we see a freeing

545
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,960
 faith that just God just goes to work in Ephesus

546
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,520
 and says this. Verse 17. When this became known

547
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,400
 to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, that

548
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,360
 God was just at work in mighty ways, they were

549
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,640
 all seized with fear. And the name of the Lord

550
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:03,520
 Jesus was held in high honor. Many. Of those who

551
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:11,840
 believed. Who had faith in Jesus. Now came. And

552
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,120
 openly confessed. What they had done. They have

553
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,200
 this faith that begins to take place and root in

554
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,040
 their life and it leads them to an action and

555
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,800
 that action is confession. And a number. Who had

556
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,960
 practiced sorcery or your translation may say

557
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,320
 dark magic. Brought their scrolls together and

558
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,720
 they burned them publicly. And when they had

559
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,960
 calculated the value of the scrolls, the total

560
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
 came to 50,000 drachmas or the equivalent of

561
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,840
 around 10 million dollars today. In this way, the

562
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,400
 word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.

563
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
 Here's what they just said. Men and women, they

564
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,600
 began to come to faith in Jesus. And it began to

565
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,320
 do something in their life and it led to an

566
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
 action. The action wasn't they became perfection.

567
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,960
 It led to confession. And you have men and women.

568
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,360
 I mean, think about what the text just said. They

569
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,200
 began to bring forward. I have been involved in

570
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,360
 some dark things. I have practiced dark magic. I

571
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,040
 have been a part of things that I am ashamed of.

572
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,680
 And it says they began to confess what they had

573
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,760
 done openly. With other believers and they began

574
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,200
 to repent and say, I am leaving this behind. I'm

575
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,040
 leaving and piling together. Think about the

576
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,200
 equivalent of anything that we would put together

577
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,880
 and go, hey, this is going to be worth 10 million

578
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,840
 dollars. Which shows the widespread practice of

579
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,960
 dark magic. It was taking place then. Today in our

580
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,840
 day, it would be the equivalent of prostitution.

581
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
 I've been involved in things I am not proud of.

582
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,720
 I have been involved in things that have hurt

583
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,520
 people deeply. And they began to bring it forward

584
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,720
 and say, I am bringing this out now that I'm in

585
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,920
 Christ. My faith is leading to action. And an

586
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,280
 expression and that expression is confession, that

587
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,920
 I am going to bring this out and openly share with

588
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,200
 other people. And when they did, they experienced

589
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,160
 a freedom. That's the final thing I just want to

590
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,240
 talk about. One aspect of true faith is that it's

591
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
 a freeing faith. And the reason it's a freeing

592
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,120
 faith is because it leads believers, very

593
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,760
 important. To confess. Not for the sake of having

594
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,400
 shame piled on them, but for the sake of

595
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,280
 experiencing healing. The Bible says that when you

596
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,040
 and I begin to open up and say, these are the

597
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,240
 things that I struggle with today, I've been a

598
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,520
 part of in life and I want to experience healing

599
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,120
 from them. The step we take is bringing it out in

600
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,440
 the open to other believers in our life, which is

601
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,280
 why we hit on community so much, because if you

602
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,680
 want to experience God's healing in your life and

603
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,760
 operate from not a place of woundedness, you've

604
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,120
 got to open up with other people in your life. My

605
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,640
 son, from time to time, will play outside, he'll

606
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,000
 get different splinters in his hands, and he's so

607
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
 terrified that I'll have to come in and take

608
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
 tweezers and I have to get it out. And he's like,

609
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,040
 no, I'm fine. I'll just live with it forever. It'll

610
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,920
 be great. And I as his dad know, if I don't get

611
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,880
 that out, it's going to stay painful and infected.

612
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,240
 The only way it can heal is you've got to get it

613
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,440
 out. And the same is true in Christian faith,

614
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,760
 whether that's a current struggle with

615
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,040
 pornography. Maybe it's the same sex relationship

616
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,360
 no one knows about. Maybe it's something you did

617
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,320
 in high school you never told anybody about.

618
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,680
 Maybe it's just a thought battle that just plagues

619
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,760
 you around body image, anxiety. What do you do

620
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,920
 with that? The Bible says that we bring that

621
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,320
 through confession to other believers. In your

622
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,160
 life. And we share. And this is really important

623
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
 because here's what you need to know. Maybe

624
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,640
 you're new to Christianity, maybe just you've

625
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,480
 gotten back in your faith and it's you're trying

626
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,960
 to follow Jesus. And sometimes, sadly, inside of

627
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,000
 the church environment, we communicate things

628
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,480
 unintentionally like this. Here's Bob. Bob last

629
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,240
 week was strung out on heroin. He was down, you

630
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,080
 know, doing everything wrong inside of life in

631
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,240
 the world. And then he trusted Jesus. And now

632
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,880
 Bob is wearing a suit. He's pinned up and he's

633
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,920
 never struggled since. And that happens. It's

634
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,400
 just not the case most of the time. And the

635
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,160
 danger of a message like that is like, oh, man,

636
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,800
 if I come to Jesus, then everything overnight

637
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,360
 is always going to be fixed and I won't struggle

638
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,080
 like this anymore, which is just not the truth.

639
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,040
 And it tells somebody who is in the room who's

640
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,880
 going, man, I've come to Jesus and I became a

641
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,240
 believer. And I thought the message was I'm not

642
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,760
 going to struggle with these things anymore. All

643
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,720
 the abuse from my past, that's not going to own

644
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,680
 me anymore. Like I'm going to be free. And the

645
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:50,160
 truth is. One day you will. In eternity. But in

646
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,200
 this life. When those thoughts and those moments

647
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,160
 happen, because just as a believer, Kimberly,

648
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,520
 every broken person inside of this room, myself

649
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,840
 very much included, still has things and areas

650
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,520
 that I look at my life and I'm like, God, when

651
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,880
 are you going to take ground in this? How many

652
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,040
 more years and how much more age, how much more

653
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,960
 life am I to have to do where I still struggle

654
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
 with this? I'm at the beach last week and I'm

655
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
 with my kids and I'm with my wife. And you know

656
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,680
 what still goes through my mind? Man, there's a

657
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,000
 girl who walks by in a bikini and I want to

658
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,880
 look and I know I shouldn't, but I still want to.

659
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,080
 And I hope that somebody else walks by. And what

660
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,680
 do I do with those moments? What do you do when

661
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,000
 you love Jesus and you still find yourself

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,160
 struggling with things that plague you? Ready?

663
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,760
 You confess it and you bring it out into the

664
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,840
 light. And you begin to experience healing.

665
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,640
 There's no perfect formula that if you do this

666
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,880
 and X, Y, Z, there is a promise from God, Hey, I

667
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,840
 began this good work and I will finish it. And

668
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,080
 there may be a differing degrees to which that

669
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,560
 takes its place out inside of your life that it

670
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,160
 does another person that you may struggle for a

671
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,200
 long amount of time or temptation maybe looks

672
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
 different inside of your life. So what do you do

673
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,560
 in those moments? Ready? You confess it to

674
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,600
 experience healing. And when that happens, you

675
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,480
 experience and step towards freedom. And you do

676
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,640
 this at a thought level of here's the just lies

677
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,360
 that I'm believing so much of the anxiety in the

678
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,800
 room is connected to the fact that you won't open

679
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,920
 up with anyone. And you feel like, man, I'm all

680
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,560
 alone. No one else struggles with this. And you

681
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,160
 bought a lie and an enemy that wants you to stay

682
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,440
 there. And you're the only one who struggles. And

683
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,680
 if you told them, you know what they would think

684
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,080
 about you. And it's just a lie. And the church

685
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,360
 in Ephesus did the astonishing move of saying,

686
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,440
 this is what I have been a part of. I have been a

687
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,800
 part of dark things I am ashamed of, and I am

688
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,000
 bringing it into the light and I am burning the

689
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,360
 bridges. They burned the scrolls accounting to

690
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,960
 50,000 drachmas or $10 million. They weren't

691
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,160
 like, hey, let's sell this. We'll give it to the

692
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,440
 church. I am burning every opportunity and I'm

693
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,840
 walking away, which is called repenting. That

694
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
 looks like I'm pouring the alcohol out. I'm

695
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,920
 deleting their phone number. I am getting not a

696
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
 smartphone anymore. I'm putting covenant eyes on

697
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,920
 my phone. I am making steps because this is not

698
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,760
 something I want to be part of my story. And the

699
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,040
 good news in Christ is you can confess freely and

700
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
 open up freely because here's what the truth is.

701
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,360
 That doesn't define you. Jesus does. That's why

702
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,840
 we have the freedom and the opportunity and

703
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,120
 ability to confess, because, hey, despite the

704
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,960
 fact that I've done this and I want to do this

705
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,000
 and I'm doing this, it doesn't define me because

706
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,080
 Christ defines me. And any amount of shame and

707
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,560
 guilt that is not from the Lord conviction comes

708
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,080
 from the spirit. But that's going to leave me

709
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,520
 that I can share this and I am broken. And that's

710
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,360
 why I need a savior. Romans chapter eight says

711
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,440
 that Jesus, he's speaker Paul is talking and he

712
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,320
 says, man, do you know if you were in Christ,

713
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,160
 there is no accusation, no thing that anybody can

714
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,320
 bring against you. It has been finished and

715
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,000
 nothing will define you if you are in Jesus,

716
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,160
 because he does. It says this Romans chapter

717
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,240
 eight, verse thirty one. I'm about to be done.

718
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,880
 What shall I say in response to these things?

719
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,560
 If God is for us, who can be against us? He

720
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
 didn't spare his own son. He gave him up for us

721
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,040
 all. How will he not also graciously give us all

722
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,120
 thing who will bring any charge against God's

723
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,560
 elect? It is God who justifies who then is the

724
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,520
 one who condemns. No one for those who are in

725
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,520
 Christ. Jesus, who died Christ, Jesus, who died

726
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,160
 more than that, who was raised to life is at the

727
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,240
 right hand of God interceding for us, so we

728
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,280
 bring it knowing this doesn't define me. And my

729
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,800
 faith leads to the expression of confession. And

730
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,320
 when that happens, I experience healing. It's why

731
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,520
 Paul would write the very first words of the Book

732
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,120
 of Ephesians and say, Paul, an apostle writing to

733
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:52,880
 you. Saints, you're not sorcerers. You're not sex

734
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,200
 addicts. You are not perfect. You are saints in

735
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,000
 Christ. And they came and they shared and they

736
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,760
 experienced healing. And one of the ways, you

737
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960
 know, man, I have a real faith, a freeing faith

738
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,880
 is I open up and I can share. That doesn't define

739
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,400
 me. And the thing you're afraid of right now, the

740
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,160
 guilt and shame that you carry and you think

741
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,000
 you're going to carry it till you're dead. It's

742
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,600
 tragic because you think if others knew. Man,

743
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,720
 that's how they're going to see you. And the

744
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,000
 truth is, no matter how anyone sees you, that

745
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,360
 doesn't define you. Because in Christ. He defines

746
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,480
 you. It's interesting, we know, like I said, more

747
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,400
 about the church in Ephesus than any other church.

748
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,960
 We know the beginning, we know the middle. And we

749
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,160
 know something that happened at the end. Thirty

750
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,480
 years after the apostle Paul would write to the

751
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,560
 Ephesian church. The apostle John would once

752
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,880
 again, under the instruction of Jesus, write a

753
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,680
 letter to the church in Ephesus, Revelation,

754
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,720
 chapter two, the last book of the Bible. The

755
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,600
 apostle John is instructed by Jesus, hey,

756
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,160
 there's seven churches, I want you to write to

757
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,600
 these seven churches. The first one, the church

758
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,000
 of Ephesus. And here's what Jesus says to write.

759
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,280
 To the angel, the church in Ephesus, right?

760
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,920
 I know your deeds, your hard work and your

761
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,920
 perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate

762
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
 wicked people, you have tested those who claim

763
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,360
 to be apostles but are not, and you have found

764
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,040
 them false. He just said, hey, I know how hard

765
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,160
 you work. I know how faithful you are. I know

766
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,200
 that you, when it comes to truth, you don't fall

767
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,040
 for what other people may fall for. You are sound

768
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,080
 biblically. You know the Bible and you stand on

769
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,200
 it. You have persevered and endured hardship or

770
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,840
 persecution for my name and have not grown weary.

771
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,120
 Now we stop there. That's a real positive

772
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,960
 encouragement. Mate, you guys are biblically

773
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,640
 sound. You know the word. You know it to the

774
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,080
 point when someone says something that's not

775
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,400
 accurate, you, and not just that, everybody's

776
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,320
 getting persecuted, people are falling away and

777
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,640
 you're going, I'm going to stand firm. And then

778
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,120
 it takes a shift. Yet I hold this against you.

779
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,120
 You have forsaken the love that you had at first.

780
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,120
 Consider how far you have fallen. Repent and do

781
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:01,360
 the things you did at first. If you do not

782
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,920
 repent, I will come and I will remove your

783
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,080
 lampstand from its place. Translation, if you

784
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,440
 don't do the things that you did at first, you're

785
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,160
 no longer going to be the people of God because

786
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,240
 you're not going to be the church. What is he

787
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,280
 saying? The only record of the things they did

788
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
 at first that's contained in the Bible is what

789
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,040
 we just read in Acts chapter 18. They came

790
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,680
 together and they opened up and they shared

791
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,200
 honestly and they confessed. And Jesus just

792
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,160
 said, hey man, you guys, you're this church and

793
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,920
 you know the Bible and you, when everyone else

794
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,640
 may turn away because it costs them, man, you

795
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,160
 stand firm. But you're not doing and living

796
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,960
 openly and honestly like you used to. You've

797
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
 drifted from your first love that said, I don't

798
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,400
 care what anyone thinks, I'm going to open up

799
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,760
 and be honest because I want to experience

800
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,800
 freedom and I want to honor God. You guys have

801
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,760
 begun to play the game and you show up Church

802
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,560
 of Ephesus and you look pretty and you know the

803
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,960
 Bible and you know things that are right and

804
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,520
 you're going to stand firm and you know,

805
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,440
 culture's going to hell in a handbasket, but not

806
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,480
 us. And it's pretend. You're not being open,

807
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,080
 you're not being honest. You're just playing

808
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,880
 church. And he says, when that happens, you're

809
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,920
 not the church because the church is meant to

810
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,720
 be a place where broken people can gather and

811
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,680
 come together and say, it's okay to not be okay.

812
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,400
 And I need you to come encourage me and say,

813
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,920
 but we're not going to stay that way. And we're

814
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,840
 going to lovingly walk alongside of each other.

815
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,960
 Whatever you're walking through, whatever

816
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,600
 brokenness that you're afraid of, the best

817
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,280
 encouragement I would give you tonight, you can

818
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,960
 experience a step towards freedom. Am I saying

819
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,680
 you won't be tempted tomorrow? No, I'm saying

820
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,640
 you can step towards freedom. Or you can keep

821
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,120
 playing the game and fall into the same trap

822
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,640
 that who knows how it happened in Ephesus. Again,

823
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,320
 keep going. I know the Bible and community just

824
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,000
 not open. I'm not honest, but that doesn't have

825
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,240
 to be your story. And for the rest of your life,

826
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,000
 you and I have the decision. Am I going to live

827
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,360
 honestly and openly and experience a faith that

828
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:15,600
 brings freedom? Let me pray. Father, you know,

829
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:22,880
 the thousands of stories, the thousands of hurts,

830
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,400
 disappointments, heartaches, frustrations, things

831
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,120
 that have happened in our lives that have led us

832
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,840
 to make decisions where we've acted in ways that

833
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,280
 we have regret over or we are currently still

834
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,880
 living inside of. And you know the shame and the

835
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:51,200
 fear. And I pray that you would win tonight. For

836
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,320
 anyone who knows, man, I just need to, oh, I need

837
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,800
 to text someone in my community. I don't have a

838
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,440
 community. I just need somebody that can help me.

839
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,520
 That your spirit would flood the hearts of your

840
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,400
 people right now and lead to an outbreak of

841
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,000
 confession, an outbreak of the expression of our

842
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,640
 faith that that is. And we'd experience healing.

843
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,520
 Father, I pray for anyone who has arrived at the

844
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,000
 reality of man, my faith is not real. It's fake.

845
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,400
 They wouldn't feel condemnation. They would feel

846
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,360
 the loving whisper of their heavenly father saying

847
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,640
 I died for you. My son was crucified for you.

848
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:42,440
 And they would cross over. And. Be introduced

849
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:50,360
 through Jesus to the new. Them. The new life.

850
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,760
 Father, thank you for the story of Ephesus. Would

851
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,360
 you protect us from playing the game and

852
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,160
 pretending? And would we be your people? We worship

853
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,960
 you now in song. Amen.
