[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.440]   - What's up everybody in the room,
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.640]   everybody joining us online.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.240]   All of our PortsLive locations,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.420]   specifically PortsLive Midland, Tulsa,
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.440]   North Houston, Austin, Texas,
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.800]   wherever you are joining,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.120]   we are continuing with this series
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.060]   on a look at the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.860]   This past weekend, I had a life changing experience
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.200]   and that my family officially became minivan people.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.440]   Now, I don't want you to think of me any differently,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.720]   I'm still the same person.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.120]   And my wife, just for months and months,
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.740]   has, I don't think I've ever seen or want something more,
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.240]   and so finally we were able to find and got a minivan.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.280]   And so we went and ended up going home
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.440]   and everything was great.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.840]   But while we were there, I was asked,
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.720]   hey, do you want to trade in a vehicle?
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480]   Now, let me give my hot take,
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.280]   everybody's got certain hot takes.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.400]   It's my opinion that you should never trade in your vehicle
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.240]   to a dealership.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960]   Now here's why, 'cause they always low ball you.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560]   You always end up getting a car that you have
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.080]   that's worth $8,000, they're gonna be like, here's 140.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.860]   And you end up not maximizing the potential.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.100]   So I always sell it private parties,
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.300]   just one of those things in life that I do.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.540]   So I'll take that car and try to sell it on Craigslist,
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.700]   try to sell it on some third party app
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.740]   and try to maximize potential profits.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.460]   So that was happening and that's currently going on.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.340]   But for that to happen, you've got to clean and detail
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.860]   my wife's old car.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.100]   So I'm cleaning and detailing and having her old car
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.620]   all cleaned up and I realized that the front headlights
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620]   of her vehicle had experienced something that happens
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.860]   really over time with most vehicles.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.620]   Your headlights begin, they start out clear
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.600]   and you can see them and it's like a clear glass
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.200]   on the front two headlights of your car.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.820]   And eventually over time with wear and tear,
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.300]   they oxidate and they begin to be like cloudy
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.780]   and it just didn't look good.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.900]   So I went and I purchased Headlight Restoration
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.100]   to the rescue, which you apply on there
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.220]   and it goes from looking ugly to being restored
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.060]   to looking like it's back to the original way it was made.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.460]   And what does that have to do with tonight?
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.820]   Nothing, I just needed to talk to you about minivans
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.660]   for a little bit.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.300]   No, the point of that story is in the same way
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.040]   that you take something and you are restoring it back
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.220]   to its original created design.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.020]   The Apostle Paul has been arguing through the book
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.460]   of Ephesians that God in Christ, when you trust in Jesus,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.580]   he is making a new you.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.220]   That's why the subtitle of this series
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.800]   is Introducing the New You.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.540]   And the reality is that just like over time
[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.940]   and through wear and tear and events,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.420]   something that was originally created in a certain way
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.420]   gets increasingly less like it was created originally.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.300]   When sin entered the world, every human heart
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   and every human soul had a fracture, if you will.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.940]   And the gospel is God restoring back
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.020]   the original design of humanity
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.860]   for you to be an image bearer of God.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.060]   As you and I follow Jesus, he is restoring
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.580]   and he's establishing the new us,
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.060]   the new creation that we are.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.340]   And as you continue to follow him,
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.140]   that's the process he's been laying out
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.980]   and that he's gonna do.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.660]   And the Apostle Paul has been tracing,
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.340]   hey, you have a new life in Christ.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.340]   God is restoring the reflection of God in humanity
[00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.780]   as you follow Jesus.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.440]   And tonight he's gonna lay out specifically
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.420]   this new life that you have and how you experience change.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.540]   In other words, if you are not experiencing change
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.020]   as a follower of Jesus or you say you love Jesus,
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.340]   but your life is not shifting
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.660]   and becoming more and more like Jesus,
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.820]   it's because of not doing the things
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.500]   he's gonna talk about tonight.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.080]   So we're gonna be in Ephesians chapter four
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.740]   as we're gonna look at what the new life
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.020]   that you and I have in Jesus includes
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.860]   and how God brings about change inside of your life.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.740]   If you've ever wanted to experience more of your purpose,
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.300]   more peace, less destructive habits,
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.060]   tendencies, relationships,
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.220]   the Apostle Paul's words are for you.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.300]   And so we're gonna start in verse 17
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.580]   and we're gonna trace through three things
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.600]   that he says about the new you, introducing the new you.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.140]   Now, the book of Ephesians was written
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.220]   by the Apostle formerly known as Saul
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.460]   who changed or had his name changed to Paul.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.900]   He spent the first half of his life
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.860]   trying to stomp out Christianity
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.520]   and then he encountered Jesus and everything changed.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.940]   And he would spend the rest of his life
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.820]   telling people about Jesus and telling Christians
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.100]   how to live the new life that they have in Christ.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.460]   And one of the groups that he would talk to
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   was the church in Ephesus.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.580]   If you join us for the first week,
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.060]   we've been walking through this book,
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.740]   written about 60 AD to a church meeting
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.000]   in the city of Ephesus.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.460]   It's a beautiful city.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.940]   Climate is like LA.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.260]   It's on the water.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.300]   People wanted to live there and it still exists today.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.280]   You could get on a plane and go visit it.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.120]   And there was a group of Christians
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.300]   trying to live out their faith
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.680]   and that's what Paul has been writing.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.300]   Here's what it looks like to live in light of the new you.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.460]   Starts in verse 17.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.080]   So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.100]   You must no longer live as the Gentiles do.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.500]   Now Gentiles is not really a term that we use very often.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.100]   My guess is no one used that phrase
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.420]   at your work or your office today.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.740]   But it's basically Paul's description of the world.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.500]   Hey, you are not to live like the rest of the world.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.780]   In the futility of their thinking,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.340]   they are darkened in their understanding
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.920]   and separated from the life of God
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.580]   because of the ignorance that is in them
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.760]   due to the hardening of their hearts.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.380]   Having lost all sensitivity,
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.020]   they have given themselves over to sensuality
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.060]   so as to indulge in every kind of impurity
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.140]   and they are full of greed.
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.340]   So the Apostle Paul goes very dark, very fast.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.700]   Zero to 60, he's basically going,
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.300]   you're not to live like the rest of the world.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.020]   And then he begins to describe
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.380]   how the rest of the world operates.
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.560]   But the first point I wanna talk about is him saying,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.360]   hey, if you were in Jesus,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.980]   you were to stand out because of the new creation.
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.300]   When you trusted in Christ and you said,
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.500]   God, I accept you as my Lord, my Savior,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.260]   the payment for everything wrong I've ever done,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.900]   everything wrong I ever will do.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.580]   I'll never be able to earn a relationship with you
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.700]   and I don't have to
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.900]   because that's why Jesus was sent into the world.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.780]   The moment you trust in Jesus's death and resurrection,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.540]   it's like a new life has been created.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.380]   And Paul is saying, you are called to live
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.420]   in light of the new life that God has given you
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.000]   and not look like the world.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.120]   You have a new identity.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.900]   The first thing I wanna talk about is this new identity
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.660]   leads to new activity.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.060]   He's saying you're to stand out.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.380]   You're not to be like everybody else
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.160]   'cause you're not like everybody else.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.140]   You have a new identity that leads to a new activity.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.460]   About six months ago, my son came home on a Monday
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.620]   from school and he was stoked.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.460]   He was elated.
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.900]   And my wife, I came into the door and she was like,
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.420]   crew, you gotta tell your dad what today was
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.260]   and why it was such an exciting day.
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.320]   And he began to tell me that this was his week
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.920]   to be the line leader.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   Now, crew is six and this only happens one time a year
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.320]   where he goes no longer is he crew Marvin alone.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.400]   He is crew Marvin, the line leader.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.740]   What is the line leader?
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.800]   They lead the line.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.600]   And so as they walk all throughout school
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.920]   and do different activities,
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.360]   they are the person at the front of the line.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.860]   He is a new identity that led to a new activity.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.200]   He is the line leader, which means he will lead.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.220]   And the same is true in a much more profound and real sense.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.820]   Paul is saying, hey, you have a new identity in Christ
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.980]   that leads to new activity in your life.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.420]   You are to look different
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.420]   from the rest of the world around you.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.980]   It makes sense why they would live that way,
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.140]   but you are to live different.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.620]   He's gonna unpack in a few minutes
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.260]   exactly what that looks like.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.920]   But he describes the mindset
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.240]   and the person who doesn't know Jesus.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.980]   And he uses some pretty colorful language.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.820]   I'm gonna walk back through.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.880]   He says in the futility of their thinking.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.220]   What does that mean?
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.740]   Again, futility is probably not something
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.220]   that you had a lot of conversations about today
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.900]   or anyone's ever come up to you and said,
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.260]   like, you know what your problem is?
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.540]   Futility of thinking.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.660]   Futility is a word that means purposelessness.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.280]   What is he saying?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.220]   He's saying you are not to live
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.740]   with your mind just focused on this life
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.260]   and this length of time you have
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.140]   and just on the job and just on getting the raise
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.140]   and just on the vapor that is this life.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.700]   You are to live with the perspective
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.060]   that is informed by eternity.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.140]   That you are not like them.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.660]   They live and they think like that
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.940]   because this life is all that they know.
[00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.540]   But you, you do know Jesus.
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.740]   You do know God.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.260]   And you are to live in light of that.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.060]   They are darkened in their understanding.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.360]   In other words, they don't understand
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.980]   that they have a need for a savior.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.200]   They may think that, hey, being a good person
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.600]   or if I just don't do crazy bad things,
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.000]   then I can have eternal life and live with Jesus
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.940]   and live with God or go to heaven.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.760]   And Paul would say it's because they're darkened
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.420]   in their understanding.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.180]   They have been cut off from the life of God.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.680]   They don't have access to the life of God.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.280]   But you do, so you should look different.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   It's language, like they're cut off from a source.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.160]   So of course, they're not gonna have the life
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.540]   and look like Jesus, but you do.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.840]   Every once in a while,
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.500]   this feels like a pretty common experience.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.920]   I'll plug my phone in at night
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.760]   and it's plugged in to the charger
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   and the next morning I wake up
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.380]   and it's almost out of batteries or out of batteries.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.080]   And I'll look at the end of the charger
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   and it's because it had gotten disconnected from the wall.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.240]   So of course, there's nothing, no source that is fueling it.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.000]   And Paul's saying, man, it makes sense.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.280]   Nonbelievers living, dating, acting, spending,
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.920]   living their life like somebody who doesn't know Jesus
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.760]   makes sense.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.420]   They're just fulfilling their job description.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.520]   They don't know Jesus, but you do.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.880]   That you have a new identity
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.200]   that should lead to a new activity.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.800]   He says they are desensitized to things that are destructive.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.920]   They've lost all sensitivity is what he says.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.200]   That they have appetites for sex, pleasure,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.120]   just living for the now
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.000]   that is leading to destruction in their own life
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.080]   and they're unaware.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.760]   I was reading an article this week on Chris Rock,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.720]   who, the comedian,
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.860]   and he was talking about his addiction to pornography
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.020]   and how it destroyed his marriage.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.640]   And I don't know Chris and his faith
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.480]   and where he's at on that,
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.040]   but what he said was really telling.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.860]   He said, I was married for 18 years
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.060]   and pornography began to feed an appetite
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.980]   that just began to grow and grow.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.140]   And I thought it was fine
[00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.300]   and it's just something that's a part of life.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.180]   And he got to the place where he honestly admits,
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.460]   I was unable to be intimate with my wife without pornography
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.460]   because I just fed and fed and fed this.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.440]   And he's kind of reflecting exactly what Paul's saying.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.340]   They are desensitized to all sensuality.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.780]   And as believers,
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.060]   you and I are called to look different from the world,
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.120]   to follow Jesus in a way that leads to life
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.180]   and is consistent with the new life
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.220]   that you have in Christ,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.840]   that the world around us is chasing only this temporary life
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.860]   and you and I are to look different.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.900]   So here's my question.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.340]   How does your life look different
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.020]   from your unbelieving friends?
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.520]   How does your life look different?
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.820]   'Cause I mean, some of us,
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.140]   we would say we're a Christian,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.620]   but there's non-Christians
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.460]   that if you would compare your life and theirs,
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.260]   they look more like they're following Christ than you do
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.560]   in terms of how they date, talk, think, care for people.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.340]   Like, does your life look different than the world?
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.620]   As Christians, we're called to date different,
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.540]   we're called to talk different,
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.520]   called to watch different entertainment
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.020]   than the world around us does.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:50.420]   That we have a new identity that leads to a new activity.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.260]   He talks about, man, they indulge in sexuality
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.220]   and they just don't care.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.260]   I mean, this would include how we date involves purity,
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.040]   that we believe as followers of Jesus,
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.540]   God designed sex to take place in marriage.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.700]   Would someone looking at your dating relationship say,
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.900]   man, they are different than how everybody else does it
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.620]   because they follow Jesus?
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.140]   What's sad about those who make that decision,
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.060]   or sleeping together,
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.980]   is you're communicating to the person you're dating,
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.700]   I am willing to sleep with someone
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.720]   outside of the context of marriage.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.260]   When it comes to being married someday,
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.500]   what gives you the confidence that you will continue
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.620]   to maintain that commitment with just them?
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.440]   You've already shown,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.580]   I'll sleep with somebody outside of marriage.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.560]   Having done a lot of marriages and weddings over the years,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.020]   the couples who have the strongest I do's
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.540]   are the ones who say I don't in their dating relationship.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.300]   The couples who have the strongest I do's
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.060]   and bond together are the ones who, when they date,
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.800]   they say, man, I'm honoring what God says
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.860]   and I'm honoring her and I'm honoring him
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.780]   and pursuing purity together.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.820]   And the ones that have the weakest I do's
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.800]   are the ones who don't say I don't
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.220]   'cause they just continue to live
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.100]   and do what they will do in marriage,
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.980]   whatever feels or seems right to them.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.800]   Do you look different from the world?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.400]   'Cause Paul's saying you are different.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.220]   And I'm not saying that there won't be times
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.660]   where just because of your story and trauma
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.600]   or maybe abuse or maybe like you or like me,
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.920]   you had pornography for years in my story
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.180]   where there's not times where you still get tempted
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.640]   or whatever the different brokenness represented here,
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.080]   but the spirit of God wants to continue
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:48.080]   to restore and grow and bring about that new life.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.020]   My aunt Vicki has a dog,
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.340]   I'm not even sure what kind of dog it is.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.540]   It's like an eight pound white,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.320]   it's like the antithesis of everything
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.160]   that a dog should be.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.480]   But this dog, when you go over there,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.200]   it's not just that, it's sadly,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.520]   anytime you touch its tail, it just goes berserk
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.920]   and starts biting and yapping
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.660]   because it came from an abused environment,
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.720]   had an abusive owner,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.560]   and then it got given to the pound
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.800]   and eventually adopted by my aunt.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.700]   And so there's still gonna be things
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.860]   that you may bring with you from the past,
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.440]   traumatic events, things that you've experienced
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.240]   that don't overnight always go away.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.000]   But God's desire and as you and I follow Jesus
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.840]   is that he would bring more and more healing
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.280]   to those things 'cause you have a new identity
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.880]   that he's bringing about new activity.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.760]   And then he lays out a further way
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.280]   that this happens, verse 20.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:51.220]   That, however, is not the way you learn Jesus.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.920]   When you heard about Christ
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.480]   and you were taught in accordance,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   or in him, in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.780]   that you were taught the truth about Jesus,
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.920]   you were taught, verse 22,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.960]   with regard to your former way of life
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.080]   to put off your old self,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   which is being corrupted by deceitful desires,
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.760]   and to be made new in the attitude of your minds,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   and to put on the new self,
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.540]   That Paul said, hey, no, but you,
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.680]   you're not like the world.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   You learned Christ and you were taught
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.120]   to put off the old self and put on the new
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.520]   by renewing your mind, by changing your thinking,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.640]   that he brings up the mind,
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.520]   which is one of the key ways
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.000]   that God brings transformation about in our life,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.760]   that it doesn't happen through just bootstraps
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.080]   and more effort and some motivational speech up here,
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.040]   but you begin to change your thinking
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.480]   and it changes your living.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   The second point from the text
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.660]   is that new living comes from new thinking.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:58.480]   That you and I go through the process of being made new
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.300]   by having our minds transformed by the truth.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.400]   Romans chapter 12, verse two says,
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.120]   do not conform to the pattern of the world.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.160]   Be transformed, how?
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.000]   By the renewing of your mind,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.600]   that you begin to put off the old and put on the new,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.800]   that you don't just try harder one day,
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.200]   you address the lies,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.240]   'cause he brings up deceitful desires,
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.340]   these lies that fuel self-destructive behaviors,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.360]   addictions, sins, toxic relationships.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.600]   So you address the lies
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.360]   and you embrace the truth of God's word,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.160]   and this is the path by which he brings about transformation
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.680]   that renewing and new living comes from new thinking
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.400]   or renewed thinking,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.560]   thinking that doesn't go with what people have told you
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.280]   or what your advice from some mentor,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.040]   if it's not consistent with God's word,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.520]   that I begin to embrace what God says about life,
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.380]   dating, love, marriage, work,
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:01.660]   and I hold onto those truths and I put off the lies.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.960]   It's really a two-step process
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.640]   that's consistent with probably something
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.120]   a lot of people in this room do every week or often.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.800]   You guys know what this is?
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.720]   This is nail polish.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.560]   And having been married for the last 10 years,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.240]   I have seen this process happen over and over and over,
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.740]   and it is renewing of someone's nails,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.040]   and it involves two things.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.160]   Men, let me just break this down for you.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.600]   It doesn't just, if they're going through their day
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.000]   and they got their nails painted
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.960]   and all of a sudden something chips off
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.560]   or they wanna change color,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.000]   they don't just, if it's already been painted on there
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.680]   and they wanna go from red to whatever,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   they first must take off the old nail polish
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.440]   in order to prepare, and they use something
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.480]   that somehow burns away paint,
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.880]   like NASA invented it or something,
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.800]   and they take off the old and then they apply the new.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.080]   And as funny as that is,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.040]   that's really the process the Bible says
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.920]   by which we change,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.520]   that you and I have to get to the root of the lies
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.840]   that are fueling some of the struggles
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.320]   and behaviors that are there.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.240]   Let me just press in a little and give you some examples.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.960]   If you struggle with an eating disorder,
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.120]   it's fueled by a lie.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.980]   And it could be a lie that,
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.960]   man, my value is found in the way that I look.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.800]   And you may not even articulate it that way.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.920]   You would say, no, it's just the only thing I can control
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.720]   and it's not that big of a deal,
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   but deep down, you've brought a lie
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:46.240]   that your value has anything to do with your appearance.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.760]   And that lie needs to be replaced
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.360]   with the truth from God's word
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.680]   that you are a woman or man made in the image of God.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.240]   You are of such eternal value,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.920]   God would give his own life for you.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.040]   No way that you look or ever will look or ever have look
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.280]   has anything to do with your value.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.960]   And Paul's saying, man, you change your living
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.400]   by changing your thinking.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.480]   Maybe, you know, we talked about sex and marriage.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.920]   Oftentimes, that can be fueled,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.820]   or sex outside of marriage, I'm sorry,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.860]   by a subtle lie that you believe
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.980]   that's connected to your value.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.860]   You may think of it like, man, if I don't,
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.180]   everybody else, everybody sleeps,
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.540]   it's just not that big of a deal.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.780]   And if I don't, he may not stay.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.620]   You have bought a lie
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.620]   that you are not a valuable enough person
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.900]   for someone to want you just for you, not your body.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.700]   And God says, man, your value is of such extraordinary worth
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.860]   that I would give my life for you.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.940]   And there's no man that can change that
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.380]   or has anything to do with that.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.540]   I don't know what it is, but I know that
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.180]   the devil is called the father of lies,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.180]   and he speaks deception over, it's not that big of a deal,
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.260]   it's just one time, no one will know,
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.740]   it's not hurting anybody.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.820]   And the scripture said, that's not true at all.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.420]   Sin always hurts.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.620]   Hurts you, it hurts me.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.580]   And you and I combat that and live the new life
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.700]   by taking off the old and embracing the truth.
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.860]   This is why we talk so much about scripture
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.060]   and saturating our mind with what is true,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.860]   because every day, you and I are bombarded
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.740]   with all kinds of lies.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.980]   Some of you, you find your worth in your paycheck
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.260]   and what you've accomplished.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.940]   And you, when you go there,
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.060]   are gonna experience all kinds of anxiety and stress
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.660]   because something is potentially gonna impact
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.100]   your value, 'cause it can impact your work.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.820]   And Paul says, man, if you wanna live the new life,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.220]   it involves, you gotta address the lies
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.500]   and embrace the truth, because new living
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.460]   comes and is fueled from new thinking.
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.260]   That if you wanna address your behavior,
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.260]   you've gotta also address the truth.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.540]   If you wanna address your behavior,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.860]   you've gotta also address the belief,
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.580]   'cause belief fuels behavior.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.860]   And this is how people change.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.180]   It's like I've said, it's not just everybody else
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.900]   around you is trying harder.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.380]   The way that Christians transform biblically
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:39.500]   is by having the way that they think about life changed
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.100]   and having it shaped by the Bible and what God's word says.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.380]   And when that begins to happen,
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.580]   their life begins to change.
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.700]   And Paul says some very specific ways
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.820]   that it begins to change, and that's where he goes next.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.340]   Where he says, "Therefore, each one of you
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:06.260]   "must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.920]   "for we are all members of one body.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.740]   "In your anger, do not sin and do not let the sun go down
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.240]   "while you're still angry.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.840]   "And do not give the devil a foothold.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.900]   "He who has been stealing must no longer steal,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.520]   "but must work and do something useful with his own hands,
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.740]   "that he may have something to share with those in need.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.100]   "Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths,
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.880]   "but only what is helpful for building others up
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.860]   "according to their needs,
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.980]   "so that it may benefit those who listen.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.000]   "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.920]   "with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.000]   "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.300]   "brawling, and slander, along with every form of malice
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.920]   "or ill will towards someone.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.680]   "Instead, be kind, compassionate to one another,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.740]   "forgiving each other, just as Christ,
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.160]   "just as in Christ, God forgave you."
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.940]   Now, Paul lays out a number of different behaviors,
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.300]   and he gives these instructions,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.560]   and we can walk through those,
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.420]   but you notice at the end of the instructions,
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.220]   he says two pretty profound things.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.700]   He says, "Hey, you're to talk this way,
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.500]   "and live this way, and think this way, and be this way,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.740]   "because you were sealed with the Spirit of God."
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.060]   And then he brings up forgiveness,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.040]   and he says, "You forgive, and you don't hold grudges
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.220]   "because you have been forgiven,
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.700]   "not you will be forgiven if you do these things,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.060]   "that you have been forgiven.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.760]   "Not you will be sealed if you do these things.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.720]   "The Spirit of God will not leave you.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.000]   "He has sealed you eternally.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.560]   "You have been given a new position,
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.220]   "and that leads to new practice in your life,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.840]   "that you and I, if you are in Jesus,
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.600]   "you have been placed in a position that is eternal,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.680]   "that is immovable, that nothing you do or don't do
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.480]   "in this life will ever change,
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.760]   "that you have been adopted into the family of God,
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.700]   "and that new position is what leads to new practice."
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.540]   That's the third point.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.820]   New practice comes from a new position.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.100]   You don't work for that, you don't work for it.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.460]   Man, as long as you're good enough,
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.480]   and you read enough, and you obey enough,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.380]   then the Spirit of God, then you will be sealed,
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.300]   and then he'll seal you.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.120]   No, you are sealed, so live from that.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   You are forgiven, so live from that.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.840]   That his argument is unlike most operating systems
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.920]   in this world, which is, hey, if you wanna be accepted,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.300]   you better work and you better do enough,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.920]   and he says, no, no, no, you have been accepted,
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.520]   and now you live from that, not for that,
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.680]   'cause new position is what brings about new practice.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   One thing I don't miss about this stage
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.440]   that a lot of you guys are in right now
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.120]   is the dating phase.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.000]   My wife and I have been married 10 years,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.400]   and we still date, but I just mean the dating phase
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.120]   where you're basically in an interview all the time,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   and you're trying to put your best foot forward with them,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.320]   and if you're dating in the room right now,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.160]   this is happening.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.200]   You won't admit it to each other,
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.400]   but it's for sure happening,
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.860]   and what's going on is every week,
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.880]   you're trying to make sure that you present yourself
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.840]   in the best way, 'cause the relationship
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.960]   is not totally secure, 'cause you're still dating.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.640]   You haven't put a ring on it,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.320]   and you're not married yet,
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.600]   so you're trying to present yourself as best as possible,
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.040]   so when you're catching up, and he's like,
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.320]   what do you got going on Saturday?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.200]   And you're like, well, I'm doing what I do every Saturday.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.920]   I wake up at five, I read the Bible for four hours,
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.400]   go to a baking class, then I work out again,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.840]   and you're trying to put your best foot forward,
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.520]   and he is too, and he's trying to be like,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.100]   you know, and show that, you know, I'm a provider,
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.520]   and I'm gonna be a great dad, and look at this,
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.940]   I'm always with my nephew over here.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.480]   I love kids, and he's trying to put his best foot forward
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.120]   too, because the relationship is not secure,
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.560]   and there's just a fear, and so you're getting into hobbies
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.760]   that you don't care about the Dallas Cowboys, you don't,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.400]   but he does, and so you're like, yeah, go to 'em boys,
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   and you're putting on, basically, an attempt
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.240]   to secure that relationship, and it's natural,
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.080]   and it's normal, and I guess it's just a part of it,
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.040]   but then marriage comes, and what I love about marriage
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.480]   is that you're not doing any of those things,
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.200]   and I don't love my wife, and care for my wife,
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   and you know, get a mini-van for my wife.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.880]   In order to secure that relationship, it is secure,
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.560]   that I'm living from that, not for that,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.040]   and the Bible says that you and I have a new position,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.440]   and that leads you to change, you knowing
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.280]   that there is nothing you could ever do
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.120]   if you were in Christ, only if you were in Christ,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.700]   if you trusted in Jesus as the Lord and Savior,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.040]   the payment for your sin, there is nothing
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   you could ever do that will move you away from him,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   or cause him to move away from you.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.300]   You are adopted into the family of God.
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.040]   No matter what sin you do, three weeks from now,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.840]   three hours from now, anything, and Paul says
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.760]   that doesn't lead us to run from God.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.080]   The more you and I grow spiritually and mature,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.560]   that leads you to run to him.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.860]   How amazing is this God that loves me in spite of me?
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.580]   And that new position brings about new practice,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.460]   and he begins to lay out some of what those are,
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.980]   and he says it begins to impact your life.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.500]   We don't lie to each other, and it's not just
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.040]   that we don't lie, we speak the truth in love,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.020]   and he begins to give some corresponding things.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.840]   He says we don't sin in our anger, we resolve conflict.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.120]   We don't let the devil have a foothold in our heart.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.120]   We don't steal, rather we work in order to give.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.540]   The transformation is thorough.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.660]   He's not just saying, hey, we no longer steal.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.360]   He's saying, no, we stop stealing,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.460]   which would include anyone today who at their employer
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.420]   or any time at their workplace is taking advantage
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.740]   and not fully working by scrolling through
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.020]   whatever social media in the middle of the day
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.720]   and wasting or taking advantage of your employer.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.380]   They would be taking away, but he says,
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.820]   no, no, no, we don't steal, we don't do any of that.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.780]   Rather, we work in order to give.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.980]   He says, let the thief no longer steal,
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.900]   but let him work so that he would have something
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.020]   to give other people.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.180]   The transformation is thorough.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.260]   He says it affects the way that we talk.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.980]   We don't let any unwholesome talk come out of our mouth,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.500]   but only what is helpful for building other people up.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.400]   That we're people who use our words to build people up.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.880]   And the more that you and I follow Jesus
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.520]   and our mind is renewed and we live from that identity
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.480]   and that security that we have in Christ,
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.720]   Paul says, this is what God will continue to bring about.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.760]   This is the new life that God will establish.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.080]   We don't grieve the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.600]   That's just a way of describing the conviction
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.320]   that comes about when we live in a way
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.780]   that's inconsistent with what God says.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.560]   If there are not times, and I say this as lovingly as I can,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.120]   if you're a believer, the Bible says
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.000]   the Spirit of God indwells you.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.040]   You have the Holy Spirit living in you,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.640]   directing, convicting, leading.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:11.960]   If you can't think of a time where you did something,
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.660]   you took an action and you felt convicted
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.400]   and thought, man, I shouldn't have said it that way
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.180]   or I should have not communicated that
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.520]   or I don't know that I should have handled it that way,
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.380]   and the Spirit convicted you.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.080]   If in recent memory, just in memory,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.420]   you can't think of a time where you acted,
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.560]   not 'cause you wanted to, but because the conviction of God
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.840]   pressed on your heart.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.800]   That's concerning.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.560]   He says, man, the Spirit of God is gonna lead
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.640]   and the one who has sealed you,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.640]   and he's not leading you to say,
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.440]   if you don't follow me, I'm leaving.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:55.520]   Now Paul says, we follow him knowing he's not leaving,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.400]   that we have a security and that new position
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.800]   that is secure leads to new practices,
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.880]   and then finally he says, get rid of all bitterness,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.920]   all anger, rage, brawling, and slander,
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.200]   along with every type of malice,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.120]   and be kind and compassionate,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.000]   forgiving each other,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.480]   just as in Christ, God forgave you.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.600]   It's a beautiful instruction.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.000]   And what's interesting is, Paul is saying,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.080]   and man, as you follow Jesus, let the Spirit lead,
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.720]   you renew your thinking,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.520]   the transformation is not just thorough,
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.800]   it touches everything.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.840]   And eventually, as you and I follow,
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.000]   that's what Jesus is doing,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.480]   he's touching everything to bring life
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.040]   to everything in your life, every arena,
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.160]   every aspect, the dating, spending, everything.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.200]   A couple weeks ago, there was a hurricane
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.280]   that hit Florida, as we all saw,
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.760]   and some of those homes had water that flood into them.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.720]   You know what's interesting about water
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.880]   when it floods into a home?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.760]   It spreads throughout the entire home evenly.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.560]   In other words, it doesn't just go to one bedroom
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.840]   and then it stops, or it just, it builds up in there,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.400]   and then it decides, I'm gonna go into the kitchen,
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.760]   and I'm probably gonna stay out of the playroom over there.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.440]   It fills and it spreads and touches everything.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.160]   And this is what Christ, as he and you and I follow him,
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.320]   that he wants to flood in and touch everything.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.980]   And the more that you and I journey with Jesus,
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.120]   that's what he's doing,
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.760]   not to control, but to bring life about.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.320]   And Paul says, man, the new you,
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.900]   man, it's, God is gonna bring life everywhere.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:49.000]   'Cause your new identity is gonna lead to new activity.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.100]   Your new position is gonna lead to new practice,
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.280]   and your new thinking is gonna bring about,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.700]   and it's how God brings about new living.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:06.360]   Paul's words, as it relates to the security we have,
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.840]   is a really important message for someone in here to hear.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.080]   'Cause maybe you grew up in church,
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   and you were told that in order for you
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.320]   to have a good standing with God,
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.400]   or you and God to be good,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.960]   that you have gotta do good things.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.320]   Now, God leads us to do and brings good
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.400]   about through our lives,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.760]   but that's not how we have a relationship with him.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.080]   The way that he transforms us is through his grace.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.960]   It's the biblical word, the Christian word
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.080]   that we use to describe,
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.060]   I don't deserve God's favor in my life,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.920]   I don't deserve to have a relationship,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.440]   but just by trusting in Jesus,
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.600]   I get to have one.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.680]   And that security leads us to live for him,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.400]   and begins to change us.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.880]   In the 1930s, there was a bridge
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.060]   that began to be built in San Francisco.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.260]   You may have heard it, and seen the Golden State Bridge.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.080]   It's almost, Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.760]   It's almost two miles long.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.640]   Go Warriors.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.720]   It's almost two miles long.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.000]   It's 750 feet up in the air.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.440]   In 1930s, they began to create this.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.040]   And during the construction, about halfway through,
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   or they reached the halfway point,
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.080]   and men had fallen,
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   it was primarily men who were working on it,
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.360]   23 men had lost their life falling hundreds of feet
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.240]   into the frigid, cold waters of the San Francisco Bay.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:30.920]   And so, for the second half of the bridge,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.720]   they decided, we're gonna put a net underneath.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:36.620]   Now, if 23 had fallen without a net,
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.720]   not knowing that they would be secure,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   how many would fall when there is a net,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.440]   knowing that, hey, even if I end up falling off of this,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.600]   this net will catch me?
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.440]   You would think it would be more.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.580]   It's 23 without it, only 10 with it.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.240]   And not only that, the productivity,
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.920]   and the time, and the ability,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.880]   and ways that they worked increased by about 25%.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.600]   Knowing that the net was there to catch them,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   even if they fall, didn't lead to more people falling,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.340]   it led to less.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.460]   It didn't lead to less productivity, it led to more.
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.940]   They did the opposite of what you would think,
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.580]   and yet this is exactly what happens as followers of Jesus.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.420]   Knowing that the net of God's grace will catch me,
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.280]   even if I fall, there is nothing that can change.
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.500]   Where I stand with God doesn't lead me
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   to be less in love, less passionate, less following of him.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   It leads to more, because I have a security
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.980]   that nothing in this world can change.
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:45.000]   And your behavior, it's not whosoever behaves
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.800]   has eternal life, it is whosoever believes
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.400]   will not perish but have eternal life.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.960]   God's love for you doesn't have anything to do with you.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.380]   It has everything to do with the relationship
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.380]   that he has opened the door through his son, Jesus.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.840]   And he loves you so much, despite your behavior,
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.320]   that he would give his life on a cross for you.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.660]   And some of you are in the room tonight, just listen to me.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.080]   The reason you are here is because for so long
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.720]   you have thought that God is a God who if you fall,
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.000]   he'll catch you, he'll get you in trouble.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.040]   If you mess up, he's out to get you.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.580]   And a better way of saying it would be,
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.140]   the truth is God is a God who has said,
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.380]   you're gonna fall and I'm gonna catch you
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.880]   with the net of my grace.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.620]   And I have opened the door for that to happen
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.640]   through Jesus.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.780]   And he is inviting you into that relationship with him
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.020]   to experience the new life, the life you were made for.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.420]   And there's only one way for that to happen.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:54.220]   And that's you deciding I am no longer gonna live,
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.520]   I'm gonna follow my own ways.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.360]   Could it be true, God, you're actually real?
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.040]   That I know in my heart of hearts,
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.800]   there's something broken, there's an emptiness I can't fix.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.880]   And I know I'm not good enough
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.680]   to have a relationship with you.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.440]   And if it's true, 2,000 years ago, you sent your son
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.760]   and he reset the calendar and he changed the world
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.720]   and he looks like he's changing a lot of worlds around me.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.440]   God, I believe that.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.720]   And I receive you as my Lord and my Savior.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.300]   And there is no bigger and more important decision
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.880]   than you will ever make,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.320]   because it's only by making that decision first,
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.080]   you're positioned before God permanent.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.580]   And that leads to a change
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.140]   in how you practice and live your life.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:52.340]   It's the new you, the new life.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.440]   New identity, new thinking,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.680]   and a new position that leads to new practice.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.520]   Let me pray.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:05.100]   Father, I do pray for anyone listening right now
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.580]   at the 11 other live locations,
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.340]   anyone in this room right now,
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.900]   who I don't know their name, but you do.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.740]   I don't know their story, but you do.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.760]   And you don't just know them, you love them.
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.580]   And you love them so much, you gave your life for them.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:26.420]   Father, we ask that you would allow them to take that step
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:31.340]   and say, God, I receive you, I'm a sinner.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.060]   And I trust in what you did,
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:38.340]   for sending your son as the payment for my sin
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.940]   and dying in my place, the eternal sacrifice
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:49.500]   for me, who then rose from the dead,
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.900]   rose from the dead, and give you my life.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:58.900]   Make it new, make it yours, make it like Jesus.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   Father, I pray for all of us in the room
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.660]   who have trusted in you, and we just,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.380]   with open hearts, we invite you, God,
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.820]   would you take more ground?
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.220]   Would you make us more like Jesus?
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.420]   Would you start with me?
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.420]   More of the new life would be experienced and lived out.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:29.980]   We thank you, God.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.820]   We worship our King, now in song, amen.
