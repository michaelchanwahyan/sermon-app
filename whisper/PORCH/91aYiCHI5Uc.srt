00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,720
 Wow, yeah.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
 Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,720
 [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,720
 I can't believe this. Thank you.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,720
 So good to be back at the porch so soon.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,720
 It's amazing I was here just before the end of the year last year.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,720
 And so great to be back with Sean and Mel and Passion tonight.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,720
 We're just kind of cruising around the country for a few weeks,

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,720
 dropping in on campuses and into gatherings like the porch.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
 And so thanks for having us.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 We're actually just kind of coming to bring Passion to people.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,720
 We are having two big Passion gatherings in a few months,

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,720
 one of them here in the Metroplex, which we're pumped about,

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
 and one in Atlanta, Georgia.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 But we're not really here to sell that tonight because both of them

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
 are almost sold out as we speak right now.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,720
 So it would be impossible for all of you to come to Passion

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 at Dallas-Fort Worth right now.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,720
 So we're excited about that, but we're really just excited about tonight.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,720
 So, David, thanks for having us. Thanks for having me.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,720
 Grateful to be at the porch and be under your leadership tonight.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,720
 Pretty awesome that my friend T.A. has become part of the team here

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
 since I was here last time, if you're a watermark person,

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 and that's pretty great.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
 So a smattering of applause.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,720
 T.A., I think, might be here, so maybe he wanted to hear

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
 just a little more enthusiasm than that.

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 [cheers and applause]

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 I don't know if he's here. He was here, but I'm hoping he left early

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 because that was heartbreaking.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 Anyway, it's good to be here tonight, and I just want to really put

33
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,720
 a big idea on the table.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 And I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the biggest idea

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 that's on your table.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
 And I know there are a lot of big things on your table.

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,720
 People gathered all over America linking into this right now.

38
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 A lot of people in their first job, second job.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720
 Anybody in your first or second job that's here tonight?

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
 Okay, anybody in your ninth job already that are going by fast

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
 or clicking along?

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 Anybody need a job that's here tonight, and you're like,

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 "I'd really love to be in my first or second job."

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,720
 Anybody in a relationship here, you know, like a meaningful,

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
 potential, could-be-lifelong relationship here?

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 Okay, they're all pointing at you. Congratulations. That's amazing.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 I didn't even know those people existed anymore.

48
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
 I'm a little out of touch with how things are working these days.

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 Anybody want to be in a relationship this here night?

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
 You're like, "Louie, why do you think we came to the porch?

51
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,720
 You think we love Jesus that much? No!

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,720
 We're here hoping for a miracle."

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 You need healing? No, I need somebody.

54
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,720
 You need a breakthrough? No, I need somebody.

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 A lot of people here are going through struggle.

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 You're asking big questions.

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 You want to know if you're on the right track.

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 You want to know if you're in the flow of what God has for your life.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,720
 Some of you are not even sure if God has a flow for your life.

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 But I'm telling you there's something bigger than all that,

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
 bigger than whether you're in the right grad program,

62
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 you're in the right job, you're on the right track,

63
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 you're in the right career, you're possibly going to meet somebody

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,720
 or figure out what it is that God really has for you to do in life.

65
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 And there's something bigger than all that.

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,720
 And the thing that's bigger than all that is crazy.

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 And I don't want to hype it up too much, but it's crazy.

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
 And the reason why we won't all fall on the floor in a minute

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 when we start talking more specifically about it

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 is because a lot of us have been around it too much.

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
 And we've been around church too much.

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
 We've been around things like tonight too much

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 to really take a step back and be absolutely blown away by this idea.

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
 Are you ready for it?

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,720
 Yahweh, that's the God of gods, the one true God,

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,720
 the creator of the cosmos and everything that exists.

77
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,720
 That all powerful forever existing being

78
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 who needs nothing and has never needed anyone,

79
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,720
 who dwells in absolute bright, glorious light

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,720
 is inviting you to come as close to him as you want to

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 and to know as much about him as you're willing to come and see.

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,720
 I like that.

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 (congregation cheering)

84
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,720
 Can we just let that sink in for a minute, David?

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,720
 Yahweh has opened the way

86
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,720
 for you to come up the mountain

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,720
 and see the glory of God.

88
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 I went to grad school in Fort Worth, Texas.

89
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 I was going to say Fort Worth, Texas, but you know where Fort Worth is.

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 (congregation laughing)

91
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 I don't speak a lot of other places.

92
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
 I went to grad school in Fort Worth.

93
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 And it was in another lifetime ago.

94
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
 It was before anything.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
 So whatever there is, it was before all that.

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 Phones were stuck on the wall

97
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,720
 and there was no technology of any kind.

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 There was no social media.

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 There was nothing.

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 And I was sitting in the library one night, as I would be,

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 about nine o'clock,

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,720
 and I was dating my now wife, who's a student at Baylor.

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 And she was at Baylor,

104
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
 but I didn't know what she was doing at Baylor

105
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
 because I couldn't text her.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 I couldn't check her feed.

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
 I couldn't call her on my cell phone.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
 So I don't know what she was doing.

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 Probably some frat boy chasing her down, for all I know,

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 because everybody at the school was after her.

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 And I'm sitting here reading church history

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
 and I'm thinking about her being,

113
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 her dorm was 68.2 miles away from the campus.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 And specifically, and I thought, you know,

115
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
 I could make a move right now.

116
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
 So I just packed all my stuff up, got in my car

117
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
 and just started down I-35.

118
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
 And I said, I'm going.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 I don't know what's happening.

120
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 I don't know what she's doing, but I'm about to find out.

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
 So she was living in Memorial Dorm at the time.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 So I pull onto campus, pull up to Memorial Dorm.

123
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
 I'd stopped on the way.

124
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
 I didn't have hardly any money.

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
 Maybe had 10 bucks on me, probably.

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 No debit cards back then, sorry.

127
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
 I mean, it's another lifetime.

128
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
 I know it's hard to really get your head in that space,

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
 but it's just another world, another era.

130
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,720
 I'm coming to you from another time, okay?

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
 And so I stopped at the gas station

132
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 when I get off the freeway and I buy two Hawaiian punches.

133
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
 I know that doesn't even make sense.

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 Does anybody even know what that is?

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 Does that exist anymore?

136
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
 Okay, well, that was our thing.

137
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
 That was our thing.

138
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 Our thing was Hawaiian punch.

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
 So I buy two Hawaiian punches.

140
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 I go park, I walk down the sidewalk,

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 I go in Memorial Dorm.

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
 There's a dorm lady who sits at a little desk

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 and she runs the show.

144
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,720
 So I walk up to her and I set the two cans on the counter

145
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 and I say, "Can you call up to Shelly Graves' room?"

146
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
 Hoping she's up there.

147
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 It's about, you know, now it's like 10.30.

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
 And I say, "And can you tell her

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 "that someone left something for her at the desk?"

150
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
 She says, "Absolutely."

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
 So she picks up the phone, she starts dialing.

152
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
 I go around, you know, through the lobby,

153
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 go behind a plant over here

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 where I can barely see the counter

155
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 and I'm just waiting it out.

156
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 And so sure enough, she comes down,

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 she sees the two cans on the counter.

158
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
 She knows that I have arrived.

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 And so she starts looking around

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,720
 and I pop out from behind the plant

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 and we have a big handshake.

162
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 (congregation laughing)

163
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 It's a Baptist school.

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 And so we shake hands and we sit out on the steps

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 with our Hawaiian punches

166
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,720
 and she has a major test the next morning.

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 She's up there just like studying like crazy

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
 and she's like, "I gotta keep studying,

169
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
 "but this is amazing."

170
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
 And we drank the Hawaiian punches.

171
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
 Please, somebody give me bear witness, if you know

172
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,720
 anything about the atmosphere I'm in right now.

173
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
 We drank the Hawaiian punches.

174
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
 We sat shoulder to shoulder on the steps

175
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 in front of the dorm.

176
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
 I put my arm around her.

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
 She said, "This is so great.

178
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
 "You're so sweet.

179
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 "Thank you so much for coming."

180
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
 I said, "I just was thinking about you

181
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 "in the middle of studying

182
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
 "and I thought I can get there."

183
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 And so I love you and do great on your test.

184
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 15 minutes had transpired and I'm back in the car

185
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
 (congregation laughing)

186
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 heading back to Fort Worth, Texas.

187
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 'Cause I got stuff too.

188
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 I got an eight o'clock class also.

189
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,720
 And I'm rolling back into my apartment.

190
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,720
 It's like, I don't know, 1230 for 15 minutes.

191
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 Anybody ever been there before?

192
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
 Anybody ever been there?

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 No, nobody's ever had this experience?

194
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 Really?

195
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 Oh my gosh, dear Lord.

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 I wanna pray for these people tonight.

197
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 Have you never done anything that didn't make any sense?

198
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 No, no, no, not in life.

199
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 (congregation laughing)

200
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,720
 Because you were so fixated on somebody

201
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:39,720
 that an hour and a half drive for a 15 minute moment

202
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,720
 seemed like the most reasonable thing on earth.

203
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 But yet you flip the equation a little bit

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 and we've got Yahweh who's saying,

205
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,720
 "I've made a way for you to come

206
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,720
 as close to me as you want to.

207
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,720
 And you can know my glory."

208
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,720
 I wanna take us back to a story in the Old Testament.

209
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
 If you have your scripture,

210
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
 I'm gonna drop down into a verse

211
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
 that God really put in my heart for these nights.

212
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
 And it's Exodus 34, two.

213
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 But let me give us a little context.

214
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 We're talking about Moses.

215
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
 Moses, you remember Moses.

216
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,720
 His mom put him in a basket, put him in the river.

217
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
 He's raised in Pharaoh's household.

218
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 Eventually, because of his defense of his own people

219
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 being persecuted by the Pharaoh,

220
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
 he has to flee out into the wilderness.

221
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
 And after a long time, God finds him in the wilderness

222
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 and says, "Moses, I'm gonna use you

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
 to deliver my people from Egypt."

224
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 And he does.

225
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 And so they go through the Red Sea.

226
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
 They have a cloud by day and fire by night.

227
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
 And now they're in the wilderness

228
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 tracking along with God.

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 And God is working his plan out

230
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
 through this man called Moses.

231
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,720
 And eventually, he invites Moses up on Mount Sinai,

232
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
 the holy mountain of God.

233
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
 Now, this is the gospel, by the way.

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 If you just got here and you don't know why we're here,

235
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 this part of the story is the gospel part of the story

236
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 that we're all celebrating tonight.

237
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 There was a mountain in the wilderness called Mount Sinai.

238
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
 It was the holy place of God.

239
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
 God had even established it as so and said,

240
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
 "Don't anybody come near this mountain.

241
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 Don't touch it or you'll die."

242
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
 This is God's holy mountain.

243
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 But he invited Moses up on the mountain.

244
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,720
 This is a precursor to him inviting you

245
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 and inviting me through Jesus

246
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
 to come into the holy place of God.

247
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
 And if somebody did amen that tonight,

248
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 I'm just gonna park right here.

249
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 We are invited through Jesus into,

250
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
 not into church, not into a thing,

251
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 not into some kind of religion,

252
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,720
 but we're invited into the holy place of God

253
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 through the finished work of Jesus Christ.

254
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 Anybody can come.

255
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
 A felon can come.

256
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
 The best person in town can come.

257
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
 The nicest person on the planet can come.

258
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
 The biggest failure can come.

259
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
 Anybody can come.

260
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
 An atheist can come.

261
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 A person who grew up in a Christian home can come.

262
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 Somebody with a broken story can come.

263
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
 Somebody who's doing pretty good can come.

264
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,720
 Anybody through Jesus can come up the holy mountain of God.

265
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 And you don't have to come up that mountain

266
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 on your own merit.

267
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 Jesus has made a way.

268
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 But even in the Old Testament,

269
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
 God's tipping his hand.

270
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
 And he says to Moses,

271
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
 I'm inviting you up on the mountain.

272
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 Bring two stone tablets with you

273
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 and meet me on the mountain.

274
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 And he came up the mountain of God.

275
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
 Stayed up there a while.

276
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
 He's up there longer than people thought

277
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
 he was gonna be up there.

278
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
 He's got God's laws written on stone

279
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 by the hand of God.

280
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 And when he finally comes down the mountain,

281
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
 the people, they thought, well, he's never coming back.

282
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 So they decided, I don't know where they got this crazy idea

283
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
 to melt down all their jewelry

284
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,720
 and make a golden calf and worship the golden calf.

285
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,720
 Moses is up on the mountain of God's glory.

286
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 They're down here dancing around a golden calf.

287
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 Isn't that dumb?

288
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,720
 Can you imagine being that stupid?

289
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 That you could be up on the mountain in God's glory

290
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
 and instead you're down dancing around a golden calf?

291
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 Isn't that the dumbest thing you could ever think of?

292
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 Oh, no, it's not actually that dumb, is it?

293
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 He comes down, he sees the calf,

294
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,720
 he throws his tablets down, they smash on the ground.

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 He tells the people to destroy the idol because why?

296
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 He's been up on the mountain of God.

297
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 And I'm telling you, God is inviting you up the mountain.

298
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
 Once he came down, a few things transpired.

299
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,720
 In chapter 33, one of the greatest chapters in the Bible,

300
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
 one of the most pivotal chapters in scripture

301
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,720
 for me in my life and following Jesus,

302
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
 A, he's in the tent of meeting with God,

303
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 this tent that they carry through the wilderness.

304
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
 And it says when he went in the tent of meeting,

305
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,720
 Moses, the cloud of God's glory would come down on the tent

306
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
 and they would talk, it says,

307
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
 like a friend talks to his friend.

308
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
 And it wasn't like he was seeing God face to face,

309
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
 but that's how intimate they were.

310
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
 Yahweh was talking to Moses

311
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
 like we talk to each other face to face.

312
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
 And then Moses would leave the tent

313
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 and the cloud would disperse from the tent.

314
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
 It says, but his young aid, Joshua, he wouldn't leave

315
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 because he couldn't get enough of this idea

316
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,720
 that God, Yahweh, the creator would meet

317
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,720
 with a man or with a woman.

318
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
 And then the conversation unfolds of what happened there.

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
 And it was Moses saying,

320
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
 you've told us that you're gonna lead us on,

321
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 but how are people gonna know we're your people

322
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
 when we go on?

323
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
 And God said, well, I'm gonna go with you.

324
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,720
 And this was one of the greatest lines

325
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 in all of scripture to me.

326
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
 And Moses said, well, of course you're gonna go with us

327
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,720
 because if you don't go with us, we're not going.

328
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 But then he asked for something else.

329
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
 He said, I wanna ask you one more thing.

330
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,720
 See the progression?

331
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 How people gonna know we're different?

332
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 God said, I'm going with you.

333
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
 He said, okay, well, we're not going

334
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
 if you're not going with us.

335
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
 Wouldn't that be amazing?

336
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
 We just parked right there tonight.

337
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 I'm not going if you're not going with me.

338
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
 I'm not getting in this relationship

339
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
 if you're not getting in the relationship.

340
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 I'm not getting on this path if you're not on this path.

341
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
 I'm not investing time and energy in this thing

342
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
 if you're not investing time and energy in this thing.

343
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 If you're not going, I'm not going.

344
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
 It's not like, hey, I love you

345
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 and I'll check in with you later.

346
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
 I got some other paths to get on.

347
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 It's like, no, if you're not getting on the path,

348
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
 I'm not getting on the path.

349
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,720
 But then he said, it's not enough for me

350
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 to know that you're going with me.

351
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 I think for the average believer,

352
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 the conversation could have ended right there

353
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 and we'd be fine.

354
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
 God said, he's going with us, we're good.

355
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 But Moses said, no, that's not enough for me.

356
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
 And then he took his shot.

357
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 I love it.

358
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,720
 He just took his shot.

359
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 And he said, no, show me your glory.

360
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 I'm glad that you're going,

361
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,720
 but I want to see your glory.

362
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
 And I just wonder tonight at the porch

363
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 where we are gathered all over the nation tonight,

364
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 is there somebody at the porch that says,

365
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 it's not enough for me that God is going to bless my way.

366
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,720
 I want God more than I want God to bless.

367
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 To bless my way.

368
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
 Has anybody today taken a shot with heaven

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 and said to God almighty, show me your glory.

370
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,720
 I'm telling you, God didn't even think about it.

371
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,720
 He said, okay, okay.

372
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 But I'm going to have to stick you in a crack of a rock

373
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,720
 and I'm about to put my hand on top of you.

374
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
 And then I'm going to let my goodness pass by you.

375
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,720
 And I'm going to let you see the back of me going by.

376
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
 Because if I don't do that, you won't make it off the mountain.

377
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 You'll be obliterated by my glory, but come on.

378
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
 And then this verse, I love it.

379
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
 In chapter 34, he says in verse two,

380
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 be ready in the morning and then come up on Mount Sinai.

381
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 Be ready in the morning and come up the holy mountain.

382
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,720
 I'm inviting you up the mountain of God.

383
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 And then he says to him, present yourself to me

384
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 there on top of the mountain.

385
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 If I put a title on this message tonight,

386
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
 it would be next level.

387
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
 It's the crazy idea that God is saying the very same thing

388
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 to you and me because of Jesus

389
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 that he was saying to Moses on this day.

390
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
 Get ready in the morning.

391
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,720
 And if you want to come up Mount Sinai and present yourself.

392
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
 God, here I am.

393
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
 I wasn't satisfied down on the lower level.

394
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
 I wasn't satisfied at the lodge with the hot chocolate.

395
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,720
 I wasn't satisfied at the lookout we could drive to.

396
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 I came all the way up to the top of the mountain

397
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,720
 and I am presenting myself here before you today saying,

398
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 I want to see and taste the glory of God.

399
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,720
 I don't want any less than you.

400
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,720
 I just want you.

401
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 I think so many times we stop with, I need God's help.

402
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
 I need God's direction.

403
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 I need God's input.

404
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 I need God's discernment.

405
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
 I need God's wisdom.

406
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
 I need God's truth.

407
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 I need God's principle.

408
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 I need God's blessing.

409
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
 And all those things are great.

410
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
 But God loves the heart that says more than the blessing,

411
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 more than the wisdom, more than the insight,

412
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
 more than the truth, more than the principle, I want you.

413
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 It's like the psalmist who encouraged us,

414
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 delight yourself in the Lord and he'll give you the desires

415
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
 of your heart.

416
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,720
 And I read that about three weeks ago and I was like,

417
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 oh my word, if I don't have everything my heart desires,

418
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 it's on me.

419
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,720
 Because I have the option of delighting myself in the Lord.

420
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
 I can't delight you in the Lord,

421
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 but I can delight myself in the Lord.

422
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
 And when I delight myself in the Lord,

423
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,720
 he promises to give me the desires of my heart.

424
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
 I think the way that equation works, by the way,

425
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 is that the more I say, I just want you,

426
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 the more my heart turns into being satisfied completely

427
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
 in him.

428
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 And I get in him everything that I've desired

429
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,720
 because he is all that I need.

430
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 We were created by God and for God, Colossians.

431
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 And I pray like you've been studying in Ephesians chapter one

432
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
 that God would open the eyes of our heart

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
 and give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation

434
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 and the knowledge of God that we might know him better.

435
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 Revelation is what happens when the Holy Spirit

436
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 takes information and blows it up in our heart

437
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
 and in our mind.

438
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,720
 And what we knew now is absolutely vivid in our hearts

439
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,720
 and it is capturing our desire and our total imagination.

440
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,720
 And we move toward God like we've never moved before.

441
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
 I pray that tonight in God,

442
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
 I pray in the name of Jesus right now

443
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
 across all the porch gatherings

444
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
 that you would give a spirit of wisdom

445
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
 and revelation and the knowledge of God.

446
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,720
 I pray that someone's eyes will be open.

447
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 The eyes of their heart will be enlightened

448
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
 that they may know you more.

449
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 Why?

450
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
 Because he's better.

451
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 He's better.

452
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 David said it this way in Psalm 27 verse four.

453
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 He said, "One thing I ask of the Lord."

454
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 Man, how clarifying is that?

455
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
 "And that will I seek."

456
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
 One thing.

457
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 If you give me one thing, one shot, one opportunity,

458
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
 what am I gonna put at the end of that?

459
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 Dear God, please, what's gonna go in that blank?

460
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
 He said, "I'll tell you what's in my blank.

461
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 "If I get one shot, one thing I'm gonna ask of the Lord,

462
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 "one thing I'm gonna seek,

463
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 "that I may dwell in the house of the Lord

464
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
 "all the days of my life."

465
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
 Check this phrase,

466
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 "To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord

467
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,720
 "and to meditate in his temple."

468
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
 If I get one shot, I just want you.

469
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,720
 I think the question tonight is, what is my one shot?

470
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
 What's your one shot?

471
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
 What's your one thing?

472
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,720
 If it all comes down to this, what is the this?

473
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,720
 If it all comes down to this, what is the this?

474
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
 And is it truly for me that this is,

475
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,720
 I just want you.

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 I think it starts tonight with you seeing

477
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
 that that's his this.

478
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 He just wants you.

479
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 Of course he has a will for your life

480
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
 and a purpose and a plan.

481
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
 Of course he gave you gifts, abilities,

482
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 aptitudes and opportunities.

483
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,720
 Of course he wants to use you to impact your generation,

484
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
 your neighborhood, your community,

485
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 your place of work, your family.

486
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
 Of course he wants you to leave a legacy

487
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
 for his glory on planet earth.

488
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 Of course he has work for you to do.

489
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
 Of course he wants to give you meaning in life.

490
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,720
 But more than all of that stuff,

491
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 he just wants you

492
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 to the degree that Jesus made a way

493
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
 for you to come up the holy mountain.

494
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
 Come up the holy mountain of God.

495
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,720
 And this is the most mind blowing thought of all.

496
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
 You can go as high as you want to go.

497
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,720
 A.W. Toews is a brilliant theologian and preacher.

498
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
 He said it this way.

499
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,720
 Every person is as close to God as they want to be.

500
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 You're like, no, I've had hardship.

501
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 Doesn't matter.

502
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
 Hardship doesn't stop you from being close to God,

503
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 according to Romans.

504
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
 Yeah, but I've had a disappointing life.

505
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 I know, but disappointing lives

506
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
 don't stop us from being close to God.

507
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,720
 They actually propel us to being closer to God.

508
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 But I've been through a lot of pain.

509
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
 I know, and you know what pain does?

510
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
 It pushes us closer to God.

511
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
 Oh, the enemy can use it to push us away from God,

512
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,720
 but the spirit uses pain to push us closer to God.

513
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 I've never been closer to God in my life

514
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
 than the most desperate painful moments that I've walked in,

515
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
 where I had nothing but to absolutely fall

516
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
 in the grace of God.

517
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
 And you know what happened when I did?

518
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
 I found that the grace of God is actually real

519
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,720
 and actually as powerful as we say it is.

520
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
 And if you've lost a loved one

521
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 or held the hand of someone in your family

522
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
 when they took their last breath,

523
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
 or you've gotten a phone call in news,

524
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
 it was absolutely tragic and devastating.

525
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
 You know that the grace of God is real.

526
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
 The love of God is real.

527
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
 The power of God is real.

528
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
 But what about the beauty?

529
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,720
 When's the last time anybody said,

530
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to make it.

531
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
 I've carved out that time to just gaze on the beauty

532
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
 of God.

533
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 When is the last time anybody said,

534
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
 I've only got 15 minutes

535
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
 and it's gonna take me an hour and a half to get there.

536
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
 But when I get there, I'm gonna be there with Yahweh.

537
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
 So I'm gone.

538
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,720
 And when they got back, they were like,

539
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
 absolutely worth it.

540
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 Absolutely worth it.

541
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
 And I just wanna encourage us all in that way.

542
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
 You can go as high on the mountain as you want to.

543
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 There is no place on this mountain that says, I'm sorry,

544
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,720
 authorized personnel only, beyond this point.

545
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,720
 And if I don't make it to glory,

546
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,720
 it's because I didn't want to.

547
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:39,720
 It's because I got sold something less and I took it.

548
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 I'm old and so you would expect me to say this,

549
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,720
 but I'm not in the TikTok promised land yet.

550
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
 I mean, I might be, but it's not because of me.

551
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 Somebody else has put me in the TikTok promised land.

552
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
 But I know the explore page on Instagram.

553
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,720
 And I know that reels are real.

554
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,720
 And I don't know what Instagram thinks about me,

555
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
 but it knows that I love dogs,

556
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
 older dogs that get puppies in boxes.

557
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
 I know that Instagram knows I like that.

558
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 I know that Instagram knows that I like to see yachts

559
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
 on fire apparently, 'cause every day

560
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
 I get another yacht on fire.

561
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
 I know that Instagram knows that I like to see people

562
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 that I don't know, couples that I don't know,

563
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 dancing in their four years.

564
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:39,720
 I don't know what this says about me,

565
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,720
 but Instagram knows I like the outfit of the day.

566
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,720
 I don't even buy women's clothes online,

567
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 but apparently they think I want to.

568
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,720
 And if you drop into that zone,

569
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 does anybody ever get into that world?

570
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,720
 It is amazing, isn't it, how the math works.

571
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,720
 Like you go in there at like 7.40

572
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 and you come out at like 9.10

573
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,720
 and you haven't eaten.

574
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,720
 You've missed, you know, someone coming by the house.

575
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,720
 I'm exaggerating a little bit,

576
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,720
 but it's amazing how little by little,

577
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,720
 TikTok, TikTok, TikTok.

578
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 Maybe there's a reason why it's called TikTok,

579
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,720
 'cause it's TikToking our lives away.

580
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
 And it might be TikToking us to death.

581
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,720
 And I can say this because I'm old

582
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
 and no one will care because I'm old,

583
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 but I was lost in the explore page

584
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
 watching yachts catch on fire.

585
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 Does anybody else,

586
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 Instagram want you to see yachts catching on fire?

587
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
 You're like, I didn't even know that was on there.

588
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 No, it's amazing.

589
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
 It's just phenomenal.

590
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
 Either catching on fire or running over dogs.

591
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
 Either one, I'm fascinated.

592
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,720
 The bigger, the better.

593
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
 120 foot yacht,

594
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 it just ran over a dock and three other yachts.

595
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
 Wow, that is amazing.

596
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
 I'm gonna watch that again.

597
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,720
 And I was lost in the reels.

598
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 And this is true.

599
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
 This is not, I'm not trying to spiritualize.

600
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
 And when I came out of Never Never Land,

601
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,720
 sitting right on the dock,

602
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,720
 sitting right next to me was this.

603
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,720
 And I thought what would happen

604
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,720
 if God's spirit ignited our hearts in such a way

605
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,720
 that we could open this living, breathing miracle.

606
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,720
 And all of a sudden,

607
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,720
 like it was 740 when we went in, I know it was,

608
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 but somehow it was 910 when I came out.

609
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
 And I don't know what happened.

610
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
 I missed a meal.

611
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,720
 I missed two texts.

612
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,720
 I went up the mountain of God.

613
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 That same A.W. Tozer, I was reading,

614
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
 I've read a lot about him in my life,

615
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 but I was reading a story about him.

616
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,720
 He died in the '60s, been gone for a minute.

617
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 But it said, one of the people that worked for him

618
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 said he came in to his office like he would do.

619
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,720
 And he would get in this little corner and pray.

620
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 And they said he's praying in his office.

621
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,720
 And normally that would happen for a bit, an hour or so.

622
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
 But it kept going and he never came out to say,

623
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 "Hey, okay, I'm ready to do the day."

624
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 And so his assistant was sitting out

625
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,720
 where she would normally sit and 11 o'clock came

626
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 and then lunchtime came and then two o'clock came

627
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
 and then five o'clock came.

628
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
 And she finally thought, "I gotta go home."

629
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 So she's packing all her stuff up

630
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 and she doesn't know what's happened.

631
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
 So finally she's very nervously

632
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
 kind of knocks on the door and cracks the door.

633
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
 And A.W. Tozer's in there in the corner with God.

634
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,720
 And she says, "Excuse me, Dr. Tozer."

635
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
 And he kind of startles him a little bit.

636
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
 And she says, "I'm sorry, but,"

637
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,720
 and he said, "What time is it?"

638
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,720
 And she said, "Well, it's quitting time.

639
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,720
 "It's five o'clock and I've got to head home now."

640
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
 And he says, "Oh, I'm so sorry.

641
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,720
 "I had no idea what time it was."

642
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,720
 And I thought, "Have I ever done that one time in my life?

643
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,720
 "That I went up the mountain of God

644
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,720
 "and got into atmosphere in an altitude

645
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
 "in a place with a vista

646
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,720
 "and the revelation of God and His glory

647
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 "and I just completely lost track of everything."

648
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,720
 And I believe that's the generation that God's looking for.

649
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,720
 A generation where somebody steps forward and says,

650
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,720
 "I want one thing.

651
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,720
 "And one thing I'm gonna seek.

652
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 "Oh, I'm gonna get my work done.

653
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 "I'm gonna do well in my company.

654
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
 "I'm gonna try to figure out how to add value

655
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
 "to everything I'm doing.

656
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,720
 "But I'm telling you, I will not be robbed of this one thing.

657
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,720
 "I wanna dwell in the house of the Lord

658
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
 "all the days of my life.

659
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,720
 "And I wanna gaze on the beauty of the Lord

660
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
 "and I wanna meditate in His temple.

661
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
 "I wanna know His glory.

662
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,720
 "I do not wanna be satisfied with knowing about Him.

663
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,720
 "I want Him to be my awe and awe.

664
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,720
 "I wanna say, 'You are my first love.

665
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,720
 "'You are the this in my equation, in my life.'"

666
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
 I'll tell you a couple of things that will happen

667
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
 really fast, we'll close.

668
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
 Number one, your whole worldview will be changed

669
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
 up on the mountain of God.

670
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 Everything will change up there,

671
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
 but it'll all be great

672
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
 because it will be reorganized by the glory of God.

673
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 Secondly, when you come down from the mountain of God,

674
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,720
 you will no longer tolerate any idol

675
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,720
 because you have seen and tasted that the Lord is good.

676
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,720
 And foolishness, this is kind of the phrase

677
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
 God's been putting in my heart.

678
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,720
 Foolishness will have no place.

679
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,720
 You'll come down from the mountain of God

680
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
 and people say, "Hey, you wanna do whatever?"

681
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
 And you'll be like, "No."

682
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
 Right now you have nothing to compare it with.

683
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,720
 It's like, "Okay, I got nothing else happening right now."

684
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
 But when you've been on the mountain of God

685
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
 and you come down and people say,

686
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
 "Well, we're going here."

687
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
 And you're like, "No, I don't think so."

688
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
 "Why?"

689
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
 "Because I don't have a space for foolishness in my life.

690
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,720
 "I get one life, one set of breath.

691
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,720
 "I don't know how many I've got coming through these lungs.

692
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
 "But I promise you one thing,

693
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
 "with these lungs I'm going up the mountain of God

694
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,720
 "and I'm gonna meet Him there, be changed by Him there."

695
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 And here's the last thing about it.

696
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
 When you've been up there, you're gonna be lit.

697
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,720
 You will not have to tell anybody,

698
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
 "Well, you know what, yesterday I was with God.

699
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,720
 "Yesterday I just turned everything off,

700
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
 "closed down all the apps,

701
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
 "decided I was gonna get in the presence of God

702
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
 "and stay there and I did and it was amazing."

703
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
 No, you don't have to give that speech.

704
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 When you've been up Mount Sinai,

705
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
 through Christ you've been on the mountain of God,

706
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
 you will be lit.

707
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,720
 Moses' face glowed from the back of God's goodness

708
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,720
 when his hand covered him in a crack in a rock.

709
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,720
 How much more are our faces going to glow

710
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,720
 when through the Holy Spirit,

711
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,720
 we come into fellowship with God Almighty

712
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
 because of the work of Jesus Christ?

713
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,720
 Paul said, "We're gonna be changed from moment to moment,

714
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
 "from glory to glory

715
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,720
 "and we're not gonna have to worry about our litness fading.

716
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,720
 "We are going to be bright and radiant."

717
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,720
 Those who look to him, the psalmist said, are radiant

718
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,720
 and their faces are never covered in shame.

719
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,720
 I wonder if anybody has got a hunger tonight

720
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,720
 to put down the foolishness

721
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,720
 and to put down this idea of being satisfied

722
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
 with a low level coffee

723
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,720
 when God's inviting you

724
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,720
 to come as high up the mountain as you wanna come.

725
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
 And he'll draw you and pull you

726
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,720
 by a flame that burns within you.

727
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
 But it starts, I think, with us saying,

728
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,720
 "God, I want to come up the mountain."

729
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,720
 I don't know what's gonna have to go,

730
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,720
 but I'm never gonna say I don't have time for God.

731
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,720
 I'm gonna say, "I'm sorry, I don't have time for that.

732
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
 "I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to join y'all for that.

733
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
 "I'm sorry, not gonna be able to get my run in today.

734
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
 "I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to put that

735
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
 "on the schedule today because I promise you,

736
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,720
 "there is one thing, and I'm getting the one thing.

737
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,720
 "I'm getting the one thing."

738
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,720
 If that seems to resonate with you, I wanna pray for you.

739
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
 I don't think it's a lot of people necessarily,

740
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
 but I know there's somebody right now,

741
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
 and your heart is literally beating faster

742
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
 than it was when you got here.

743
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,720
 And you wanna say to God tonight,

744
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,720
 "I want to see, I need to see.

745
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 "I was made to see your glory."

746
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,720
 And I'm sorry that I hadn't made it up very high,

747
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,720
 but if you'll have me, I wanna come, I wanna come.

748
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
 Could you just stand?

749
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
 That's just more for you than for us.

750
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
 Could you just stand if that's you while I pray

751
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
 so I'll know who I'm praying for?

752
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,720
 (gentle music)

753
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,720
 I'll just invite you just to open your hands.

754
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,720
 It's just a way of saying to the Lord, "I'm letting go.

755
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 "Letting go of the thing that I was leaning on

756
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,720
 "to comfort me or to numb me or to entertain me

757
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,720
 "or to distract me, I'm letting go.

758
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,720
 "And what I want is you.

759
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
 "I just want you."

760
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
 Lord, I really can't organize a journey

761
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:30,720
 for anybody but me.

762
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,720
 But Holy Spirit, I pray tonight

763
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,720
 that you would kindle a new flame

764
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,720
 in the heart of every person

765
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,720
 that is longing for something more.

766
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,720
 And I ask you to do that in the name that is power,

767
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,720
 the name that made the way.

768
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
 Lord, we don't want any striving

769
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
 and we're not into any striving tonight,

770
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,720
 but we do know that we're not just magically

771
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 gonna get up the mountain.

772
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:08,720
 And so will you ignite a determination to press through,

773
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,720
 a determination to not settle,

774
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
 a determination to not give up,

775
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,720
 a determination that says, "I'm gonna keep coming.

776
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 "Feelings or no feelings, I'm gonna keep coming

777
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:27,720
 "until I see something that literally blows me away

778
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,720
 "and changes everything."

779
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,720
 Lord, I ask that, that you would give a brand new heart.

780
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,720
 The heart of Joshua

781
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,720
 would be in these sons and daughters tonight.

782
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
 I'm not leaving the tent.

783
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,720
 I'm not leaving the tent.

784
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
 I'm not rushing away.

785
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
 I'm not in a hurry.

786
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,720
 And I'm not buying the lie that I'm not wanted.

787
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,720
 I'm staying with you.

788
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,720
 Yeah, that's what we're asking for.

789
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
 In Jesus' name.

790
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,720
 (gentle music)

791
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,300
 (gentle music)
