1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,440
 How are we?

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
 Oh man, okay.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,720
 Hey, let's thank these guys for leading us.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,400
 Fort Worth, I know you have Jared Rutzel.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,200
 Houston, I don't know who you're worshiping to,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,800
 but man, worship leaders just stir our affections for Jesus.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,440
 It's fun to come into this place

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,440
 and sing love songs to God wherever you're at.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,240
 If you're tuning in somewhere, streaming,

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,900
 we hope that you're worshiping with us,

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,840
 if not through song, as we open God's word.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,520
 And so I want you to turn to Judges 11.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
 If you have your Bible, if you don't have a Bible

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,480
 or own a Bible, we'll give you a Bible free this evening.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,640
 You can pull out your phones and turn there

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,120
 on your phones or device or whatever that looks like.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,120
 Judges 11, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,360
 Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, chapter 11.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,440
 I'm gonna open tonight with a crazy story.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,520
 We're gonna talk about Jephthah.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,560
 And so who can tell me some things about Jephthah?

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,960
 Okay, not a lot of hands, okay?

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,440
 I didn't see one actually.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,000
 And so this story that I'm about to tell you,

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,720
 you may have never heard it preached in your entire life.

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,400
 You probably have never heard this story.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,320
 And I read it this week and I was just like,

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,480
 that's a crazy story, why is that in our Bibles?

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,440
 And so I just wanna turn there with you.

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,680
 And so let me set this up, Jephthah, he's a gang leader.

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,800
 Okay, true story.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,040
 He was, his dad was married and he had some brothers,

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
 but his dad slept with a prostitute.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,720
 The prostitute got pregnant and had Jephthah.

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
 And so he's this illegitimate child of this man

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,600
 and he goes into the home, the brothers kick him out,

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,320
 throw him on the streets, he goes on the streets,

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,800
 he starts gang banging.

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,880
 And so he's like a blood or a crip or something.

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,400
 And the Israelites, just to set the scene,

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,480
 God's people are under attack from other nations.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,160
 Specifically, there's this really powerful nation

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,400
 called the Ammonites.

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,040
 And they're after God's people, they're after God's land.

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,440
 And they're just getting their tails handed to them

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,960
 and they're like, what are we gonna do?

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,240
 You know what, we're gonna go after that bad,

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,000
 bad gang leader, Jephthah, who we threw out.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,960
 And let's see if he can lead us into victory.

51
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,600
 And so this has been going on.

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
 And so Jephthah kind of enters the scene.

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
 He's like, hey, but you guys rejected me.

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,440
 They're like, we know, but if you'll come

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,160
 and you'll lead us to fight this army, the Ammonites,

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,060
 you know, we'll take you back and you can be a part of us.

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,440
 And he's like, okay, maybe so.

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,200
 And so Jephthah kind of enters the picture

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,320
 and Jephthah reaches out to the Ammonite king

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,180
 and just says, hey, why do you wanna fight with us?

61
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,600
 And he says, well, because you took our land.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,720
 And he goes, no, we didn't.

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
 God gave us this land.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,160
 And by the way, that was 300 years ago.

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,500
 And why have you been silent for 300 years?

66
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,360
 And the guy basically says, shut up, it's my land,

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,520
 let's make war.

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
 That's the message version.

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
 And so here's where we're at.

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
 And I'm gonna start here in verse 29.

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,320
 Let me go, okay.

72
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
 So verse 29, chapter 11, verse 29.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
 "Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah.

74
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,540
 "He crossed Gilead and Manasseh,

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,560
 "passed through Mizpah of Gilead,

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,260
 "and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.

77
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,400
 "And Jephthah," listen, "made a vow to the Lord.

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
 "If you give the Ammonites into my hands,

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,840
 "whatever comes out of the door of my house

80
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,960
 "to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites

81
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,600
 "will be the Lord's, and I will sacrifice it

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,060
 "as a burnt offering."

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,460
 Anybody have a pet here, a puppy?

84
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,040
 Specifically a puppy.

85
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,240
 Cats are hardly pets.

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,600
 But if you have, anybody?

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,020
 Raise your hand high if you have a puppy.

88
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,320
 Okay, and so if you don't know what I'm talking about,

89
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,080
 find somebody with their hand up afterwards

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,900
 and you can ask them.

91
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,880
 When you guys go out of town, right,

92
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,260
 and then you come back, you've been gone for a week,

93
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,960
 maybe you sent the puppy to the kennel or to a friend,

94
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
 you come back, like, hey, you know,

95
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,800
 it's like, let's play, where have you been?

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
 Come on, I missed you, you know, right?

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,760
 Am I alone on this, right?

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,080
 That happens, if you raise your hand, just lie for me.

99
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,660
 Okay, and so he's saying, hey, when I come back to battle,

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,600
 I don't know if he had a bunch of chickens or goats

101
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,000
 or what was hanging out in his house,

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
 but he says, hey, whatever comes out,

103
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,480
 I'll sacrifice as a burnt offering

104
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,100
 if you'll give me victory.

105
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,960
 He makes that commitment to the Lord.

106
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,040
 Then Jephthah, verse 32, went over to fight the Ammonites

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,360
 and the Lord gave them into his hands.

108
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,440
 He wins, and it goes on to verse 33.

109
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,320
 It says he doesn't just win, he dominates them.

110
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,140
 He conquers the land around them.

111
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,200
 Verse 34, when Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah,

112
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,400
 who should come out to meet him but his daughter,

113
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,280
 dancing to the sound of timbrels?

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,640
 She was an only child.

115
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,600
 Except for her, he had neither son nor daughter.

116
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,980
 And when he saw her, he tore his clothes and he cried,

117
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,360
 oh no, my daughter, you have brought me down

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
 and I am devastated.

119
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,400
 I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.

120
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,440
 This is crazy.

121
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,040
 He says, hey God, whatever comes out to greet me

122
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,480
 when I get home, I will offer as a burnt sacrifice to you.

123
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,080
 He comes home and it's his only child,

124
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,500
 his only daughter comes out to him.

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,560
 And if you think that's crazy, it just gets crazier.

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,200
 How she responds, 'cause I'd be like, oh no, psych.

127
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,920
 My father, she replied,

128
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,120
 you have given your word to the Lord.

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
 Do to me as you promised.

130
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,440
 Now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies,

131
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,700
 the Ammonites, but grant me this one request, she said,

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,960
 give me two months to roam the hills and weep

133
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,180
 with my friends because I will never marry.

134
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,400
 Now some of you girls are like, that just makes sense.

135
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,440
 You know, she'd be sad.

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,780
 (congregation laughing)

137
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,720
 He may go, you may go, he said.

138
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
 And he let her go for two months.

139
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,960
 She and her friends went into the hills and wept

140
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,240
 because she would never marry.

141
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,000
 After the two months, she returned to her father

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 and he did to her as he had vowed, and she was a virgin,

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
 which is a weird thing to add.

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
 (congregation laughing)

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
 Some commentaries believe that she was just then

146
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,000
 given to celibacy.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,880
 Others would say, no, he offered her as a burnt offering.

148
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,320
 The sad thing tonight is you guys are probably wrestling

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,200
 with what's worse, you know, with celibacy

150
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,440
 or the burnt offering, I don't know.

151
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,000
 And so I wanna tell you where I stand.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,540
 I think he did as he promised.

153
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,760
 And when you read that, and I'm not saying it was right,

154
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,800
 and I'm not condoning the decision,

155
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,540
 I'm just saying it happened, okay?

156
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,960
 So listen, I'm not, you know, the application not is like,

157
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,600
 hey, offer a burnt offering to the Lord, no.

158
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,360
 But why, when I read that, I'm like,

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,720
 why did he go through with it?

160
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
 I think when you read it, if you were honest,

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
 like the first thing you think is like, no, no, no, no, no.

162
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,080
 Tell God, like God will like change your mind.

163
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,840
 Why did he go through with this?

164
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,760
 But I want you to understand something.

165
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,740
 And the reason I tell you this crazy story this evening

166
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,080
 is because in the ancient world,

167
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
 they would not have asked why did he go through with it?

168
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
 They would have asked, why did he make the vow?

169
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,400
 We know why he went through with it,

170
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,440
 because you keep your word.

171
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,400
 The culture, listen closely,

172
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,960
 the culture of which the Bible was written into

173
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
 was a culture where your word mattered more than anything.

174
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,640
 You did what you said you were going to do.

175
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,460
 And so while we read it and we're like,

176
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,800
 why did he go through with it?

177
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
 They read it and they're like,

178
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,440
 man, he shouldn't have made that promise.

179
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,280
 That was dumb.

180
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,980
 But we know why he went through with it, assuming he did.

181
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,940
 Because in this culture, you keep your word.

182
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,880
 That's the culture that the Bible is written into.

183
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,760
 And Jephthah knew the scriptures.

184
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,120
 He knew the Torah.

185
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,480
 He knew the law and he understood that God really cares

186
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,160
 about people keeping their commitments.

187
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
 Now he had a messed up view of it

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,320
 and he needed some accountability

189
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,580
 and some community to come in and say,

190
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,600
 hey, God's got a grace and here's the deal.

191
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,880
 He probably doesn't want you to kill your daughter.

192
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,720
 And by the way, that's against the law in and of itself.

193
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,240
 But that's a sermon for another time.

194
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,180
 And so the reason I say that is so that you have

195
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,320
 a great understanding of the culture

196
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,280
 of which the Bible is written into,

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,540
 because we don't err to that side.

198
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,440
 We're not like keeping crazy promises.

199
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,680
 Like we don't even keep really basic ones.

200
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
 In fact, not only do we not keep them,

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,280
 we don't even wanna make them.

202
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,880
 Like we struggle just to make commitments.

203
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,840
 Like some of you guys, I'll just pick on you for a moment,

204
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
 probably all evening.

205
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,320
 Some of you guys, it's like, you know, as I said before,

206
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,160
 you've been dating a girl for a long, long time, like years.

207
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
 You're like, I don't know, man, I can't take that step.

208
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
 And then others of you are like, yeah,

209
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,100
 like engagements off the table,

210
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,920
 you can't even ask a girl out.

211
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,580
 Like that's too much of a commitment for you,

212
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,120
 amen, ladies?

213
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
 Okay.

214
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,480
 Okay, and now guys, before you walk out, okay,

215
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 I see you already like planning your exit.

216
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,360
 Before you do, let me just say, man, I was the same way.

217
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,320
 I was absolutely the same way.

218
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,960
 I was dating this girl that was graduating from Baylor,

219
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,800
 and I needed to get her a graduation gift,

220
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
 and I was like, oh man, I'll get an engagement ring.

221
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
 Like that'll go well, like she'll love that, you know?

222
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,300
 And then, and then to make matters worse,

223
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,020
 I got her a set of golf clubs

224
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,700
 just in case I changed my mind.

225
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,780
 So I travel, true story, I travel to Baylor,

226
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,220
 I travel to Waco with an engagement ring

227
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,940
 and a set of women's golf clubs in the back.

228
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,980
 And I get there and she walks across the stage,

229
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,060
 and you know what's crazy, you know what happened?

230
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
 I changed my mind.

231
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,860
 It's like, here's some golf clubs, I hope you like 'em.

232
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,780
 And we'll go golfing together, it's gonna be great.

233
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,900
 And so I changed my mind.

234
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,100
 So you know what I did, I sold the wedding ring.

235
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,260
 I came back to Dallas, I worked with this guy,

236
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,100
 he was looking for an engagement ring,

237
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,140
 he's like, oh man, God's providence, I have one here.

238
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,460
 And I sell it to him, okay?

239
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,220
 He calls off the engagement, 'cause he's flaky too,

240
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,620
 and then I buy the wedding ring back.

241
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,720
 And then I just carry it in my pocket,

242
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,620
 just looking for the right time.

243
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,500
 Just like a flippant decision, like I don't know,

244
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,900
 like maybe today's the day, on a date at Dairy Queen.

245
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,100
 No, probably not.

246
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,900
 But one day, one day we're on a date,

247
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,500
 we're on a date at dinner, and it had gone well,

248
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,020
 it was a good conversation.

249
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,100
 I was like, hmm, okay.

250
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,500
 I go, I grab the ring, I come back, I give it to the waiter,

251
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,180
 I'm like, bring it out for dessert.

252
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,140
 He does, I get on a knee, I'm like, will you marry me?

253
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,980
 She's like, yes.

254
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,860
 It looked to her like it was this grand, you know,

255
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,540
 planned proposal.

256
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,420
 It was a decision I had made about 37 seconds earlier.

257
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,980
 (congregation laughing)

258
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,420
 And when I tell people that,

259
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,180
 they usually respond the same way.

260
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,820
 Poor Monica.

261
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,500
 (congregation laughing)

262
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,340
 Because I wasn't a man of commitment.

263
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,980
 Like I was flaky and flippant,

264
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,900
 and kind of following the Spirit,

265
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,340
 and God, where's the open door, and speak to me,

266
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,180
 and let me walk through that.

267
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,500
 And it just kind of marked my life, this flippancy,

268
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 and honestly, I had carried that into the marriage,

269
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,260
 because as I stood there, like honestly, I thought,

270
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,180
 hey, we'll be engaged for like four years.

271
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
 Her dad had other plans,

272
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,580
 and so we get married four months later,

273
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,060
 and, yeah, wow.

274
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,820
 And I just thought, like here's honestly

275
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,620
 what's going through my mind.

276
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,980
 I just thought, yeah, man, we'll do that.

277
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,220
 We'll give that a shot.

278
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,900
 If it doesn't, you know, divorce, be a statistic.

279
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,340
 I mean, most people are, and it's okay.

280
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,180
 It's okay, this just marked kind of the,

281
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,500
 in the back of my mind, I thought,

282
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,580
 hey, we'll give this a shot,

283
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,860
 and if it doesn't work, we'll undo this.

284
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,140
 I didn't have the conviction of Jethro.

285
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,180
 I wasn't like, no, no, whatever I say,

286
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,540
 like I'm gonna do that.

287
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,740
 And we are so submersed in this culture.

288
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,500
 Like some of you, if you were honest,

289
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,260
 that's the way that you view commitments,

290
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,060
 which is a covenant like marriage,

291
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,420
 and not just marriage, but other commitments that you make.

292
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,380
 Think it's not a big deal.

293
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,140
 Like if something comes up, my friends will understand.

294
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,220
 And that is inconsistent with being a follower of Christ.

295
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,940
 Like spontaneity is cute,

296
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,300
 but so are pigtails and babies and things like that,

297
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,300
 and they're not consistent with mature adulting, if you will.

298
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,420
 And so we're in this series, Adulting.

299
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,380
 We're talking about what it looks like to grow up.

300
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,620
 Welcome to the real world.

301
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,020
 And tonight, we're talking about keeping commitments.

302
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,820
 Keeping commitments.

303
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,580
 And so we're gonna dive right in from there.

304
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:42,420
 This is usually where I give you some stats

305
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,180
 and just kinda tell you about how awful we are at this.

306
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,900
 I was looking at the stats, I got too depressed,

307
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
 and so I'll just summarize them for you.

308
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,140
 We don't commit to marriage.

309
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,420
 That is, we don't propose, and then when we do, we end it.

310
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,500
 We don't commit to work.

311
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,820
 We don't commit to church,

312
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
 and we don't commit to following Christ.

313
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,280
 More than any other generation

314
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,900
 that has ever walked the planet, we are the least committal.

315
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,220
 Higher divorce rates, lower engagements rates.

316
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,100
 We change jobs like underwear.

317
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,180
 This is the things that mark us, okay?

318
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,980
 And I'm not trying to beat you up,

319
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,700
 but tonight, before you leave,

320
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,580
 I want you to have a biblical understanding

321
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,860
 of what God desires for you as it relates to commitment

322
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,620
 because he really, really, really cares.

323
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,980
 It's really important.

324
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,500
 And so let's just start this evening

325
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,060
 by talking about why don't we keep commitments as adults.

326
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,340
 We'll just ask that question.

327
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,780
 Why don't we keep commitments?

328
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,620
 What are the reasons that we don't keep commitments?

329
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,980
 And the first one that I'll cover

330
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,700
 is I think because we're overcommitted.

331
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,860
 We've filled our lives with things that don't matter.

332
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,980
 Let me say it in a different way.

333
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,300
 We've filled our lives

334
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,780
 with things of no eternal significance

335
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,660
 so that when something of eternal significance,

336
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,820
 something that exists within our purpose of existence

337
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,740
 comes along, we're too busy for it.

338
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,380
 We are overprogrammed.

339
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,420
 We are too committed to the same routines of sin,

340
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,340
 the same routines and patterns of going out

341
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,460
 and coming in and conversing

342
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,580
 that we're stuck in this cycle

343
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,700
 that is robbing us of creativity

344
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,540
 and robbing us of real joy

345
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,740
 and robbing our lives of real meaning

346
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,120
 so that when something that God calls us to comes along,

347
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,720
 we just don't have time for it.

348
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,380
 It doesn't sound interesting

349
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,700
 compared to all of the other things.

350
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,580
 Ephesians chapter five, verses 15 and 17 says,

351
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,540
 "Be careful then how you live,

352
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,940
 "not as unwise but as wise,

353
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,100
 "making the most of every opportunity,

354
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,820
 "seizing the right opportunities

355
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,280
 "because the days are evil.

356
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,660
 "Therefore, do not be foolish

357
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,760
 "but understand what the Lord's will is.

358
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,020
 "Commit to the things that are within the Lord's will.

359
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,380
 "Do not, do not weigh your life down

360
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,140
 "with things and patterns and cycles

361
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,840
 "that are not within the Lord's will,

362
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,360
 "robbing yourself of creativity,

363
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,780
 "doing the same thing over and over and over

364
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,460
 "and thinking that it's life."

365
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,860
 The second reason I think that we don't keep commitments

366
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
 is because better options come along,

367
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,380
 because better options come along.

368
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,100
 You've probably heard of #FOMO,

369
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
 which is just the fear of missing out.

370
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,140
 It actually started as FOBO,

371
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,780
 or the fear of a better option,

372
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,540
 and slowly became FOMO.

373
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,540
 And so here's the deal is we kinda go through life

374
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,260
 wondering and being afraid of what we're gonna miss out on,

375
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,420
 and I just wanna free you from that.

376
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,640
 Like, hear me on this.

377
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,080
 Like, if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

378
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,740
 you get heaven, you miss out on nothing.

379
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,000
 Your life is short but of vapor, the word says.

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,980
 And 200 years from now, no one's like,

381
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,540
 oh, but I never saw the Grand Canyon.

382
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,220
 You know, it's like, God's like,

383
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,980
 oh, you wanna see the Grand, here, the Grand, you know.

384
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,020
 That just doesn't happen.

385
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,180
 No one's like, oh, but I never got married.

386
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,780
 I never experienced sex.

387
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,420
 Nobody's saying that in heaven, okay?

388
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,220
 Nobody's like, yeah, but that one time,

389
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,200
 you know, I didn't get to go see the better movie

390
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,860
 'cause I'd committed to the lesser better movie

391
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,500
 with the other friend, and the friend that I really,

392
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,060
 and nobody's saying that.

393
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,260
 It's silly, and it's robbing you of life.

394
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,300
 And so do what is the most loving to others.

395
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,460
 Make commitments and keep them regardless.

396
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,780
 Period.

397
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,740
 Something comes along, check your calendar.

398
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,380
 If you can do it, and if it will be loving,

399
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,300
 say, I will do it.

400
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,380
 Not yes, maybe, probably, might, possibly.

401
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,740
 I'm in.

402
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,620
 I give you my word.

403
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,180
 I'll keep my commitment even if it hurts.

404
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,420
 I'm gonna give you two scriptures.

405
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,020
 Philippians 2, verse three says,

406
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,620
 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vacancy,

407
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,140
 rather, in humility, value others above yourselves.

408
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,340
 There is no FOMO in that.

409
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,460
 Value others better than yourselves.

410
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,060
 If we just did that, imagine how much

411
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,080
 of a better place our world would be.

412
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,220
 If you went to work tomorrow, and you just began to think,

413
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,620
 hey, I'm gonna stop thinking about myself,

414
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,740
 and I'm gonna start thinking about others,

415
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,260
 and I'm gonna do whatever, in any given situation,

416
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,620
 whatever's the most loving.

417
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,180
 Not what is selfish.

418
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,540
 And then let me give you one that I love

419
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,460
 in talking about this.

420
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,380
 It's Psalm 15.

421
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,980
 It's Psalm 15, and it just starts out,

422
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,860
 Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent?

423
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,340
 Who may live on your holy mountain?

424
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,580
 That's how the Psalm starts,

425
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,020
 and it answers the question in verse four.

426
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,940
 It says, the one who keeps an oath,

427
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,740
 even when it hurts, and does not change their mind.

428
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,140
 Who can be with you, God, forever and ever,

429
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,220
 in your kingdom?

430
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,400
 The one who keeps an oath.

431
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,220
 The one who keeps a commitment, even when it hurts,

432
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,660
 and does not change their mind.

433
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,460
 There's no FOMO in that.

434
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,060
 There's no, but yeah, but my friend Kathy came along

435
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,420
 with a better movie, and it was a better option.

436
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,640
 It was a better dance, better date.

437
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,440
 There's none of that in that verse.

438
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,620
 The third reason I think that we don't keep commitments

439
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,280
 is we don't value our word.

440
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,420
 There's no value in what we say.

441
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,360
 We say silly things when we don't mean it.

442
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,900
 You know, it was, I heard a guy on the radio the other day

443
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,100
 say, he was talking about Denzel Washington,

444
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,180
 and he said, he literally set the screen on fire.

445
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,140
 I'm like, no he didn't.

446
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,340
 You can't say literally, and then say whatever you want.

447
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,800
 Like, that word means something.

448
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,820
 And we do that.

449
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,020
 We're like, I promise, it was the best meal I had ever had.

450
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,180
 Really, I mean, really?

451
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,380
 Like, you promise?

452
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,380
 Like, to be honest with you, oh, here comes a lie.

453
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,820
 Right, I mean, we say these things,

454
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,460
 they're just kinda tag-ons.

455
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 I love the way the Lord just provides illustrations.

456
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,740
 I came home for dinner last night,

457
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,140
 and I had walked in, and my daughter Finley, she's six,

458
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,940
 she's so upset about something, I don't know what.

459
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,060
 And she just goes, Daddy, Kyle lied to me.

460
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,380
 Daddy, Kyle lied to me.

461
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,220
 Kyle lied to me.

462
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,380
 And I was like, getting a meal.

463
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,140
 I wasn't ignoring her on purpose,

464
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,060
 but I could tell something was building up,

465
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,940
 and so I kinda made my plate, and I sat down,

466
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,020
 and she goes, Daddy, Kyle lied to me.

467
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,140
 This time, tears welling up in her eyes,

468
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,100
 and I said, Finley bear, what, what, what happened?

469
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,460
 And she just said, Daddy, Kyle said

470
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,620
 that he would play with me on Friday.

471
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,820
 He said on Monday that he would play with me,

472
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,020
 and he didn't.

473
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,420
 I said, oh, baby girl, I'm sorry, what did he do?

474
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,900
 He played gaga ball.

475
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,140
 I'm like, well, have you ever played gaga ball?

476
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,580
 I mean, it's pretty fun, no, I didn't say that.

477
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,340
 I go, I said, oh, baby girl, I'm sorry,

478
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,940
 and then I go, how did that make you feel?

479
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,380
 Because when you don't know what to say,

480
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,020
 and you're talking to a girl who's emotional,

481
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,380
 just say that, it will help you.

482
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,420
 Guys, that's free.

483
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,040
 Gentlemen, that's free, okay?

484
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,580
 That's gonna serve you well in the future.

485
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,780
 Just look 'em in the eyes and go, oh, I'm so sorry.

486
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,220
 How did that make you feel?

487
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,020
 And she said, and she goes, not good.

488
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,420
 And I was like, I needed a longer answer.

489
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,820
 I'm still thinking, you know?

490
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,220
 And she says, not good, and I said, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

491
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,700
 I said, sometimes guys do that.

492
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,540
 Sometimes people do that.

493
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,580
 Sometimes they say things that they don't mean,

494
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,140
 and I said, you know what, and this is what I want you

495
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,900
 to learn from my six-year-old.

496
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,820
 I just said, you're right in saying that he's a liar.

497
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,340
 That's what he did, he lied to you.

498
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,980
 When you say you're gonna do something and you don't do it,

499
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,900
 that is a lie indeed.

500
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,140
 And she said, well, Kelly did say that he had a crush on me.

501
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,900
 And I said, I will crush him, Finley.

502
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,780
 (congregation laughing)

503
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,420
 I said, what is a crush?

504
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,260
 What does that even mean?

505
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,780
 She goes, I don't know, I think it means that he likes me.

506
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,340
 And I said, Finley, here's the deal.

507
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,220
 We're not even gonna have that conversation

508
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,740
 for about 20 years, okay?

509
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,940
 But here's the deal.

510
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,620
 When we do have it, I want you to learn something

511
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,180
 from this experience, all right?

512
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,340
 If a guy does not keep his commitment,

513
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,660
 then he's not someone that you're interested in.

514
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,420
 If breaking commitments marks his life,

515
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,980
 then that's something that you don't wanna

516
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,700
 go through life with.

517
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,540
 And so don't look at how he treats you

518
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
 because if he's trying to impress you,

519
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,620
 he may treat you well.

520
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,820
 In this situation, he didn't.

521
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,060
 But if he's trying to, right,

522
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,740
 he's trying to impress you, he may treat you well.

523
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,060
 Look at how he treats the commitments of others

524
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,620
 because one day, that emotional rush is gonna leave

525
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,940
 and that's how he's gonna treat you

526
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,780
 and that's how he's gonna treat marriage.

527
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,340
 And the same thing goes for ladies.

528
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,420
 I'm not just picking on the guys.

529
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
 Ladies, same thing for you.

530
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,820
 If she's flighty and flaky and noncommittal

531
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,200
 and she's in and out and she's whimsical,

532
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,380
 constantly trying to discern what the Lord's will is

533
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,260
 and chasing it like a tail,

534
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,260
 not that she has a tail, but that's weird,

535
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,740
 be careful.

536
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,820
 Be cautious.

537
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:14,940
 It really matters to God.

538
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,540
 I'm gonna share some verses with you

539
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,800
 just to make this point.

540
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:23,500
 In Numbers 30, and so here's what's going on

541
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,140
 is the Israelites have been wandering

542
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,260
 through the desert for 40 years.

543
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,640
 This would have been a verse that Jephthah knew

544
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,140
 and probably drove his actions.

545
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,300
 And so in Numbers 30, the Israelites have been

546
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,780
 roaming the desert for 40 years

547
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,720
 and Moses thinks he's about to take them

548
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,080
 into the promised land, but he's not.

549
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,420
 And so God says, what happens in 40 years

550
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,100
 is the generation turns.

551
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,540
 And so those who knew the law of the Lord

552
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,920
 were no longer there and there's been this uprising,

553
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,380
 this Gen Y, or these millennials, if you will,

554
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,340
 and they didn't know what was important to God.

555
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,980
 And so God just says, hey, before they go

556
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,580
 in the promised land, you've gotta tell them

557
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,060
 what is most important to me.

558
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,660
 And so he walks Moses through the laws

559
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,620
 of the Old Testament.

560
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,260
 He walks Moses through the ceremonies that matter to God.

561
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,980
 And then he says, hey, this is what is most important to me.

562
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,740
 You must tell them this thing right here

563
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,700
 in his Numbers 30, verses one and two.

564
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,420
 Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel,

565
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,180
 this is what the Lord commands.

566
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,460
 When a man makes a vow to the Lord

567
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,260
 or takes an oath to obligate himself by pledge,

568
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,380
 he must not break his word, but must do everything

569
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,100
 that he said he was going to do.

570
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,420
 This is what matters to God.

571
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,300
 Before you go into the promised land,

572
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,900
 you need to know what matters most to God

573
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,640
 is that a man does what he says he's going to do.

574
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,420
 That's my second point this evening

575
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,820
 is why we must keep commitments if we're Christians.

576
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,300
 If you're not a Christian here in your flaky,

577
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,220
 we understand, but if you're a follower of Christ,

578
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,660
 why we must keep commitments.

579
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,500
 Because God who set the world into motion

580
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,120
 knows that nearly anything great that happens

581
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,460
 comes out of a commitment.

582
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,920
 No one has a beautiful faith without a commitment.

583
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,460
 No one knows the word of God well without a commitment.

584
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,540
 This is what I'm saying.

585
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,260
 There is no Super Bowl ring without an intense commitment.

586
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,580
 There is no NBA championship without an intense commitment.

587
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,500
 Everything that you think of great in the world,

588
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,620
 every CEO, every incredible artist,

589
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,700
 everybody who is incredibly skilled

590
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,700
 is something that comes through an intense commitment

591
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,580
 and likewise a relationship with God.

592
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,480
 God made the world that way.

593
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,340
 And he says commitment really matters.

594
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,860
 Keeping your commitments really, really matter,

595
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,660
 not just following your emotions.

596
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,800
 And so Christians, friends, listen,

597
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:59,340
 Christians should be the forerunners of great things.

598
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,720
 Like we should be the most innovative, most creative,

599
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,260
 most manufacturer of beautiful things in the world.

600
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,380
 The best artists, the best engineers, the best scientists,

601
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,940
 the best teachers should be followers of Christ.

602
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,820
 But we haven't preserved this idea

603
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,660
 in fact we're just as flaky as pagans.

604
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,180
 And we say we're Christ followers,

605
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,020
 but we're not.

606
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,420
 We're not committed to much except for the things

607
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,940
 that we really, really, really, really want.

608
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,620
 And so I tell you this guys,

609
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,340
 because in this series what I wanna do

610
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,700
 is I wanna give you what's called a biblical worldview.

611
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,260
 And that's a buzzword you're gonna hear

612
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,780
 if you hang out in church much,

613
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,260
 a biblical worldview, this is what's important.

614
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,100
 And a biblical worldview just means

615
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,940
 it's the way that you see the world,

616
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,140
 it's the lens of which you see the world through,

617
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,120
 that you would see it through God's word

618
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,060
 as he intended the world to be.

619
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,780
 Not through your experience and not through the culture

620
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,140
 that has educated you,

621
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,740
 but that you would see it through a biblical worldview.

622
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,520
 Let me just give you some examples to hit this home.

623
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,900
 People will say, well I don't wanna be married.

624
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,900
 I say, hey that's interesting.

625
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,540
 That's good that you have identified your desires.

626
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,640
 Do you know what God wants for you?

627
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,940
 Are you following your emotions and your feelings?

628
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,980
 Or have you searched the word of God and said,

629
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,460
 hey God, what do you want for me?

630
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,820
 People come and say, hey I don't wanna have children.

631
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,620
 Just not really into it.

632
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,940
 Okay, great, we've identified your preference.

633
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,060
 Now do you know what God desires for you?

634
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,640
 Do you know how God views children?

635
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,740
 Do you view children like God does?

636
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,500
 Or has your preference and your desires

637
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,260
 and your feelings trumped everything else?

638
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,820
 Because that's what culture teaches.

639
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,380
 I'll give you some others.

640
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,280
 They'll say, well I believe divorce is an option.

641
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,180
 Interesting.

642
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,780
 Do you know what God believes?

643
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,020
 Do you know what God says about it?

644
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,740
 Do you get to determine what is real?

645
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,340
 Or does God determine what is real?

646
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,300
 And in what situation and what does his word teach?

647
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,020
 They'll say things like,

648
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,820
 well I think I should take a job if it means more money.

649
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,940
 Okay, that is definitely the logic of our culture.

650
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,780
 What does God think?

651
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,020
 Go back and listen to last week.

652
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,400
 What does God desire for you?

653
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,740
 I want you to have a biblical worldview.

654
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,100
 Our opinions are shaped most by culture and experience.

655
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
 But listen to what God's word says.

656
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,980
 And let me tell you what it says specifically

657
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,860
 in regards to this topic, Ecclesiastes chapter five,

658
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,240
 verses five and six.

659
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,800
 It is better to not vow than to make a vow

660
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,920
 and not fulfill it.

661
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,500
 It is better to not or not to vow

662
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,160
 than to make a vow and not fulfill it.

663
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,740
 Do not let your mouth lead you into sin.

664
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,980
 To make a commitment and not to fulfill

665
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,760
 that commitment is sin, he says.

666
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,340
 This is a biblical worldview.

667
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,180
 This redefines some things for you.

668
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,460
 This is what the scripture says.

669
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,020
 And I want you to tell you why,

670
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,060
 I wanna tell you why that verse is so familiar to me.

671
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,700
 Anybody know why it's so familiar to me?

672
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,240
 If you do, you don't have a microphone.

673
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,440
 So let me just tell you.

674
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,840
 I say it at every single wedding I do.

675
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,380
 I say it very often.

676
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,620
 I look at the couple and in front of all

677
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,380
 of their friends and family.

678
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,220
 I just say, hey, do you know that the scripture says

679
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,980
 to not be hasty in regards to these sorts of things?

680
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
 He says it's better not to make a vow.

681
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,440
 In a minute, you're gonna say these things we call vows.

682
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,540
 He just says it's better not to make one

683
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,100
 than to make one and not fulfill it.

684
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
 So this would be a great out.

685
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,980
 And when Monica and I are meeting with a couple,

686
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,100
 I just say, hey, is there any reason that you would end this

687
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,260
 and to which they always say,

688
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,740
 I mean, we've done this dozens of times.

689
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,420
 They always say, no, never, I love him, he's great.

690
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,020
 And then I'm usually the jerk that just says, okay, cool.

691
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,420
 Hey, if he cheated on you with your best friend,

692
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,460
 we still good?

693
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,700
 You still in?

694
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
 Well, he would never do that.

695
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,500
 I know he wouldn't, but if he did.

696
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,300
 [congregation laughing]

697
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,500
 And to him, I just look at him,

698
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,340
 if she cheated on you with your brother,

699
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,580
 I know that's an awful thought,

700
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,900
 but I want you to go there for a minute.

701
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,980
 You might get sick to your stomach,

702
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,140
 but I want you to go there because I wanna know

703
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,020
 what you would choose.

704
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,580
 If she cheated on you with your brother, are you still in?

705
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,940
 Because if not, let's just write that in the vows,

706
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,460
 richer or poorer, till death do us part,

707
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,060
 in sickness and in health,

708
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,820
 unless he cheats on me with my brother.

709
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,300
 You know, we'll just make that a part of it

710
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,100
 'cause we're about to say some crazy things

711
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,840
 as God is your witness.

712
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,060
 And so let's just say what we mean.

713
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,900
 Let's just say what we believe to be true

714
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,040
 in front of everyone, because as we steward the gospel,

715
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,460
 let me ask you something.

716
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,540
 Who is going to believe you when you say

717
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,260
 a man lived and he died and he came back to life,

718
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,340
 when you can't even keep a movie date, you know?

719
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,260
 It's like, no, I'm not, what are you talking about?

720
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,100
 You lie all the time.

721
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,820
 Why would I believe you about Jesus?

722
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,240
 You see why it matters?

723
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,020
 You hinder the gospel when you're flaky

724
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,360
 and flighty and flippant and noncommittal.

725
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,540
 And so it really matters to God.

726
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,900
 I'll say this real quickly.

727
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,080
 We keep commitments when we want to.

728
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,840
 And I just have a front row seat of this.

729
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,120
 And I see it all the time in specifically

730
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,280
 what I shared with you up front,

731
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,120
 like in regards to engagement rings.

732
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,120
 Like, you know, I meet dudes that are like broke,

733
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,300
 like no money, and they've never had a plan

734
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,340
 for proposals or anything like that.

735
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,060
 But they meet her, and they're like,

736
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,200
 all right, I gotta get an engagement ring.

737
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,600
 And so they do what I did.

738
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,140
 They go online and they begin to learn DEF,

739
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,180
 color, cut, clarity, caret, you know,

740
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,780
 and VS1, SI1, they become experts on diamonds.

741
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,220
 And then at some point, they begin to look

742
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
 and see how much they are.

743
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,220
 And they begin to hyperventilate.

744
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,540
 And they're like, oh my goodness, oh my goodness, okay,

745
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,500
 how am I gonna do this?

746
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,660
 'Cause I've never saved a dime in my life.

747
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,420
 But all of a sudden, like in two weeks,

748
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,620
 they have thousands of dollars.

749
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,560
 Like they sold all of their things,

750
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,140
 they pawned their stuff, they sold plasma.

751
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,060
 And they're like, I'm ready.

752
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,980
 Like, I'm ready to make this commitment, okay?

753
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,260
 Like somehow, like magically.

754
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,380
 Because when we really, really want something,

755
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,540
 we become motivated and we do it,

756
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,860
 but we're led by selfishness.

757
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,540
 And I just wanna tell you, that doesn't go well.

758
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,620
 Those are really emotional decisions

759
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,500
 that lack plans and commitments.

760
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,020
 And it doesn't go well, because that same passion

761
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,340
 that led you into that decision

762
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,000
 is gonna be the same passion that leads 52% of people

763
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
 out of that decision.

764
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,140
 And there's this other big percentage of people

765
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,140
 that remain in that decision miserably,

766
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,780
 but they just don't respect it.

767
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,700
 They don't respect the covenant they made.

768
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,820
 And I don't want that for you.

769
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,800
 And so if you wonder why I say crazy things

770
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,540
 and maybe hurt your feelings, it's because I love you.

771
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,300
 I care about you, and I don't want that for you.

772
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,100
 I want something better for you.

773
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,340
 I want something more amazing for you.

774
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,080
 And so you're like, okay, well, so far, JP,

775
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,900
 you've given us some obscure Old Testament passages.

776
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,100
 You've told us about Jephthah.

777
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,660
 You've told us about Moses.

778
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,300
 Is this really something important to Jesus?

779
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,740
 And in Matthew chapter five,

780
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,240
 Jesus has one shot at the greatest sermon ever given.

781
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,300
 It's the Sermon on the Mount.

782
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,380
 And so he's gonna cover what's most important

783
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,420
 to the kingdom of God.

784
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,140
 And he says this in verse 33.

785
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,740
 "Again, you have heard that it was said

786
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,220
 "to the people long ago, do not break your oath,

787
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,080
 "but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord."

788
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,740
 By the way, that's Moses who said that.

789
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,880
 He's referencing Numbers chapter 30 right here.

790
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,660
 And he goes on to say that when you make an oath,

791
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,960
 if you're a follower of mine, just say yes and just say no.

792
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,500
 You don't need to say, I promise, I really, literally,

793
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,300
 I absolutely, I guarantee you, I will.

794
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,020
 Just say yes, I will do it.

795
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,560
 And if you're a follower of mine,

796
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,840
 people know that yes is as good, as gold, as solid, as oak.

797
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,340
 It's unbreakable, unshakable, permanent,

798
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,480
 because you're mine.

799
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,860
 So just look them in the eyes and say yes, I'll be there.

800
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,260
 Or no, I can't.

801
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,920
 But when you say yes, you keep that oath,

802
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,060
 even when it hurts.

803
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,200
 If you make a decision, honor it.

804
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,040
 My third and final point.

805
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,400
 What commitment should mark us?

806
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,360
 I'm gonna give you four things quickly.

807
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,580
 What commitments should mark us?

808
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,900
 The first one and most important one

809
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,820
 is a commitment to follow Christ.

810
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:42,720
 Like you only know this diluted, Americanized Christianity

811
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,900
 that I don't think is biblical Christianity,

812
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,100
 speaking of biblical worldview.

813
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,580
 But it's all you know.

814
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,060
 And so don't compare yourself to that.

815
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,560
 Like 'cause all the time I talk to people,

816
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,840
 they're like, oh yeah, I believe in God.

817
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,800
 I just don't take my faith too serious.

818
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,040
 I'm like, well Jesus took it serious.

819
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
 And God takes your faith serious.

820
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,720
 And so let me just propose a question to you.

821
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,000
 What if, like I think so many of us

822
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
 are like lukewarm Christians.

823
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,220
 And so let me just ask this question.

824
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,920
 What if there's no such thing as a lukewarm Christian?

825
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,400
 Like what if that's not a Christian at all?

826
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,520
 You might be like, whoa, JP, you're questioning my salvation.

827
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,960
 No, I'm trying to get you to question your salvation.

828
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,620
 Not because I want to drive you towards some anxious place.

829
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,840
 But as you examine your life,

830
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,600
 I'm not talking about your words and something you said.

831
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,540
 I'm saying do you believe in Jesus?

832
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,360
 Do you believe that he died for your sins?

833
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,980
 Do you believe that he raised from the dead?

834
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,480
 Does that what you believe?

835
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,800
 And are people that you work with,

836
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,360
 they're like, I don't know if she's a Christian.

837
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,720
 I mean, I have no idea.

838
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,040
 Or are they like, absolutely, she's a Christ follower.

839
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,640
 She's following Jesus.

840
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,800
 In the way that she dates, she's following Jesus.

841
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,840
 In the things that she says, she's following Jesus.

842
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,680
 In the places she goes, she's following Jesus.

843
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
 In the way she spends her money, she's following Jesus.

844
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,520
 She is a Jesus follower.

845
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,560
 That is a committed follower of Christ right there.

846
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,320
 Like I don't know, maybe he's Muslim, maybe he's Buddhist.

847
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,000
 I don't know, maybe he's spiritual, but not religious.

848
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,200
 I don't know what he is.

849
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,760
 Are you all in?

850
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,440
 Committed to following Christ.

851
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,780
 Second thing, committed to God's people.

852
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,080
 Committed to God's people.

853
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,240
 The second thing we're committed to,

854
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,640
 this is a commitment that should mark us.

855
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,480
 Specifically, church, by the way of membership,

856
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,300
 that there's a church.

857
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,520
 I don't mean a church that you attend,

858
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,360
 but there's a church that you belong to,

859
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,060
 that the elders are in authority over you,

860
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,560
 that you go there, you're a contributor,

861
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,760
 that you're a part of this church.

862
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,000
 Can I tell you something, friends,

863
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
 and I want you to lean in, I want you to write it down,

864
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,920
 I want you to listen closely.

865
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,360
 Church was never meant to be a place you go to.

866
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,620
 Church is your identity.

867
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,960
 You're the body of Christ.

868
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,100
 It's who you are.

869
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,380
 There is nowhere in the Bible that it talks of church

870
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,840
 as a place that you go to.

871
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,680
 Church is the body, the hands and feet,

872
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,800
 the literal hands and feet of Jesus Christ.

873
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,160
 And so that you would be there, be accounted for,

874
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,000
 be a member there, that you would belong there.

875
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,780
 And so what's great about this

876
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,800
 is if you're a member of a church,

877
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,680
 I know half of you go to another church,

878
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,080
 I love that you're here, we exist to serve the city.

879
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,300
 But if you don't have a church home,

880
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,460
 this Sunday you can show up here,

881
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,000
 and we would love to talk to you

882
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,020
 about our membership class,

883
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,420
 which just happens to be this Sunday.

884
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,020
 I didn't even realize that when I wrote this message.

885
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,680
 It's this Sunday.

886
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,360
 You can go there and you can hear

887
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,900
 what it is like to belong to a church.

888
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,920
 And friends, can I just tell you,

889
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,480
 there's two kinds of people in the room.

890
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,280
 If you're a follower of Christ, if you're a Christian,

891
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,860
 I'm talking to Christians, if you're a Christian,

892
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,900
 you either belong to a church or you don't.

893
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,440
 If you don't, I'm asking you to change that this Sunday.

894
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,960
 It'll be the best Valentine's gift

895
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,640
 you could give yourself this Sunday.

896
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,320
 And the second thing is community.

897
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,520
 And so if you belong to a church of 1,000 plus people,

898
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,760
 that's not really your community, okay?

899
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,160
 That's where you worship corporately,

900
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,140
 it's where you sing, it's where you're fed

901
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,480
 from the scriptures.

902
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,340
 But beyond your preferences,

903
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,920
 there should be these group of people

904
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,160
 who come alongside you and celebrate the hurts of life,

905
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,040
 and I'm sorry, not celebrate the hurts of life,

906
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,040
 carry the burdens of life with you

907
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,280
 and celebrate the victories of life with you.

908
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,800
 They're folks that help you make rent when you can't.

909
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
 They're folks that visit you in the hospital,

910
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,840
 they're your pastors, and said otherwise,

911
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,720
 they're the people you visit in the hospital,

912
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,360
 they're the people whose rent you help pay.

913
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,820
 It's a group that you belong to,

914
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,360
 we call that community here.

915
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,120
 That should be a part of your life

916
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,800
 if you're a Christ follower.

917
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,520
 You should be committed to that.

918
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,000
 You should show up when you don't feel like it.

919
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,960
 Because it's important, Hebrews 10, 25 says,

920
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,720
 "Let us not forsake the gathering together

921
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,960
 "as some are in the habit of doing.

922
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,260
 "But all the more, let's continue to spur one another on,

923
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,000
 "encourage one another towards love and good deeds."

924
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,080
 Commitment to serve.

925
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,520
 Let's serve in the church.

926
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,500
 That's you using your gifts in the way

927
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,360
 and for the reason they were given to you.

928
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,420
 That's serving others, that's giving your life away.

929
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,040
 And lastly, any commitments we've made.

930
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,120
 These are commitments we should keep,

931
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,320
 commitments that mark us, commitments we've made.

932
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,160
 And so let me just wrap up with this

933
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,580
 and just say maybe, right, maybe you're like,

934
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,300
 but JP, certainly, like what if grandma comes to town

935
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,860
 and I just didn't know she was coming to town

936
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,180
 because I didn't get her email and she doesn't send emails

937
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,700
 and then I had made a commitment to go see a movie

938
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,820
 but now grandma's in town and I need to see my grandma.

939
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,860
 Let me, I'm gonna give you something

940
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,680
 that's gonna be a gift to you.

941
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,300
 Write it down, I want you to remember this.

942
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,740
 If all 4,000 folks that are tuned in right now

943
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,800
 would just do this one thing,

944
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,180
 it would make the world a better place.

945
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,220
 And so it's super practical,

946
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,420
 it's no more practical than this, you ready?

947
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,560
 Okay, when you give someone a commitment,

948
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
 you've given them a gift.

949
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,940
 You've given them a gift of your time,

950
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,340
 you've gone on your calendar and you said,

951
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,860
 hey, this chunk of time in the future, that belongs to you

952
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,020
 or at least I'm going to share that with you.

953
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,500
 I'm gonna help you move Friday at seven.

954
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,380
 I'm giving you the gift of my time in this commitment.

955
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,460
 And then lo and behold, grandma says, guess what,

956
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,980
 surprise, I'm coming in on Friday, can't wait to see you.

957
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,460
 I've got big plans, please clear your calendar.

958
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,540
 Oh no, I'm committed, what do I do?

959
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,020
 Here's what you don't do, you don't say,

960
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,460
 hey, I said that, I'm sorry, my grandma's coming into town.

961
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,380
 You don't do that.

962
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,300
 You go to them and as you would with any gift

963
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,600
 that you give somebody, you say, hey,

964
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,520
 I made a commitment to you

965
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,660
 that I would be there Friday at seven.

966
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,780
 I want to ask if I can have that commitment back.

967
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,700
 I gave you the gift of my time,

968
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,220
 would you please consider giving that gift back

969
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,940
 and you be very specific, not vague, not ambiguous.

970
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,020
 You say, my grandmother's coming to town.

971
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,500
 You say, hey, there's something that has come up

972
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,980
 that I view as more important than that time that I gave you

973
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,740
 and this is what that something is, that's loving,

974
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,380
 that's so caring.

975
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,780
 You're not what they're saying about you

976
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,340
 is flaky and vague and ambiguous and managing information,

977
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,200
 that's not loving, that's sinful.

978
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,980
 I gave you the gift of my time, may I have that gift back?

979
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,760
 I promise you, probably shouldn't,

980
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,500
 most of the time, most of the time,

981
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,580
 they're gonna say, absolutely.

982
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,060
 Thank you for the way that you just did that.

983
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,420
 You just modeled something for me.

984
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,060
 You just made your God more attractive.

985
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,060
 I mean, you're a Jesus follower

986
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,600
 and you just made following Jesus more attractive to me

987
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,860
 in the way that you did that, in the way that you asked me,

988
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,380
 the way that you were so clear and mature

989
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,660
 and adulting about it.

990
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,080
 (congregation laughing)

991
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,260
 And so I just encourage you, I admonish you even,

992
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,980
 don't be afraid of difficult commitments.

993
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,280
 Adulting means making and keeping them.

994
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,580
 Adulting means making difficult commitments

995
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:00,380
 and keeping them and so, in summary,

996
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,180
 we don't keep commitments because of those reasons,

997
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,240
 because we're over committed,

998
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,020
 because we're afraid that better options

999
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,480
 are going to come along and pick this up.

1000
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,900
 And we must keep our commitments

1001
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,300
 because it's so clear in God's word that it matters to him

1002
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,620
 and the commitments that mark us

1003
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,460
 are a commitment to follow Christ,

1004
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,620
 a commitment to God's people,

1005
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,900
 a commitment to serve and commitments that we've made.

1006
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,800
 And so I told Finley, I said, hey,

1007
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,220
 the good news is about this whole situation

1008
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,860
 when she's so upset that Kyle didn't keep his word

1009
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,460
 and he played gaga ball, I just said,

1010
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,980
 the good news is that's just inconsistent

1011
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,480
 with who Christ followers are.

1012
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,700
 And she said, how do you know?

1013
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,460
 And I said, because Finley, Christ followers follow Jesus

1014
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,500
 and don't you understand that Jesus, Finley,

1015
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,120
 Jesus kept his commitment even when it hurt.

1016
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,100
 Even when it hurt, he's there in the garden of Gethsemane,

1017
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,900
 he's like, God, let this cup pass from me,

1018
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,140
 but not my will, thy will.

1019
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,820
 God, I'm committed to these people, Jesus, friends,

1020
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,700
 Jesus is committed to you

1021
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,860
 more than you've ever been committed to anything.

1022
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,060
 He's committed to you so much so

1023
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,620
 that he took all of your sins on himself.

1024
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,420
 Out of an act of love for you,

1025
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,220
 you tortured, suffered publicly, humiliated,

1026
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,500
 asphyxiated, nailed to two pieces of wood publicly

1027
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,780
 for you, specifically you.

1028
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:29,460
 He kept his commitment, even when it hurt.

1029
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,540
 I read the story of Jephthah, I'm like, what?

1030
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,580
 He sacrificed his daughter?

1031
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,260
 Like that man's crazy.

1032
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,820
 Why would he do that?

1033
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,700
 Who would do that?

1034
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,740
 Who would sacrifice their only child?

1035
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,140
 That's crazy, why would he do that?

1036
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,180
 God did it.

1037
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,480
 God did it.

1038
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,420
 God sacrificed his only child, his only son.

1039
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,220
 He's committed to you to show you how committed to you.

1040
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,060
 He loves you more than a child.

1041
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:17,900
 He's pursuing you, radically chasing you into the world.

1042
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,700
 He knows what you're going through.

1043
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,540
 You think we don't understand what you're going through?

1044
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,320
 It's crazy out there, man.

1045
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,820
 Everybody fighting for your attention.

1046
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,380
 Feel like you gotta be a bigger, better you.

1047
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,420
 You're stuck in these ruts trying to build your empire

1048
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,540
 and God says, man, 100 years from now,

1049
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,640
 it's not gonna matter.

1050
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,180
 You wanna know who climbs up the hill

1051
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,780
 to be in my holy place and dwell

1052
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,540
 in the tent of the Lord forever?

1053
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,740
 Jesus did.

1054
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:54,180
 Jesus did, he did it for you, in spite of you,

1055
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,940
 on behalf of you, so that you might be with him

1056
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,980
 forever and ever and ever.

1057
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,420
 That's the gospel, that's the good news, man.

1058
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,740
 That is the good news of Jesus Christ.

1059
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,940
 That's what I want you to give your lives to.

1060
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,780
 And so as you follow that man, you're committed.

1061
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,300
 You keep your commitments, you represent him well.

1062
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,140
 Let me pray.

1063
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:23,660
 Father, we thank you for Jephthah

1064
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:29,460
 and we don't understand how he made it to the hall of faith

1065
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,100
 in Hebrews chapter 11, but we trust that he did some things

1066
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,420
 that you found worthy.

1067
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,620
 Father, we just confess to you, we've done nothing

1068
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,600
 that would make us worthy of you.

1069
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,300
 But Lord, we trust that you have in your commitment to us

1070
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,780
 and your love for us through the death and the resurrection

1071
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,540
 of your son, Jesus Christ.

1072
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,840
 God, we plead the cross and the cross alone,

1073
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,260
 the blood of Jesus alone.

1074
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,300
 We trust in Jesus and Jesus alone.

1075
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,260
 And we're so grateful for that unbelievable, undeniable,

1076
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,460
 radical, crazy commitment to us that you would sacrifice

1077
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,260
 your only child on our behalf to purchase us to yourself,

1078
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,660
 to be with you forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

1079
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,740
 and help the worries of our world fade against that reality,

1080
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,460
 help the troubles of tomorrow fade against that reality,

1081
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,960
 help the problems in our life fade against that reality

1082
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,840
 and the sins of our flesh fade against that reality.

1083
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,680
 Please, God.

1084
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,160
 Thank you for your commitment to us.

1085
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,760
 We trust in you and you alone.

1086
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:51,760
