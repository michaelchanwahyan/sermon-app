[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.200]   - All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.080]   so glad you're tuning in with us.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.040]   Like she said, last week was so amazing
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   getting to be together and gather in person.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.800]   It was also such a tease.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.480]   I know for me, I spoke too soon last week
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.520]   during the announcements,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.620]   and I am just sick that we did not get
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.600]   to be together this week,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.920]   but I am trusting that God is good,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.800]   He is faithful, and I am just thankful
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.440]   that we still get to gather through technology,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.280]   that we have the opportunity here to still meet together.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.760]   And so wherever you are, thank you for joining us tonight.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.800]   And I know that God still wants to speak to us,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.480]   even amidst all the crazy.
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.020]   And so if you're joining us for the first time,
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.400]   we are in a series called "Seven Deadly Sins,"
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.340]   where we are identifying different sins
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.480]   that a lot of people have said,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.680]   "Hey, these sins specifically,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880]   although all sins are equal,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.800]   these sins, if you let them have a stronghold
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.020]   or a huge grip in your life, they can ruin you.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.240]   They are deadly in their nature,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.620]   and so you have to be on your guard against them."
[00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.560]   And we've talked about things like anger and pride.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   We've talked about self-indulgence
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.040]   in terms of laziness and gluttony.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   And tonight, we get to talk about the deadly sin of greed.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.320]   And I know for me, by the way, if we haven't met, I'm JD.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.520]   And I know for me, one thing that's true of JD
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.680]   is I don't have a lot of stuff.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.040]   I'm just at that stage of life where I'm 26,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.940]   and I just don't have, I don't have my own house.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.360]   I've moved a lot in my young 20s,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020]   and I for sure don't think that I have a lot of money
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.480]   compared to some.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.880]   And so when I first was given this topic,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.080]   I was like, man, greed.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.240]   I mean, I guess I can tap into like something.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.600]   I guess I can hit something.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   But as I learned more and more about what greed looks like,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   I realized, wow, I am such a greedy person by nature.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840]   And I think a lot of us will be agreeing with that
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.880]   by the end of tonight.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.760]   And so let's lean in together
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.120]   and see what God's word has to say about this sin of greed.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.720]   And so here's one way that I identified
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.960]   what greed has looked like for me.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.460]   There was this thing, because of Corona,
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.700]   because of all the effects that it's taken on our economy
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.020]   and all the things that it's done to us financially,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.840]   our government passed something where people got
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.760]   what's something called a stimulus check.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520]   I had never heard of a stimulus check.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.480]   I didn't even know if I would receive a stimulus check.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.320]   I was like, all right,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.920]   am I gonna get some form in the mail?
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.600]   How will I know if I'm gonna get my STEMI?
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.280]   And so I guess one day was checking my bank account
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.880]   like I do every day.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.120]   And I was like, what?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.240]   Ta-ching, I saw a deposit that I didn't sign up for.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.760]   I didn't know how it got there.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.580]   I was like, I guess the IRS from my taxes know my stuff.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.400]   I don't know, but I'm not really asking questions.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.680]   All I see is I got money that I didn't work for
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.040]   and it felt good.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.520]   And what was my first reaction?
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.560]   I was like, man, I'm gonna save this.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   No, it was like, I'm gonna go out tonight.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.520]   Dinner is on me.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   I'm gonna buy those new pair of Nike's
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.680]   I've been looking at over there.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.540]   And I just was like, this is time for me
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.560]   to get myself something because this was money.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.880]   You know, I know for me, I mean, praise God.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.140]   I know there's a lot of people
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.380]   who really desperately needed that money.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.360]   And I'm so thankful that you were able to be provided for
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.200]   in that way.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.520]   But for me, luckily, like I've gotten to keep working.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.320]   And so this in my selfish mind
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.120]   just looked like some extra cash.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.960]   And so what do I do with my extra cash?
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.520]   I spend it on something extra with the extra self that I am.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.760]   And so I get my check.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.000]   And the first thing I thought was,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.520]   what can I do for myself?
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.200]   And what it for sure was not,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.040]   is there any way I can use this for others?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.140]   I mean, think about what a Christian,
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.080]   like what we claim to be about.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.300]   You would think that somewhere in there in my heart,
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.120]   somewhere inside of me,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.640]   I would think there are so many people right now
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.960]   who don't have a job.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960]   JD, you have a job.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.520]   There are so many people out there who have never had a job.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.580]   There are homeless people.
[00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.780]   There are sick people.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.800]   There are families in need.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.120]   And you would have thought maybe, just maybe,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.920]   I would have thought to help others out with my check.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.640]   But no, my first reaction was to spend it on myself
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.000]   because that's what greed does.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.360]   Greed makes life all about you
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.040]   and it makes it nothing about others.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.420]   But a lot of times we can't really see greed
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.080]   because greed, it wears a lot of mask.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.220]   It disguises itself in forms of things like,
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.280]   man, I'm being resourceful or hey, I deserve this.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.720]   I've been working really hard or hey,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.300]   I'm putting that into my savings.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.600]   It's good to save.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   Or hey, I'm just trying to be a good steward.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.120]   I need this money because one day I have a plan
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.200]   to upgrade for my family.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.440]   We're going to have more kids.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.660]   And it disguises itself in so many things
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.800]   that look good on the outside,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.840]   but on the inside, the motives are all out of whack.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.960]   And we're doing all of these things,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.360]   although them in themselves are not bad,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   we do them with wrong motives.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.000]   And deep down, we do it for comfortability
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.060]   and we do it for our own desires.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.760]   And I want to tell you this before we get started.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.040]   If you live this life,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.560]   if you live a life where you are convinced
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.820]   that you're not greedy, but yet somewhere in there,
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.080]   you're motivated by greed,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.380]   you're going to live this way that tells you,
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.480]   okay, in this, I'm going to find security and satisfaction,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.620]   but you never will.
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.220]   Instead, you're going to find an upbringing of anxiety
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.200]   and worry and comparison and discontentment
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.160]   and exhaustion from striving to succeed,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.960]   to achieve more and more and more.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.100]   And so I think it's important that we expose tonight greed
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.300]   for what it really is.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.140]   So that way we don't live a life slave to it.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.080]   And so I'm not going to teach you,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.020]   I'm going to let God's word teach you.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.160]   And so if you have your Bible,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.300]   let's see what Jesus teaches about this idea of greed.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.260]   As you get your Bible,
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.920]   we're going to read a lot of Bible tonight.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.340]   So if wherever you're at in your house,
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.740]   if you don't have your Bible,
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.020]   go get your Bible,
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.020]   grab it and open it up with me to the book of Luke 12.
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.380]   And while you turn there, for all my note takers,
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.820]   here's what we're going to be covering tonight.
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.280]   Tonight we're covering the difference
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.940]   between what greed says and what God says.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.780]   Okay?
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.540]   The difference between what greed says and what God says.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.460]   So the first thing, the first thing that greed says,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.420]   before we read the text,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.540]   is greed says, everything I have is from me.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.320]   But God says, everything you have is from him.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.260]   Okay?
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.160]   Greed says, everything I have is from me or because of me.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.420]   But God says, no, everything you have is because of him.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.820]   So Luke chapter 12, hope you're there.
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.620]   Jesus teaches more on this.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.620]   Here's a little bit of context.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.260]   A great crowd is gathering around Jesus
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.020]   and they're asking him all these questions.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.860]   He's starting to be identified as a great teacher.
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.540]   And this guy, we don't know who he is.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.700]   He raised his hand and he's like, hey, Jesus, my brother,
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.220]   he won't give me my half of our inheritance.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.100]   Can you go tell him, like, dad,
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.800]   can you go tell him to like give me half of our share?
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.780]   And Jesus looks at him and says,
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.300]   dude, I'm not the boss of you or your brother.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.860]   But then he kind of like goes off
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.420]   and gives a quick little dad lesson.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.780]   Here's what he says in verse 15.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.780]   Then he said to them, watch out, warning, caution.
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.080]   Be on your guard against all kinds of greed.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.720]   Life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.920]   And he told them this parable,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.680]   a parable we talk about them a lot here.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.840]   Luke is filled with parables.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.600]   They're basically just, that's just a way of saying a story
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.360]   that is kind of laced in wisdom
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.040]   and deeper insight for us to take away.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.240]   He says this parable,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.240]   the ground of a certain rich man
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.960]   yielded an abundant harvest.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.400]   He thought to himself, what shall I do?
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.600]   I have no place to store my crops.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.840]   And then he said, this is what I'll do.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.920]   I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.240]   And there I will store my surplus grain.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.480]   And I'll say to myself,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.600]   you have plenty of grain laid up for many years.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.880]   Take life easy, eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.960]   Talk about the American dream.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.720]   But God said to him, verse 20,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.620]   you fool, this very night,
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.580]   your life will be demanded from you.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.500]   Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.680]   This is how it will be with whoever stores up things
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.480]   for themselves, but is not rich toward God.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.960]   And so here's what this looks like today.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.240]   Just really quick, like modern day, this story.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.400]   Everyone at one point, hopefully, if you haven't, no shame,
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.320]   but if you've moved out of your parents' house,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.680]   you have built up things for yourself from your childhood
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.180]   and you have accumulated a lot of things.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.640]   And then you get to this point
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.840]   where you have to now move maybe to college
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.440]   and you have to move into this smaller room,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.200]   a dorm that you're sharing with someone else.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.920]   And everything you have cannot fit in this small space.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.880]   And so what do you do?
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.720]   You give it away to the needy and the poor.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.840]   No, that's not what you do.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.440]   You get your extra stuff and you put it in plastic bins
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.900]   and then you put it in like an attic,
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.880]   or some people go as far as to purchase
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.680]   or rent these things called storage units,
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.560]   where they literally pay people to keep their extra stuff
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.680]   that they think one day they'll need,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.200]   but in reality, it'll just contain dust
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.020]   and they might not ever see it again.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.880]   It's crazy.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.360]   And it's very normal here in America
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.880]   for us to build bigger barns
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.960]   like we see here in this guy's story.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.080]   A lot of us though, we don't even store our extra stuff.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.960]   We ain't even trying to hide that we're extra.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.220]   I know for me, I got stuff laying everywhere
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.560]   that I don't necessarily need
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.020]   and it's a whole lot of extra.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.140]   Things like shoes.
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.320]   I love shoes.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   I have a lot of shoes.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.280]   For some of you ladies,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.040]   you might have a lot of extra purses out there.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.120]   I don't wanna, I know I'm treading on whatever, but clothes.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.600]   I know for me, I have a lot of hoodies.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.520]   I'm a big hoodie guy.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.600]   I don't understand it.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.640]   Money.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.680]   And some of you right now are like, nope, trust me.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.760]   That's the one thing, pal,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.200]   especially right now with Corona,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.160]   I do not have an extra amount of money,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.200]   but then I think Jesus would even lean in and say,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.320]   okay, well then how are you paying for your Spotify premium
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.580]   or Apple music?
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.240]   How do you have Netflix, Hulu?
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.920]   How do you manage to somehow go out to eat all the time
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.680]   or go out every weekend?
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.040]   That Xbox you got, you have extra money.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.120]   Some of you, it might be extra time.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.640]   You might say, I'm too busy.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.000]   I don't have extra time.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I have too much going on.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.600]   And any free time I do get, I need it for me,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.680]   for #selfcare.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.520]   Haven't you ever heard?
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.620]   I need to rest.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.520]   And some of us, it might be our emotions.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.000]   Hey, I just only have so many.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.360]   This is my personality.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.480]   This is the way I am.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.360]   I can't be giving away all these emotions
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.320]   that are a lot of work for me.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.080]   And so we protect these things
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.720]   and we store these things for ourself.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.020]   And we think that all of the extra that we have,
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.940]   it has a place.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.180]   And that place usually doesn't involve other people.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.760]   It involves making our life more comfortable.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.860]   And these things, hear me, in and of themselves,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.900]   music isn't bad.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.780]   Xbox, not bad.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.360]   Netflix, but not bad.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.420]   God has given us things like music.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.700]   God has given us time and emotions,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.080]   but how we steward these things, how we use these things,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.520]   the why behind we have these things,
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.180]   says a lot about our relationship with those things.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.160]   It says a lot about where we are at in our heart with greed.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.820]   And I believe if you are so unsure,
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.460]   if you don't want to help other people
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.600]   and use your things with other people,
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.840]   if you protect your time and your space
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.160]   and your money and your things,
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.600]   and if you're the only one,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.120]   I would say that Jesus would want to share
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.140]   this story with you.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.200]   And so I think he still wants to share it with us tonight.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.120]   And so a lot of the reasons, hear this,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.200]   a lot of the reasons why
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.160]   we think everything we have is ours.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.840]   The reason why we're so quick to believe that greed,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.880]   when it says that what we own is ours,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.280]   is because we think we did something to get it.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.400]   We think that we earned the things that we have.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.880]   And so it's only natural to think,
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.480]   oh, well, if I earned this, if I achieved this thing,
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.900]   if I put in the work
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.760]   and then I received the benefits from it,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.160]   if I received the results from all of my work
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.540]   and my earnings, it's mine.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.480]   I get to dictate what I do with these things
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.700]   because they're mine, mine, mine.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.440]   And in verse 16 of the story,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.880]   we see this in this man's life.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.920]   He says, "The ground of a certain rich man
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.160]   yielded an abundant harvest.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.320]   He thought to himself, what shall I do?
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.680]   I have no place to store my crops."
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.120]   That's what greed does.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.680]   Greed keeps you isolated
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.040]   and it leaves you to make decisions on your own.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.460]   You don't invite God into your resources.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.920]   You don't invite God into your decisions
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.320]   of how you use your things and steward your things.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.040]   He thought to himself, he didn't invite his friends in,
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   he didn't invite, maybe even if he was married,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.200]   he didn't invite his spouse in.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.760]   He thought to himself, what shall I do?
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.880]   I have no place to store my crops.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.180]   And I'm reading this and I'm going, my crops?
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.480]   What do you mean my crops?
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.040]   Everyone knows in this day, if you're reading this,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.320]   if you're hearing this,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.920]   there was no machinery for farmers back in this day.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.320]   Everything that they got,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.800]   their harvest was solely dependent on the ground
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.880]   and the ground to have good soil was dependent on what?
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.120]   The rain and sun and light.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.760]   And I wanna ask who is in control of those things?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.600]   God.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.480]   God was in control of the ground.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.680]   God was the one in control of his bountiful harvest.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.880]   But greed doesn't let us see things that way.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.320]   Greed doesn't let us see our harvest
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.280]   through the lens of God being gracious and giving it to us.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.520]   Greed says, look at what you did.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   Look at how you earned.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.080]   Look at how you succeeded.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.440]   Look at all of the things that you now get to dictate
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.920]   what you do with it because you earned it.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.080]   (silence)
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.520]   I know for, I was thinking about this,
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.000]   sorry, I was just reading my notes.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.760]   And it says, remind them of what a toddler is like.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.600]   And I was thinking about how crazy it is
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.000]   that sometimes we think that we can look at God and say mine.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.280]   And it's been like this from the very beginning.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.480]   Toddlers, you give them a toy and they start playing with it
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.360]   and start figuring it out.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.280]   And they're like, this is nice.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.640]   And then you're like, hey, share with your brother
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.480]   or share with so-and-so.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.320]   And they're like, no.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.140]   And they start crying.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.280]   They're like, mine, mine, mine.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.520]   And what's crazy about that is it's not theirs.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.720]   It was given to them by other people who worked
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.560]   and got the money and went to the store and bought the toy.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.800]   A toddler cannot do anything for itself.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.240]   It only got the toy because its parents gave it to them.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.920]   And so it's the same with us.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.560]   For us to look at our things
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.560]   and to basically communicate to God, mine, I did this.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.240]   I paid for this.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.160]   I earned this.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.380]   It's crazy.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.760]   I'm here to remind myself and remind you guys tonight
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.720]   that everything we have is from God.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.020]   Nothing is ours.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:03.020]   Greed will say it's mine, but God says everything is his.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.620]   Greed will say, no, I took the extra four years of college
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.800]   to get this doctorate degree.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.200]   Greed will say, no, I put in the work on Saturdays
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.560]   when everyone was out partying.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.040]   Greed will say, no, I came out of the hole
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.400]   that was my family and came out of my small town
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.900]   and am now living the Dallas dream of success.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.440]   No, I put in the workouts and the dieting
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.400]   and the discipline to get to where I am today.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.320]   I, I, I.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.280]   And so therefore, because all of this was because of me,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.160]   when I received the benefits from my labor, it's mine.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:50.080]   And why are we so quick to claim the things that are good?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.680]   Like this guy was like my crops, my harvest.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.320]   If I'm like my promotion, my paycheck, my new shoes.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.240]   But yet the moment that things go bad in our lives,
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.980]   the moment that things don't go how we want them to,
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.720]   that's when we're like, this one's yours, God.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.800]   Like that's when I realized that I'm quick to put the blame
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.760]   and like the power in God's hand.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.280]   When things go bad, when I'm in a wilderness season,
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.600]   when I'm in a dry season, when storms come,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.720]   I'm like, God, it's yours, it's yours, take it.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.540]   You're in control.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.880]   I know you're in control, but when life is good,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.960]   when I don't need to depend on God, I'm like, it's mine.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   I've got it.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.700]   I got myself here.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.760]   But that's crazy 'cause the reality is,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.520]   is nothing has ever been ours to begin with.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.120]   I don't care how bad your life is right now.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.720]   I don't care if you're flourishing and thriving
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.440]   and Corona has brought you more work than ever before.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.240]   All of it is God's.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.760]   And God has always been the provider and sustainer
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.880]   of our flourishing, of everything that we have.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.320]   First Corinthians 10, 26 says,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.120]   "The earth is the Lord's and everything in it."
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.260]   Everything in it.
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:03.080]   And I know for me, when I started to get puffed up
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.360]   with my work ethic, when I started to get puffed up
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.280]   with my success or my promotion or my pay raise
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.900]   or my gifts or the things that I can do,
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:17.800]   I had to go to the word of God and remind myself
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.720]   that pride always comes before the fall.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.280]   Greed is tricky.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.020]   It tells you, hey, you have to do these things.
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.000]   You have to do these things
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.060]   so that way you can be comfortable.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.000]   You have to earn.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.420]   And so I have to go back to the word of God
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.620]   and say that it's never been about us earning.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.920]   It's never been about man doing.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.840]   It's always been about God's provision, God's faithfulness.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   And when I read the Bible and I remind myself
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.960]   of the stories that the Bible tells,
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.440]   that it's always been God.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.080]   God spoke and the earth was formed.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.560]   It was God who split a sea
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.360]   so his people could walk through it.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.880]   And then when they walked through the desert
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.560]   after he provided manna from heaven
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.700]   and sustained them and fed them.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:12.160]   It was God who flooded the earth and then refilled it,
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.040]   repopulated it and gave man a second chance.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.720]   It was God who sent up a man named Elijah
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.240]   in a tornado of fire.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.500]   It was God who defeated an entire army
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.440]   with nothing but a jawbone of a donkey.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.280]   Go read it.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.100]   It's in there.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.940]   It's a crazy story.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.240]   It was God who fulfilled prophecies.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.880]   It was God who brought his son to the world
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.440]   as a perfect God man
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   to pay for the penalty of all the mankind
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.160]   and defeated death.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.740]   It was God who told Peter to walk on water.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.080]   It was God who fed 5,000 plus their families.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.160]   It was God who blinded Saul,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.100]   a man known for killing Christians
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.540]   and then converted him and made him Paul,
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.120]   the leader of the church.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.020]   It was God who gave the blind sight.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.040]   It's God who gave the deaf hearing, the lame walking.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.760]   And it's the same God who is giving everything
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.360]   that we have today.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.560]   It's the same God that has you listening today
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   because he wants you to hear it's always been him
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.720]   who's provided for you.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.140]   You haven't done anything.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.680]   You've always needed him.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.360]   And so come to him like a child.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.520]   Don't go out and think that you earn something.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.960]   Don't go out and think that everything is yours.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.960]   Life is so much better when you admit that everything is his
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.920]   and none of it is yours.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.740]   But greed doesn't want you to believe that.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.720]   Greed wants you to think that you have a part to play.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.480]   Greed wants you to think that life is all about you.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.120]   And when life becomes all about you,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.520]   it becomes less about him.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.280]   And then life at first might seem like it's more enjoyable,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.800]   but it only gets more sad.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.440]   And then if you believe that,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.640]   it'll lead us to our second thing greed says.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.320]   Greed says, trust in yourself,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.600]   but God says, trust in him.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.000]   Greed says, trust in yourself.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.220]   You've got this.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.660]   But God says, no, trust in me.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.360]   Let's keep reading.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.240]   Jesus, he just keeps telling the story.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.480]   He looks at his disciples now
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.920]   after he's shared this parable.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.000]   And he says, "Therefore I tell you,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   do not worry about your life,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.720]   what you will eat or about your body,
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.320]   what you will wear for life is more than food
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:24.920]   and the body more than clothes."
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.480]   Verse 24, "Consider the ravens.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.960]   They do not sow or reap.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.400]   They have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.200]   And how much more valuable you are than birds.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.680]   Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.560]   Since you cannot do this very little thing,
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.640]   why do you worry about the rest?
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.680]   Consider how the wildflowers grow.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.480]   They do not labor or spin.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.520]   Yet I tell you not even Solomon,
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.380]   which was just a king, a character in the Bible,
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.680]   who was very wise and very rich.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.880]   Even Solomon in all of his splendor
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.100]   was dressed like one of these.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.640]   If that is how God clothes the grass of the field,
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.520]   which is here today and tomorrow is thrown under the fire,
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith?
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.440]   And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.560]   Do not worry about it.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.600]   For the pagan world runs after all these things
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.160]   and your father knows that you need them.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.480]   But this is important, but seek his kingdom.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.400]   And these things will be given to you as well.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.680]   Here's the problem of thinking we have to earn our things,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.760]   of thinking that it's up to us to provide for ourselves
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.620]   and for our families and for our children,
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.520]   to think that it's up to us
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.880]   to have a comfortable life and a joy-filled life.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.680]   When we believe that it is up to us
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.760]   to fulfill our needs and desires,
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.480]   then we send ourselves down a path that has no end.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.680]   It just keeps going
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.160]   because we were never created to satisfy ourselves.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.620]   We were never created to give ourselves all that we need.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.020]   God created us in his image and in such a way
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.360]   that he would know that we were thirsty.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.720]   He would know that we were hungry.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.680]   He would know that we would be in need.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.600]   And then he made himself
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.640]   where he could give us everything that we need
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.680]   and that he could know us better
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.220]   than we could even know ourself.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.800]   But if you get on the path of thinking,
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.620]   I can provide, I can do, I can earn,
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.360]   I can grow my savings account, I can grow my business,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.720]   I can build a bigger barn,
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.600]   you're only gonna become more worrisome,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.280]   you're only become more anxious.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.840]   And he says here, you're only gonna continue
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.960]   to chase after something that you're never gonna find.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.920]   But somehow we think life is easier
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.500]   if we can just work harder.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.500]   We think if I can work harder so I can earn more
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.500]   so that way I can feel more secure and have more control,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.280]   then I'm set, I'm good.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.420]   But if we truly have control,
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.940]   then why are we so full of worry and doubt?
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.440]   Think about that.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.320]   Why?
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.640]   Why are, if I have control, if I'm doing so much,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.400]   why am I so fearful?
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.020]   And why do I worry?
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.560]   And it's because most people think the core issue of greed
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.200]   is selfishness or needing more,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.280]   but the actual core issue of greed is fear.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.580]   The core issue of greed is fear.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.360]   Because when you think that you have to earn,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.960]   and when you think that your plan,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.560]   like you have to build a bigger barn to store your things,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.600]   when you don't come to God and ask him
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.760]   what he would have for you, you're saying,
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.800]   hey, I have to control everything
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.440]   because I have to know that I'm gonna have enough,
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.920]   which is also communicating that I'm afraid, God,
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.200]   that you're not actually who you say you are.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.000]   I know it says right here in this text
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.460]   that God looks at me and is like,
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.600]   hey, if he gives the food to the birds
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.860]   and if he closed the flowers,
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.680]   how much more would he give you the things that you need?
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.480]   He knows you, but just seek him.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.520]   He knows you.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.040]   I don't really believe that.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.840]   Or I would just trust him.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.700]   And I would ask him, hey, what do you want me to do?
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.820]   What are your plans for my life?
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.260]   How do you want me to steward my things?
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.840]   And I would take myself out of the equation
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.080]   and I would let God lead.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.220]   But we're fearful.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.280]   We're afraid to give up control.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.240]   And I don't know what it is.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.840]   It could be different for every person.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.340]   Something might've happened to you.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.180]   Someone might've abandoned you
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.780]   that was supposed to provide for you.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.740]   Someone might've broken your heart
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.780]   when they were supposed to bring you
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.500]   satisfaction and security.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.820]   Someone might have withheld something from you
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.780]   out of maliciousness.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.540]   I don't know what happened to you
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.780]   for you to project this onto God.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.320]   But I'm telling you, God does not fail.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.220]   God will not let you down.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.900]   He knows you and your needs more than you could.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.140]   And so all he asked you to do is trust,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.140]   trust in him, not in your things, not in your money.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.420]   We were talking about this earlier,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.480]   how funny it is that,
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.420]   did you know that on every piece of money that we have,
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.860]   I have here a $1 bill.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.860]   It reads, "In God we trust."
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.460]   In God we trust.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.260]   It's as simple as that.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.960]   But if you look around at America, no, we don't.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.460]   We clearly don't trust God
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.260]   because we put more trust in this.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.380]   We think that this can bring us something that God can't.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.060]   We say, I need more, I need more, I need more money.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:38.580]   I need to wear the on-brand stuff.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.660]   I need a better job.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.660]   I need a bigger promotion.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.540]   I need a bigger house.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.180]   I need more, I need more because God isn't enough.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.020]   That's what greed communicates.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.340]   And it's because deep down,
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.260]   we're afraid that God isn't actually good,
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.780]   that he isn't actually a father.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.220]   And so that's why greed says, trust yourself.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.520]   Because when you trust yourself, you think you get control,
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.460]   but that only leads to fear and worry.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:08.700]   Trusting God is where true joy and peace is found.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.420]   But if you follow greed,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.620]   and if you think that what you own is yours,
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.180]   and if you think that you can trust yourself,
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.900]   you're naturally gonna think the third thing that greed says.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.740]   Greed says life is about what you can get,
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.460]   but God says life is about what you can give.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.900]   Greed says life is about what you can get,
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.900]   but God says life is about what you can give.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.660]   Luke 12, let's continue reading.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:34.980]   Let's wrap it up.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.420]   Do not be afraid to trust yourself.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.540]   Do not be afraid, little flock.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.380]   So he's saying, don't be afraid.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:48.220]   For your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom,
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.840]   sell your possessions and give to the poor,
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.900]   provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out,
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.580]   a treasure in heaven that will never fail,
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.580]   where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.900]   For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.700]   Why did the guy in the first story that Jesus told
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.860]   build a bigger barn?
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:09.260]   Why did he think that was the right mood
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.620]   to make with his extra?
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.700]   Because he thought I need to store up for myself
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.200]   on this earth because this earth is where it's at.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.060]   This earth is gonna bring me joy.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.140]   I'm gonna work hard.
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.980]   I'm gonna put stuff into my 401k.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.980]   I'm gonna build so one day I can work hard
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.980]   and work hard and one hard
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.140]   'cause I have this dream one day that I get to retire
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.380]   and take this long trip around the world with my wife,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.420]   or I get to one day pay for my kid's college
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.060]   and I'm gonna work and work and work and work
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.700]   for this idea of this day that is not promised to us.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.140]   Like the man in the first story,
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.260]   he did all of this work to save and store all of his stuff.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.100]   And then God looks at him and says, you fool,
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.660]   you're gonna die tonight.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.300]   And you can think, you can be disillusioned to think
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.180]   that you have control of all these things.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.940]   But one thing that you cannot control
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.500]   is the number of your days.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.500]   You just can't.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:59.280]   God is the only one who knows
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.020]   when we are gonna leave this earth.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.640]   And so are you gonna trust in yourself
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.740]   and your limited view of life?
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.420]   Or are you gonna trust what the book,
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.980]   what the Bible is saying
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.580]   about how we're supposed to steward our things?
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.700]   Because it says here
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.300]   that you need to store up things in heaven, not on earth.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.800]   Don't build bigger barns on earth.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.500]   Who's gonna get those things?
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.000]   But store up things in heaven.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.580]   How do you store up things in heaven?
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.700]   By giving away things on earth.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.500]   The weapon to greed is generosity.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.640]   And so just a simple application that I had to deal with,
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.220]   this week is, have you ever tried asking yourself,
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.740]   Lord, what do you want me to do with my stuff?
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.420]   What do you want me to do with my extra?
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.760]   What bigger barns have I built in my life
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.820]   that I need to take down and give away?
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:56.220]   Take some inventory, identify your resources
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.420]   and ask God what he wants you to do with it.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.940]   And ask yourself, I mean, get honest with yourself tonight.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.380]   Make a list and say,
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.040]   if God asked me to get rid of all of this, could I do it?
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.900]   Could I give it all away
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.520]   and trust that God is who he says he is?
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.140]   And I know that would be hard for me,
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.800]   especially if I'm following myself
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.140]   and if I'm the one in control, because I would fail.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.920]   But if I'm putting all my chips in with God,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.160]   that is where an act of faith like this can take place.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.320]   Life is not about what this man thought.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.980]   Life isn't about your retirement.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.600]   Life isn't about taking it easy
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.080]   and eating and drinking and being married
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.720]   and getting more so you can do more.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.000]   That is a sad view of life
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.240]   if you think that's where life is found.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.540]   Jesus says here that life is nothing, it's a vapor,
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.480]   but heaven is everything.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.840]   So if you're going to invest, invest in heaven.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   And how does he call us to invest in heaven?
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.960]   By giving during our time on earth.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.300]   So I'll close with this.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.660]   Talking about investment.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:14.140]   If I could go back to JD at January 1, 2020,
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.160]   and I could say to myself,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.940]   hey, hey man, you should invest in Zoom.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.740]   Invest in Zoom and Purell.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.080]   JD, January 1 would be like, what?
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.400]   It's like, what is Zoom and why Purell?
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.200]   Like I'm a Germex guy or is that the same thing?
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.040]   I don't know.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.200]   But point is, is I would look at myself
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.160]   and be like, you're crazy.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.240]   I am not investing in Zoom.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.920]   No one uses Zoom.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.840]   He's like, no, trust me, man.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.600]   You're going to want to invest in Zoom.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.560]   And I'm like, ah, get out of here.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.200]   You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.880]   And then now, how would I view that conversation?
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.640]   I'd be like, ah, I should have listened to future JD.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.480]   I would be making a fortune right now.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.760]   It's crazy that I did not listen to him.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   And in the same way, it's crazy, crazy
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.040]   if we live our life listening to greed
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.880]   and not listening to God.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:13.440]   Because God says that everything that we see is his,
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.680]   not ours.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   God says that when we trust him,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.480]   we'll experience joy and peace and life.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:34.200]   And God says, life is not found in what you get,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.080]   but what you give.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.120]   That's where life is found.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   But it's like, but I'm getting less out of the deal.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.720]   I'm literally losing something.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   How is that more for me?
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   This week, I came across a couple of hundred bucks
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.760]   that I wasn't expecting to get.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.800]   And for me, that's a really big deal.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.960]   I don't get to just like take those things lightly.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.040]   And I was like, wow, I have a couple of hundred bucks.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.720]   And I started to lean towards new shoes.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.680]   And I was like, no, save it, save it.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.400]   And I put it on the table.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.800]   And for the last couple of days,
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.480]   I've been prepping at the same table
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.000]   that the $200 was sitting at.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.080]   And I'm writing this and I'm like looking at it.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.560]   And I'm like, I have been writing all of this message
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.920]   and not once have I asked God,
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   God, what do you want me to do with that?
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.240]   And so I tried it.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.960]   I took him at his word and I was scared
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.720]   of what he was gonna say 'cause it was uncomfortable.
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.440]   I was like, please don't ask me to give it away.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.380]   Please don't make me give it away.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.400]   And what'd he do?
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.720]   I read the scripture and he asked me to give it away.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.320]   Along with some other things.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.440]   One of those things being my time.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.040]   I'm really selfish with my time.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.380]   He asked me to start giving away,
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:04.120]   I talked about it earlier, but my emotions.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.440]   There are certain people that I'm so closed off with
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.280]   because I don't trust them.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.040]   That's just wrong, that's not love.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.400]   And he said, hey, none of these things are yours.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.960]   And I had to ask myself, why is it so hard for me
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.000]   to give away something that God says is so small?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.240]   And it's because I forget the biggest thing
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.480]   that's been given to me.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.600]   I forget that the biggest act of generosity
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.560]   came in the form of a baby born in Bethlehem in a manger.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.400]   God sending his one and only son.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.560]   He wasn't greedy, he was generous
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.680]   and he sent him for me and for you.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.240]   And he sent him down to live a perfect life
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.080]   and to pay the price that you and I could not pay
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.240]   by dying a sinner's death, Philippians says.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:57.560]   He was equal to man, yet he did not sin.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.560]   And he died a sinner's death on the cross for you and for I.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   So that way we could live a life of joy and peace and trust
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.040]   that the father is gonna provide for us
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.480]   in ways that we never could provide for ourself.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.120]   In the ways that we were never designed
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.440]   to provide for ourselves.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.640]   The father is the answer.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.760]   Our relationship with Jesus is the answer.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.560]   And when I start to remind myself
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.760]   that because Jesus was so generous with me,
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.200]   I now wanna live my life to be as generous as I can be.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:35.040]   I wanna live my life the way that he's called me to.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.000]   And I'm sitting here going, God, okay, I'll surrender it.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.720]   If you've called me to give it all,
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.960]   then I will give it all.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.760]   If you call me to move to Africa and live in a hut
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.400]   and never get married and share the gospel with people,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.240]   I'll do it.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.600]   And that terrifies me because I somehow still believe
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.480]   that this earth is end game.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.680]   But my Bible says that this earth is nothing
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.400]   compared to what's to come in heaven.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.680]   So when I am fighting greed,
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.400]   when I am no longer wanting to be generous, what do I do?
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.040]   I remember heaven.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.560]   I remember Jesus.
[00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.760]   I remember the price that he paid.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.120]   And that compels me to put myself aside,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.800]   to put my things aside and to make everything
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.240]   about the thing, which is Jesus.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.960]   And it's so crazy.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.480]   This like view that's so upside down for us,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.720]   especially those in America,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   where it's like, hey, life is found
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.440]   when you give away your life.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.840]   You try it, you take the risk,
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.680]   and he does what he says.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.440]   And it may not look like you think,
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.400]   but that's the point of following a God
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.920]   who knows what we truly need.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.560]   And so just to recap, I'm done.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.320]   I'm done thinking that everything is mine.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.720]   And I'm trusting that everything is God's.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.000]   I'm done thinking that I am enough
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.680]   and that I can trust myself.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.320]   I'm gonna start trusting God.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:10.240]   And I'm done thinking
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:16.840]   that when I somehow get to this plan for my life,
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.040]   that when I get enough, it'll satisfy me.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.320]   And I'm gonna start believing
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.680]   that true life is found in giving,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.800]   just like Jesus gave himself for me.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.200]   Let's pray.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:37.440]   Father, I understand that
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.120]   (sighs)
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.840]   I have such a limited view and understanding of who you are.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.120]   I have such a small understanding
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.120]   of what you truly want for me on this earth.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:38:01.200]   But I pray tonight that we would be a people,
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.960]   if we are in Christ, that we would trust
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.400]   that that is the greatest decision that we can ever make.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.680]   That is the greatest thing that we could ever obtain,
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.960]   not because of something that we did,
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.840]   but because of all that you've done.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.760]   And if there's someone here tonight who says,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.520]   man, I'm just having a lot of trouble letting go of control.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.880]   I'm afraid.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.600]   I've been testing out the waters of this whole like God thing
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.440]   and this Christian thing, and I'm so afraid to dive in
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.960]   because what if God withholds from me?
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.480]   What if God isn't all who he says he is?
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.280]   I pray tonight that you would reveal yourself to them,
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.840]   that they would open up your word and read the scripture
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.080]   and see that it is not a lie.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.000]   It is true.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.280]   It is trustworthy, and it is for them.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.480]   No matter what they've done,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.000]   no matter what they've gone through, it is for them.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.880]   You are for them.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.840]   You are a gracious father who loves to provide
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.280]   for his children who just open up their hands
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.720]   and say, I trust you.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.760]   And so that's what we do in this time.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.600]   We respond with opening up our hands all across the country,
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.840]   all across the world.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.280]   We are a people who are coming,
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.600]   opening up our hands right now and saying,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.120]   I relinquish my rights.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.520]   I relinquish my things.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.000]   I relinquish my control.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.680]   And I trust you, the God who has always been
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.080]   and will always be in control.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.760]   Let's respond to that and agree to that in worship.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.340]   (wind howling)
