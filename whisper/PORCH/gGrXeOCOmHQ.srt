1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,020
 - Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,720
 (congregation cheering)

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,040
 Come on, come on, it's great to be with you.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,520
 We are continuing a series called First Comes Love,

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,860
 and I thought I'd start with my proposal story, okay?

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,760
 How I propose.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,460
 You know us, right, ladies lean in,

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,080
 do that fast clap, you know?

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,480
 And so here it's, you know, prepare yourself.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,900
 Here's what was going on.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,040
 I was dating a young lady named Monica,

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,160
 and it was going places, so I thought.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,880
 And I was sitting there and I'm like, you know what?

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,840
 She's my best friend's sister, and I love her family,

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,600
 and I don't think, you know, breaking up's gonna

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,680
 go well for me, so maybe I should get married.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,960
 And I was like, man, if you're gonna get married,

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,240
 isn't that romantic?

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,000
 If you're gonna get married, you gotta buy a ring.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,640
 In the United States of America,

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
 the way that we do this culturally is you buy a rock.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,120
 And I didn't know much about buying a rock,

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,600
 so I start kinda brushing up on my diamond knowledge,

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,920
 and I decide, you know what?

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,660
 I don't know if we're gonna get married next week,

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,280
 next month, next year, but sooner or later,

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,160
 I'm gonna need a rock, and so I might as well

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,240
 pull the trigger on this.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,600
 And so I'm gonna buy an engagement ring,

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,400
 and so I go where everybody goes to buy an engagement ring.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,440
 I go to eBay.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,440
 And I'm on eBay, and I'm looking at the engagement rings,

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,720
 and there's one that has, it says in the description,

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,760
 it's appraised for $23,000.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,480
 And the next thing you could bid on this auction was $1,600.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,540
 So I bid, that was about my budget, so I bid $1,600,

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,340
 and I just go on about my life.

39
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,560
 And then I go and check my email like a week later,

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,180
 and it says you won this auction.

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,940
 I'm like, what auction?

42
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,780
 (congregation laughing)

43
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,260
 Like, what did I win?

44
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,820
 Oh, crud.

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,620
 And so I call the guy.

46
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,460
 There's an 800 number.

47
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,280
 It's a reputable.

48
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,980
 He's got a good feedback rating,

49
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,860
 reputable company in New York City.

50
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,700
 I call him.

51
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,520
 I'm like, hey, I won the auction.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
 I won the ring.

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,480
 He's like, oh yeah, I can't sell you that.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
 I'm like, no, it's a no-reserve auction.

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,600
 You have to.

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
 I won it.

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,720
 And he's like, no, we go back and forth.

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,760
 I'm like, what are you talking about?

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,080
 You can't sell me the ring.

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
 I won the ring.

61
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,740
 You gotta send it to me.

62
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,040
 It's a legal binding bid.

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,320
 Send me the ring.

64
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,680
 And I wasn't a believer.

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,960
 I probably used some choice words.

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,800
 And so I just kind of, we get off the phone,

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,360
 and I paid, I sent the money, PayPal and all that,

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,320
 and I hear something outside in my apartment complex,

69
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,460
 and I open the door, and my outdoor apartment complex,

70
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,620
 like in the outdoor hallway, there's sitting a little box,

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,140
 and I'm like, they just left it outside?

72
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,080
 I get it, and I open it up, and I'm like,

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,460
 there's no way this thing's real.

74
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,500
 There it is, this beautiful little piece of ice.

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,060
 It's right there, sparkly and pretty and all,

76
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,180
 and I'm like, there's no way this thing's real.

77
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,280
 And so I go straight to the jewelry store,

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,520
 you know, and I give it to the jeweler.

79
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,360
 I'm like, hey, can you see if this thing's real?

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,160
 And he like hooks it up to some machine,

81
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,640
 and he's like, yeah, it's real.

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,720
 I'm like, hey, can you tell me what it's worth?

83
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,240
 And he's like, no, I need to send it off to do that.

84
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
 I'm like, what do they do to send it off?

85
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,000
 He says, it's the four Cs.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
 I'm like, well, what are the four Cs?

87
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,040
 He says, well, they're gonna look at the color,

88
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,960
 the cut, the clarity, and the carat, how much it weighs,

89
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,480
 and that's what they're gonna do

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,080
 to determine that it's worth.

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,340
 And I'm like, well, I don't have time for that.

92
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,060
 I put the ring in my pocket, and I had to wake up.

93
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,700
 My girl's graduating, and I'm like,

94
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,220
 I think I just got my graduation present, you know?

95
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,380
 I had some brand new golf clubs for her,

96
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,300
 just in case, you know, a backup plan.

97
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,900
 She didn't even play golf, but.

98
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,740
 (congregation laughing)

99
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,620
 I got a good deal on some women's golf clubs.

100
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,820
 And so I was like, all right,

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,860
 some golf clubs or an engagement ring.

102
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,060
 We go down there, and you know, I'm a pagan idiot,

103
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,380
 if you know me, I'm not walking with Christ at this time.

104
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,620
 And we go down there, and we party,

105
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,500
 and I drink too much, and almost get in a fight.

106
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,580
 And here's the deal I didn't propose.

107
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,580
 By the grace of God, I did not pull that ring

108
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,040
 out of my pocket, because if I would've pulled

109
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,100
 that ring out of my pocket, she would've said yes,

110
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,160
 and it would've been a disaster.

111
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,460
 It would've been a nightmare.

112
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,260
 In fact, there were a lot of people in our lives

113
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,460
 at that time saying, hey, you guys should break up.

114
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,300
 Two people specifically in our lives at that time

115
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,580
 just said, hey, you guys are a disaster,

116
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,540
 you're manic highs, manic lows,

117
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,280
 you guys shouldn't be getting married,

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,100
 you shouldn't propose, y'all shouldn't even be together.

119
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,420
 And so what I wanna talk about

120
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,820
 for the next few minutes together is,

121
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,740
 ladies, how do you know he loves you?

122
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,540
 How do you know his love is genuine?

123
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,640
 One day you're gonna care about the four Cs of a rock,

124
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,940
 the color, cut, clarity, and carrot.

125
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,180
 I wanna give you five Cs to determine

126
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,780
 if a man's love is genuine.

127
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,060
 Five Cs to inspect.

128
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,980
 Men, if you're here, don't tune out.

129
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,260
 This is five Cs that you can know and understand.

130
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,220
 Are you at a place where you might pop the question,

131
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,020
 where you might drop the L bomb?

132
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,140
 These are the questions that we're gonna cover tonight

133
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,600
 is how do you know if his love is genuine?

134
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,020
 Men, what does leading look like in dating?

135
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,500
 How do you know when it's time to pop the question?

136
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,000
 Or like I said, say I love you.

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,660
 How do you know if you feel like there is,

138
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,380
 or I'm sorry, what do you do if you feel like

139
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,020
 there is no chemistry or no prospects

140
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,060
 to have chemistry with?

141
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,860
 And so girls, I know that, I don't know if you know this,

142
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,620
 but you guys can be a little schizophrenic

143
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,260
 in what you want from us, okay?

144
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,940
 (congregation laughing)

145
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,940
 Yeah, you're like, I want him to be strong but gentle.

146
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,100
 (congregation laughing)

147
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,460
 I want him to be courageous but sensitive, you know?

148
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,980
 I want him to be fun but serious.

149
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,540
 How do you be fun and serious, you know?

150
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,780
 Give us a break, you want us fun or you want us serious?

151
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,620
 Who do you want, right?

152
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,980
 I've come to the conclusion

153
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,780
 that you don't know what you want.

154
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,840
 (congregation laughing)

155
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,940
 And tonight I'm gonna tell you what God wants for you.

156
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,820
 From the scriptures, we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians 13,

157
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,100
 if you know anything about the Bible,

158
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,220
 this is the chapter on love.

159
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,760
 Paul's writing to a church in Corinth

160
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,660
 that has misunderstood what love is,

161
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,140
 so if you're in a place where you've misunderstood

162
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,500
 what love is, this letter's for you.

163
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,260
 And he's going to tell us plainly,

164
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,060
 hey, this is genuine love.

165
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,700
 And he says something a little later on

166
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,940
 that makes me think he's talking about

167
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,380
 the way a man should love.

168
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,580
 And so that's what we're talking about.

169
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,160
 How do you know if he loves you?

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,940
 1 Corinthians 13, verse one.

171
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,160
 If I speak in tongues of men or of angels,

172
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,900
 but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong

173
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,740
 or a clanging cymbal.

174
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,620
 This is a verse that's been often misunderstood.

175
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,960
 It's simply saying this.

176
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,260
 If someone comes and they says all the right things,

177
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,340
 'cause ladies, no offense, but sometimes

178
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,740
 you guys are suckers for just the right words.

179
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,580
 Like a fella can, a guy can woo you

180
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,380
 with just a little bit of a game.

181
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,020
 Don't fall for that.

182
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,120
 And he's saying, hey, he comes in and he's winsome

183
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,780
 and he knows exactly what to say

184
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,220
 and he's saying lines that you tell

185
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,180
 and all your friends are cheesy,

186
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,360
 but in reality you go home and you feel so swooned.

187
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,440
 He said, hey, it doesn't mean he loves you.

188
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,700
 It could just be words.

189
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,540
 It could just be words.

190
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,740
 And then he says it's like a gong.

191
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,740
 You know, it comes on fast and hard and heavy

192
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,460
 and you feel all these things.

193
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,540
 He's like, it's like, oh!

194
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,560
 But it fades.

195
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,640
 He gives us this picture.

196
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,480
 Of love.

197
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,380
 It's like this.

198
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,720
 (loud gong)

199
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 It's loud.

200
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,800
 And heavy.

201
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
 And emotional.

202
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,380
 And gone.

203
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,440
 It's beginning to fade the second it starts.

204
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,040
 It will not last.

205
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,800
 You've got to look past the words.

206
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,520
 If I have the gift of prophecy

207
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,660
 and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge

208
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,960
 and if I have faith that can move mountains,

209
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,880
 but do not have love, I am nothing.

210
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,540
 He may be really smart and wise and have a great job.

211
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,900
 He may have went to med school.

212
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,980
 He may have graduated summa cum laude.

213
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,380
 I don't know, right?

214
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,220
 But if the brother can't love you, keep going.

215
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,620
 If I give all I possess to the poor

216
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,480
 and give over my body to hardships that I may boast,

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,700
 but do not have love, I gain nothing.

218
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,460
 He's saying something really key here.

219
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,880
 He might go to Haiti.

220
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,120
 He might serve the widows and the orphans.

221
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,020
 He might have memorized scripture.

222
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,320
 It doesn't mean he knows how to love you.

223
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,340
 You're going to have to inspect something else.

224
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,020
 So what do you inspect?

225
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,200
 We're gonna go five C's, you ready?

226
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,960
 The first one, okay, is he cherishing?

227
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,680
 Can he cherish you?

228
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,480
 This is the first C.

229
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,880
 Paul is going to continue to talk about genuine love,

230
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,840
 and he says in verse four, love is patient.

231
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,920
 Love is kind.

232
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,020
 What does it mean that love is patient?

233
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,080
 Despacito.

234
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,060
 That ain't what it means.

235
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,300
 That ain't what it means.

236
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,960
 Is he weight on you?

237
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,840
 Does he weight on you?

238
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
 Does he care for you?

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Is he constantly walking in front of you,

240
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,800
 hurrying off, men, can you hear me?

241
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,140
 Lean in, brother.

242
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,800
 Chivalry's not dead.

243
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,600
 Okay, these are God's daughters, your sisters.

244
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,540
 You care for them.

245
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,540
 My dad used to tell me, if I was ever with a girl,

246
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,480
 and he said, if you ever walk in this house first,

247
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,320
 you're gonna go back outside and stay outside.

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,000
 And you know, that stayed with me,

249
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,340
 that you've gotta care for them.

250
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
 That is your job.

251
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,800
 God made us different, and he put you here

252
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,320
 to protect them, and to care for them,

253
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,840
 and to provide for them, and I know that gets lost

254
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,080
 in your modern culture and vernacular,

255
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,120
 and the things that you're reading in the news,

256
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,300
 but don't forsake this ancient book of eternal truth.

257
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,760
 And ladies, I don't care if you're so hardcore

258
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,460
 and women's lib, and you're on your own,

259
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,080
 and you're independent, I know there's something

260
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,720
 deep down inside of you that wants this.

261
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,060
 You want a man to care for you.

262
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,700
 You want that, I know you do.

263
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,140
 I've talked to a lot of you.

264
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,440
 So does he do this?

265
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,860
 Ladies, I gotta tell you this,

266
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,740
 some of you, you don't think you're worth this.

267
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,380
 And that's because you're getting your worth

268
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,920
 from somewhere other than Christ.

269
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,480
 God has made you in his image.

270
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,020
 He made them in the garden, male and female.

271
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,740
 And ladies, you wait for a guy who will cherish you men.

272
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,420
 Listen, I get asked all the time,

273
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
 what if there's not chemistry?

274
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,340
 What if I'm not physically attracted?

275
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,300
 Listen, here's the simple question, here's the answer.

276
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,120
 You ready?

277
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,300
 I'm gonna answer it right now.

278
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,340
 Can you, men, I'm talking to you men,

279
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,000
 can you cherish her?

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,200
 For the rest of your life,

281
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,960
 will you choose to cherish her,

282
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,580
 treat her like a princess, make her feel beautiful,

283
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,740
 make her the only object of your affection other than God?

284
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,920
 That she's the one you think about,

285
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,980
 that she's the one that you're coming home to joyfully?

286
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,320
 Can you do that?

287
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,820
 If you can, awesome.

288
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,300
 If you can't, then communicate clearly that you can't

289
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,960
 and that this is not going anywhere.

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,460
 Stop wasting time.

291
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,760
 1 Peter 3, verse seven, it says,

292
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,480
 "Husbands, in the same way be considerate

293
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,660
 "as you live with your wives and treat them with respect,"

294
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,680
 it says, "to honor them as the weaker partner

295
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,740
 "and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life

296
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,100
 "so nothing will hinder your prayers."

297
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,620
 It says, "If you marry a girl you don't cherish,

298
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,380
 "your prayers won't be answered."

299
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,440
 That's high stakes, man.

300
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,460
 If you marry a girl that you are not committed to cherishing

301
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,560
 God ain't listening.

302
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,000
 And it's a challenge, guys.

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,540
 It's not the work of boys.

304
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,480
 The reason I didn't propose, by the grace of God,

305
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 is 'cause I was a child.

306
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,200
 I was a little boy.

307
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,540
 This is not boys' work, 1 Peter 3, seven.

308
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,280
 I was married just this week in marriage.

309
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,060
 In fact, next week my wife and I

310
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,840
 will celebrate 13 years of marriage.

311
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,000
 We've been married for 13 years.

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
 Praise God.

313
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,560
 And I planned an amazing anniversary trip with her.

314
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,060
 And so we were gonna go to Mexico.

315
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,820
 I booked the resort, I paid for it.

316
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,840
 This is where we went on our honeymoon.

317
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,020
 And so I thought, hey, let's go back there.

318
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,720
 It's gonna be awesome, I'm so excited, I'm pumped.

319
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
 And I'm closer, and she's like,

320
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,240
 I'm feeling uneasy about Mexico.

321
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
 I'm like, why?

322
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,920
 She's like, well, there's earthquakes.

323
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,880
 I'm like, that's somewhere else.

324
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,980
 She's like, well, there's hurricanes.

325
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,120
 There's Jose, there's Maria.

326
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,580
 I'm like, they're going other places.

327
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,780
 She's like, well, there's, you know,

328
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,660
 they're poisoning the alcohol.

329
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,820
 I'm like, you don't even drink.

330
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,160
 What's going on?

331
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,460
 And here's what's going on.

332
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
 She's just as uneasy.

333
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,820
 She's like, there's cartel violence.

334
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,080
 I'm like, I'll protect you.

335
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,420
 (congregation laughing)

336
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,260
 And,

337
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:18,680
 and as it got closer, we're leaving next week.

338
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,520
 What she's saying is, hey, I don't wanna go to Mexico.

339
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,560
 And what I promised her 13 years ago

340
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,820
 is I'll put your interest in front of my own.

341
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,620
 I'll lay down my life to serve you.

342
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,020
 And so in those disagreements,

343
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,820
 there's the question I gotta ask is how can I serve her?

344
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,520
 So I called and I canceled.

345
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,360
 I said, where do you wanna go?

346
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
 Let's go somewhere you wanna go.

347
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,960
 Let's go somewhere there's no earthquakes

348
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,540
 and hurricanes and cartel, poisoned alcohol

349
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,820
 for those that do that, you know.

350
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,720
 How can I put her interest in front of my own?

351
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,420
 An easy way to know if a guy's patient and kind,

352
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,820
 he's gonna cherish you, it's the physical stuff, man.

353
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,620
 It's the physical stuff 'cause here's the deal.

354
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,860
 Like, if he likes you, then when he's with you,

355
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,320
 his body is going crazy and he wants you, you know,

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,920
 like naturally in his flesh, he desires all of you.

357
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,420
 That's how God made us, God made us.

358
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,020
 And if that man restrains that,

359
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,480
 then you know he's communicating something beautiful to you.

360
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,980
 Do not mistake that.

361
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,920
 Ladies, especially those of you

362
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,080
 that have became Christians recently,

363
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,220
 you know a lot of times when you come

364
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,820
 from immoral relationships, you're like,

365
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,320
 does this guy even like me?

366
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,620
 Like, he doesn't touch me.

367
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,820
 And that's a good thing, okay.

368
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,620
 Do not mistake that as a bad thing.

369
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,680
 That's a good thing.

370
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,180
 You're not his, that's why he's not touching you.

371
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,640
 You're God's daughter, that's why he's not touching you.

372
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
 And so you put that in the positive category,

373
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,340
 this man is patient, he's restraining,

374
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,980
 his natural carnal urges for you.

375
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,980
 And if he doesn't, he's communicating something

376
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,540
 really clearly, it's a really clear communication.

377
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,240
 He's saying, hey, I do not honor marriage

378
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,680
 and I'm committed to being physical outside of marriage

379
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,740
 and in fact, if I marry you, I will go outside

380
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,040
 that marriage because I don't honor marriage.

381
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,680
 He's also communicating something else.

382
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,100
 I don't fear God.

383
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,280
 I'm not afraid of God.

384
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,340
 I know that 1 Thessalonians 4, verse six

385
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,780
 says that we're not to be sexually immoral

386
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,380
 and it says that if we are, the Lord will punish

387
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,980
 all those who commit such sins.

388
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,580
 And he's saying, hey, I'm not afraid

389
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,480
 that you're God's daughter.

390
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,140
 I'm gonna do what I wanna do and I wanna do it,

391
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,480
 I'm not patient with you, I'm not cherishing you.

392
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,980
 Boyfriends do not get husband privileges.

393
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,880
 Can you hear me?

394
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,300
 Boyfriends do not get husband privileges.

395
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,840
 And so ladies, does he cherish you?

396
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,940
 Men, can you commit to cherishing her?

397
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,340
 Second C is we're inspecting his love.

398
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,680
 Is it real, is it genuine?

399
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,040
 The second C is is he confident, not conceited?

400
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,180
 The one that comes from the scripture

401
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,640
 is the one conceited.

402
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,940
 Conceited is excessive pride in oneself.

403
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,180
 Conceited is a fake version of confidence.

404
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,940
 Conceited or conceit rather is the cubic zirconium

405
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,340
 of diamonds.

406
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,940
 It's not real, okay?

407
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,040
 You're gonna have to really lift this one up,

408
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,380
 hold it to the light and expect it closely.

409
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,780
 Is it confidence that comes from trusting a huge God

410
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,980
 that God is in control and sovereign over his life

411
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,840
 and has a plan and a purpose for him

412
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,980
 and is taking him somewhere?

413
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,080
 Is it that kind of Christ-centered confidence

414
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,340
 or is it conceited that says, hey, look at me,

415
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,940
 look at me, look at me, look at me.

416
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,340
 It's about me, look, I'm gifted, I'm fast, I'm cute.

417
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,980
 You know, I got a good job and a fast car.

418
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,220
 Look at me, right?

419
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,720
 Is it conceit or is it confidence

420
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,020
 and you have to be able to discern the difference.

421
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,380
 Conceit says look at me.

422
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,380
 A Christ-confident man says look at him.

423
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,740
 His life says look at him.

424
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,520
 Confidence comes from trusting a big God.

425
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,240
 Conceit comes from feeding a big ego.

426
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,520
 A man who is stuck on himself has no regard for God.

427
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,400
 You went to high school with this guy, right?

428
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,340
 The arrogant guy.

429
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,680
 You know, remember the arrogant guy?

430
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,000
 I remember the arrogant guy so well.

431
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,180
 And what was frustrating about him,

432
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,840
 he was constantly stuck on himself.

433
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
 He walked around like a peacock, you know.

434
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,780
 He had the bright red convertible car and I'm not angry.

435
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,840
 And what really frustrated me then and a little bit now

436
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
 is he always had the beautiful girlfriend.

437
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
 In fact, he would jump from one beautiful girlfriend

438
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,900
 to the next beautiful girlfriend.

439
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,940
 He would treat them like trash.

440
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
 And you're sitting there and you're scratching your head.

441
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,520
 I mean, am I alone in this?

442
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,620
 You always wonder why the jerk, arrogant guy

443
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,620
 ends up with the sweet, pretty girl, right?

444
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,700
 Here's why.

445
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,100
 'Cause she's also conceited.

446
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,360
 And that's why she goes with him

447
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,740
 because he's an accessory to her.

448
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,280
 And she's making an exchange.

449
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,940
 She's okay if he treats her like trash

450
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,640
 because she thinks that she deserves that guy.

451
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,620
 And so she's spending a lot of time putting on the makeup,

452
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
 a lot of time in the mirror.

453
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,700
 She's also vain.

454
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,580
 Vain people find vain people.

455
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,600
 It's just the way it works.

456
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,380
 And that's the answer to why do they end up with the jerk?

457
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,980
 'Cause there's vanity there too.

458
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,720
 There's vanity there too.

459
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,820
 With genuine love, with genuine love,

460
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,060
 selfishness turns to service and even sacrifice.

461
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,380
 With genuine love, selfishness turns to service

462
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,860
 and even sacrifice.

463
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,020
 And so if you sense, ladies, that he loves himself

464
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,220
 more than anything else, run as fast as you can.

465
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,060
 You are looking for someone who loves Jesus more than you.

466
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,180
 That is, more than he loves you and more than you do.

467
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,280
 And so, ladies, if God has your heart,

468
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,160
 if God truly has your heart,

469
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,580
 you woke up this morning thinking about Creator God

470
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,780
 and his sacrifice through his son, Jesus Christ.

471
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,180
 If that's what marks your life,

472
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,580
 this man is gonna have to go to God for your heart.

473
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,220
 And to go to God for your heart

474
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,980
 is going to take Christ-centered confidence.

475
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,060
 But if he's conceited, he's not gonna be able

476
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,900
 to see God past himself.

477
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,340
 He's gonna be too focused on him.

478
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,100
 Do not believe the lies of the world

479
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,180
 that you want a guy like that.

480
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,300
 You do not.

481
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,740
 That will make a miserable marriage.

482
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,860
 So the next C is controlled.

483
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,940
 Is he controlled?

484
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,220
 Number three, is he controlled?

485
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,820
 Controlled by the Spirit.

486
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,840
 Does he walk around with a chip on his shoulder

487
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,500
 from the baggage from his father or his ex-girlfriend

488
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,580
 or his upbringing or job loss or his boss?

489
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,800
 Is he just angry?

490
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,020
 Paul says in verse five,

491
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,580
 "This kind of love is not easily angered.

492
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,340
 "It keeps no record of wrongs."

493
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,120
 Anybody here know an angry scorekeeper?

494
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,420
 They're walking around with a tablet on their heart

495
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,180
 and they're just writing down all the people

496
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,940
 who have hurt them and they walk around

497
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,260
 and they're hurt and they don't understand

498
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
 the forgiveness of Christ

499
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,620
 'cause they haven't forgiven others.

500
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,220
 There's no joy in their life.

501
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,580
 And if there is, it can quickly turn back to anger.

502
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,220
 They're explosive and volatile.

503
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,680
 And maybe you're like, well, he's not that way with me.

504
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,220
 That's because you're interviewing

505
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,540
 or he's interviewing, right?

506
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,180
 You're right, he's not that way with you.

507
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,060
 He's interviewing.

508
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,660
 But if he's that way with others,

509
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,860
 it's going to be that way at you sooner than you think.

510
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,860
 It's going to happen if that sort of explosive anger, rage,

511
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,220
 a lack of reconciliation, if that marks his life.

512
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,700
 It says here in this text,

513
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,480
 this love does not envy and it always trusts.

514
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,060
 If he's jealous and controlling, constantly overbearing,

515
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,460
 this comes from a lack of trust.

516
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,140
 The reason he has that lack of trust

517
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,220
 is because he's not trustworthy.

518
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,740
 Speak from experience right now.

519
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,100
 The reason he doesn't trust you

520
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,060
 is because he doesn't trust himself.

521
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,540
 And it's not the controlled by the Spirit

522
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,980
 that we see in the scripture.

523
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,460
 But let me hit a little disclaimer here.

524
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,380
 'Cause every now and then I'll talk to girls

525
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,180
 and they're like, yeah, he's so jealous.

526
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,740
 You know, like my best friend's a boy, a guy.

527
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,880
 And you know, yeah, he calls me all the time

528
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,980
 and texts me late at night.

529
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,160
 He just texts me good night every night, no big deal.

530
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,980
 You know, yeah, my best friend's a guy,

531
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,820
 but he's so jealous.

532
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,660
 That's weird.

533
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,020
 Can I tell you something that really unpopular?

534
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,780
 You'd be tempted to be angry at this.

535
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,460
 You were not meant to have a best friend

536
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,720
 that's the opposite sex.

537
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,060
 You hear me?

538
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,740
 I'm serving some of you really well right now, okay?

539
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,040
 You were not meant to have a best friend

540
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,220
 who is the opposite sex.

541
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,060
 God didn't make us that way.

542
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,960
 Someone's heart is always drifting.

543
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,580
 If you don't think so, you're being naive.

544
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,240
 Most likely you're feeling an emotional void

545
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,420
 with that friendship.

546
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,860
 And you don't even realize it.

547
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,820
 Maybe it's subconscious.

548
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,300
 But you were not made,

549
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
 you never saw Jesus do this, right?

550
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
 And man, Jesus, where's Jesus?

551
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
 Oh, he's just hanging out on the boat with Mary, you know?

552
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,340
 Just catching fish, flirting, friendationship.

553
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
 It's all good.

554
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,100
 That's not cool, man.

555
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,300
 That's not right.

556
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,660
 There's something wrong with that.

557
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,780
 Some of you are so uncomfortable right now.

558
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,220
 But I'm telling you,

559
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,120
 that wasn't the way, it doesn't match up with God's design.

560
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,980
 Man and women were meant to come together.

561
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,980
 That's God's design.

562
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,240
 And usually a heart is drifting

563
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,700
 whether you know it or not,

564
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,100
 whether you realize it or not.

565
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,400
 And that's a red flag.

566
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,980
 So it says here, to go back to that text,

567
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,660
 it says, "He keeps no records of wrongs."

568
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
 Is he keeping score?

569
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,500
 You don't wanna marry an angry scorekeeper.

570
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,620
 Guys, if you're bitter all the time,

571
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,700
 you gotta get help, man.

572
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,540
 I mean, just get help.

573
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,360
 We're here for you.

574
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,200
 We love you.

575
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,220
 We wanna help you heal.

576
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,220
 I've seen some really angry, vengeful guys

577
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,300
 find healing in Christ.

578
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,140
 We can help you.

579
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,340
 Just come up and ask for help, you know, if that's you.

580
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,500
 Because here's the deal, man.

581
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,220
 Kids are gonna come into the picture.

582
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,020
 That dude is gonna be the disciplinarian.

583
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,100
 He's gonna be spanking your babies.

584
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,420
 And you don't want an angry man spanking your babies.

585
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,420
 Man, you're not just interviewing for the role of husband.

586
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,780
 You're interviewing for the role of father.

587
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,300
 And you don't wanna take those daddy wounds

588
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,800
 and just pass them on, like a tall gene

589
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,700
 or something else, right?

590
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,920
 You want 'em to stop with you.

591
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,300
 You want that to die with you.

592
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,100
 And that takes work.

593
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,940
 It takes a man.

594
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,700
 It says, "Hey, I'm up for it.

595
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,580
 "There's some undoing that needs to happen

596
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,080
 "in my heart and in my life.

597
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 "I've gotta find some healing.

598
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,100
 "I need help."

599
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,420
 We'll help you.

600
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,320
 You're not alone.

601
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,160
 The fourth C is a clear conscience.

602
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,900
 Does he have a clear conscience?

603
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,540
 Paul's gonna say in verse six,

604
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,520
 is he cleansed by the truth?

605
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,760
 And then he says this other thing,

606
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,260
 that this love that he's talking about,

607
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,180
 it does not delight in evil,

608
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,100
 but it rejoices with the truth.

609
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,740
 So it doesn't delight in evil.

610
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,460
 Some of us are entertained by the things

611
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,140
 that Christ died for, which is not okay, right?

612
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,300
 Some of you men here, you regularly invite,

613
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,620
 satanic influences in your life

614
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,140
 by what you listen to, what you watch,

615
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,300
 what you say, and what you look at.

616
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,420
 Every day on the regular, weekly,

617
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,900
 you're saying, "Hey, Satan, come and influence

618
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,020
 "my heart and my mind."

619
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,300
 And you're so taken away from it.

620
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,980
 You're so far down the current of culture in this,

621
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,900
 you don't even realize what you're dancing to,

622
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,180
 what you're bobbing your head to.

623
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,900
 You don't even realize that the show that you can't miss

624
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,520
 is satanic in nature,

625
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,060
 that it's the things that cost Christ his life,

626
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,540
 that it's evil and wicked,

627
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,500
 and that it's influencing your heart

628
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,340
 and it's training you to look for all the wrong things

629
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,220
 so that it will keep you single and desperate

630
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,140
 and discontent and depressed.

631
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,140
 Nobody wants to be depressed,

632
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,220
 but so many people pursue depression

633
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,020
 by what they feed their minds and their hearts,

634
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,500
 what they listen to, what they watch,

635
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,260
 what they look at, what they say.

636
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,980
 There's a,

637
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,660
 there's like in a diamond,

638
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,620
 you can buy a cloudy diamond on the cheap,

639
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,220
 like if it's not bright and shiny,

640
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,180
 it's called included, inclusions,

641
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,740
 and there are coal deposits in the diamond

642
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,900
 that make it cloudy, make the sun not bounce through it.

643
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,340
 In the same way, if someone has evil influences

644
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,540
 in their life, their mind and their heart gets cloudy.

645
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,740
 They're influencing you and leading you

646
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,180
 with a cloudy heart,

647
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,540
 and it's going to have a greater impact

648
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,580
 than anyone could imagine,

649
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,700
 and again, I say this from experience.

650
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,860
 There's evil that a guy participates in

651
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,940
 that will cloud his thinking,

652
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,140
 and so what are some things?

653
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,020
 I just, like if you're drinking on the regular,

654
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,980
 like if you're getting drunk,

655
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,580
 if you look past this weekend,

656
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,740
 and you're the party guy, you're the weekend warrior,

657
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,020
 like you can't wait to get to the bar,

658
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,100
 you got your drink of choice,

659
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,700
 like you're probably a future alcoholic,

660
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,420
 and that's just kind of the way that works.

661
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,460
 You're becoming something.

662
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,340
 You don't realize that the fun that you're having now

663
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,740
 is costing you something later.

664
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,180
 It's probably costing you now, too,

665
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,580
 so this is something to inspect, right?

666
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,180
 If he likes to get physical now,

667
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,860
 he's probably gonna be unfaithful later.

668
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,660
 He's communicating something to you.

669
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,700
 He's saying, hey, I'm willing to be physical

670
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,540
 outside of marriage.

671
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,140
 I don't hold marriage sacred,

672
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,460
 and so you gotta know and understand that,

673
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,420
 and then this is a big one.

674
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,180
 I want you to lean in for this one.

675
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,300
 If he looks at pornography now,

676
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,460
 you're not gonna satisfy that man.

677
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,900
 It's not an addiction to sex.

678
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,540
 It's an addiction to variety.

679
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,740
 No porn addict, I've talked to thousands,

680
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,500
 literally thousands,

681
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,620
 no porn addict looks at the same picture

682
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,020
 over and over and over and over and over.

683
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,020
 You're training your brain not for monogamy,

684
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,540
 but for polygamy, polyamory,

685
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,860
 for variety,

686
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,740
 and no woman here is gonna satisfy that man.

687
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,740
 It's an impossible, sensational appetite,

688
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,620
 and brother, listen, I know right now you feel so awkward.

689
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,140
 You know in the past six months,

690
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,540
 maybe in the past six weeks,

691
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,700
 and maybe in the past six hours,

692
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,300
 you've looked at porn.

693
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,180
 You need to get help.

694
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,100
 You will not heal from this thing on your own.

695
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,900
 Listen, I've done cocaine.

696
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
 I've done ecstasy.

697
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,820
 I smoked weed every day for a long season.

698
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,580
 I've never been addicted to anything

699
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,740
 or gripped by anything like pornography.

700
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,300
 I thought I'd look at porn for the rest of my life.

701
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,940
 You've got to get help,

702
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,380
 and it's work.

703
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,020
 I'm not talking about a phone call

704
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,140
 or one confession's gonna heal you.

705
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,980
 It's work.

706
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,100
 Show up every Monday night here, 6.30 at Regent.

707
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,420
 Listen, let me make this really clear.

708
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,620
 I'm gonna make it binary for you

709
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,980
 so you can just kind of put yourself in my,

710
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,580
 if you've looked at pornography in the past six months,

711
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,380
 I wanna see you here this Monday at 6.30

712
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,100
 and get help.

713
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,540
 You gotta, I'm done.

714
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,460
 You're done with it.

715
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,660
 That thing is ruining your marriage

716
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,500
 long before you've met your prospect.

717
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,900
 And it's, you know, ladies,

718
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,900
 if you feel like guys aren't attracted to you

719
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,140
 or they're only like a certain kind of girl

720
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,020
 or no one's asking you out

721
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,180
 and you wanna blame something, blame porn.

722
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,340
 Blame sin, blame Satan, blame pornography.

723
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,380
 It's a big reason.

724
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:35,740
 If that's your journey, I wanna tell you I'm so sorry.

725
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,580
 I'm so sorry.

726
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,420
 I don't know when you were exposed to it.

727
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,380
 I don't know when it started.

728
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,360
 I don't know when you looked at the first image.

729
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,980
 I know it comes now through your phone

730
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,220
 and through the internet.

731
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,820
 Man, I know what it's costing you.

732
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,660
 You may not.

733
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,060
 I do, I know oh too well what it's costing you.

734
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,580
 I'm so sorry that you set foot on that path.

735
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,380
 It is time to get off.

736
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,200
 It is time to step off that road,

737
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,640
 to end that journey and to get healing

738
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,480
 for the sake of your children,

739
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,560
 for the sake of your wife,

740
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,720
 for the sake of your children's children.

741
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,080
 We need to spend more time rejoicing with the truth

742
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,040
 than delighting in evil.

743
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,320
 And some of you, you spend more time listening to trash,

744
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,940
 watching trash and looking at trash

745
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,600
 than you do in God's word.

746
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,880
 And it's no wonder that your mind is trashed.

747
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,800
 It's no wonder.

748
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,360
 It's a simple math problem.

749
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,420
 I get this email every single week.

750
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,260
 It's the same email.

751
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,340
 I put it in a category.

752
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,500
 And so if you're listening, I'm not talking about you.

753
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,600
 I'm talking about hundreds and hundreds of you.

754
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,300
 It kind of starts out, hey, JP,

755
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,900
 I need some relationship advice.

756
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,740
 It's complicated.

757
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,480
 It's always complicated.

758
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,840
 That's the first paragraph.

759
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,900
 And then it goes into these crazy nuance,

760
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,860
 like listen, I like the beach and he likes the mountains

761
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,440
 and this and that and I'm this theology

762
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,340
 and I have this background and this and whatever.

763
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,180
 And then it gets into, the third paragraph is usually,

764
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,180
 and lately, we've been physical

765
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,500
 and once I thought I was pregnant

766
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,900
 and then this happened and now this.

767
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,900
 Or he's looking at pornography and this is where we're at.

768
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,940
 And that third paragraph is usually the climax

769
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,900
 of the problem that's happening.

770
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,260
 And then the fourth paragraph is usually what do I do?

771
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,260
 And I always wanna respond with just a simple two words,

772
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,020
 break up.

773
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,540
 But I don't.

774
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,860
 (congregation laughing)

775
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,020
 But I don't.

776
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,060
 But I want to.

777
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,660
 Because it's what you need to do.

778
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,340
 And so I can be pastoral in my words

779
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,220
 and I can put some flowery language around it,

780
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,300
 but in reality, you're not married.

781
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,780
 And so you have the benefit of the ability

782
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,140
 to end a relationship that's not God-honoring.

783
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,820
 And what you need to do is you need to break up

784
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,700
 and you need to get healing.

785
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,540
 And if you guys, your path crosses,

786
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,620
 your believers later on, praise God for that.

787
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,060
 But there's something so much bigger

788
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,620
 than your relationship, your idolatrous relationship.

789
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,300
 There's another relationship that's so much more important.

790
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,340
 In fact, this whole book,

791
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,660
 like if this whole book is about a relationship,

792
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,740
 the part that's about men and women, it's about that much.

793
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,460
 The rest of it, that much of it,

794
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,260
 it's about another relationship, one much more important.

795
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,940
 Some of our lives don't say that.

796
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,300
 Some of us hadn't talked to them in a long time.

797
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,580
 Some of us hadn't spent an hour reading this book

798
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,420
 in a long time.

799
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,980
 Some of you, you never have, not in your entire life.

800
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,500
 Can I suggest a reprioritization?

801
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
 Make an investment in the marriage

802
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,260
 that you don't have today.

803
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,820
 And begin to put God first, make Christ ultimate.

804
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:39,980
 If your conscience is clear,

805
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,100
 however, 'cause we just talked about breaking up,

806
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,900
 if your conscience is clear,

807
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,180
 then it should lead to a commitment.

808
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,220
 And that's the fifth C.

809
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,780
 What's he committed?

810
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,620
 Does commitment mark his life?

811
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,820
 In verse seven, Paul is gonna use the word always a lot.

812
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,900
 Verse seven, this kind of love Paul talks about,

813
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,740
 it always protects, it always trusts,

814
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,100
 it always hopes, it always perseveres.

815
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,300
 Ladies, listen, if he's constantly trying to change you,

816
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,940
 he's not committed to you,

817
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,660
 he's committed to what he thinks

818
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,020
 he might be able to make you.

819
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,820
 Marriage is not a strategy on changing someone.

820
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,460
 You don't marry somebody

821
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,500
 hoping they're gonna become someone else.

822
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,700
 You marry them with all their weird idiosyncrasies,

823
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,060
 their messiness, their uncleanliness.

824
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,820
 In fact, I remember I dated a girl before Monica,

825
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,900
 and she would always go to my mom and she's like,

826
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,940
 "He's so messy," you know, 'cause I am.

827
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,780
 And so disorganized and gross, you know,

828
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,380
 and we broke up.

829
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,580
 And then I started dating Monica.

830
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,700
 And my mom would be like,

831
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,820
 "Does it bother you that he's messy?"

832
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,820
 And she's like, "Eh, nah, doesn't bother me."

833
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,580
 And my mom said at that moment

834
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,820
 she knew Monica was the one for me,

835
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,060
 because she wasn't trying to make me somebody else.

836
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,020
 She was gonna live with my craziness,

837
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
 and she has for 13 years, pray for her.

838
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,260
 And she wasn't trying to make me someone else.

839
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,020
 And so I'll turn that,

840
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,580
 'cause usually it's guys trying to change somebody.

841
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,100
 Stop it, you've got a lot of options.

842
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,260
 If you want someone else, choose someone else.

843
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,900
 If you want the person that you're with,

844
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,260
 then embrace who God made them.

845
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,900
 I'm not talking about their sin struggles, right?

846
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,300
 I'm not talking about like,

847
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
 that the Lord's not gonna sanctify them,

848
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,540
 but don't make that your hope, right?

849
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,820
 Like if they don't change,

850
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,140
 you're not gonna love them forever.

851
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,620
 That's not commitment.

852
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,940
 Man, I gotta talk to you about something

853
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,180
 before we wrap up.

854
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,660
 A huge part of being committed is communication.

855
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,260
 Man, I need you to hear me on this one.

856
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,060
 I need you to communicate clearly.

857
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,540
 Communicate where this is going, what you hope in,

858
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,740
 what you trust, what you're persevering in.

859
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,580
 What leading looks like in dating is communicating.

860
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,060
 It looks like certainly abstaining from the physical,

861
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,720
 that's a real test of leadership.

862
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,980
 But the other aspect of leading in dating

863
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,780
 is communicating well, 'cause fellas,

864
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,700
 let me tell you something.

865
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,660
 Girls wonder about everything.

866
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,420
 They wonder when you're gonna call back

867
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,220
 and what you're thinking and where this is going

868
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,500
 and are we even in a relationship and does he like me

869
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,940
 and when's he gonna call me again

870
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
 and where's he gonna take me?

871
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,180
 They just wonder all the time.

872
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,060
 And so if you wanna lead in a relationship,

873
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,420
 listen, leaders remove confusion.

874
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,260
 Let me say it again.

875
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,540
 Leaders remove confusion.

876
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,460
 Don't let her wonder

877
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,080
 because you're clearly communicating.

878
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,080
 Men, listen, if you like her, say I like you.

879
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,860
 (congregation laughing)

880
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,960
 If you, listen, listen.

881
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,200
 Listen, listen, 'cause it gets better.

882
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,180
 If you wanna go out with her,

883
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,880
 say I'd like to take you out.

884
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,220
 Guys say, I'm like, I go ask her out.

885
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,640
 They say, well, I don't know how.

886
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,960
 Go up to her.

887
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,880
 (congregation laughing)

888
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,720
 Look her in the eyes and like a man,

889
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,800
 you say, I would love to take you out.

890
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,680
 It makes you vulnerable.

891
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,020
 She may say no.

892
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,380
 You're gonna be okay.

893
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,160
 Tomorrow's gonna come.

894
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,040
 It's gonna be great.

895
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 Okay, it's all, all's gonna be okay.

896
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,520
 You're gonna grow through it.

897
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,380
 But you look her in the eyes and you say,

898
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,960
 I would love to take you on a date.

899
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,800
 What I didn't say is messenger on Facebook

900
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,360
 or poker, whatever that means, you know.

901
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,680
 Never do that.

902
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,540
 Or listen, or text her.

903
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,600
 It's like I tell my four-year-old

904
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,040
 who grunts and moans and whines a lot.

905
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,700
 I say, listen, Weston, listen, use your words.

906
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,560
 Use your words, men.

907
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,180
 God gave you vocal cords.

908
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,040
 Speak.

909
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,240
 Communicate clearly.

910
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,400
 Tell her where this is going.

911
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,320
 I know some of you men, you're looking at me like,

912
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,080
 like you want me to do what?

913
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,840
 You want me to speak to her?

914
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,800
 It's gonna be really important in marriage.

915
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,600
 Listen, your marriage is gonna be defined

916
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,160
 so much more by the way you communicate

917
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,080
 than all the physical stuff.

918
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,200
 I know that's crazy and mind-blowing right now.

919
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,760
 I know that's crazy.

920
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,880
 But listen, the physical stuff

921
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,040
 is not gonna ruin your marriage.

922
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,140
 Communication will.

923
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,280
 A healthy marriage is much more contingent

924
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,800
 on the way you communicate

925
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,740
 than how often you're having sex or being intimate.

926
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,160
 Trust me, all you can do is trust me right now,

927
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,460
 but one day, one by one, you will come back

928
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,920
 and say you were right, JP.

929
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,280
 God was right when you were reading that.

930
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,800
 One time I was, we went to Austin,

931
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,480
 friend and I, and you know, we were partying there

932
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,640
 and we weren't walking with Christ.

933
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,920
 And we were coming back and he was playing this dumb game

934
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,080
 where he wasn't putting his hand,

935
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,720
 he was driving, but he wasn't driving.

936
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,240
 He would put his hands down.

937
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
 And I'm in the passenger seat and I'm like,

938
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
 dude, hold onto the steering wheel.

939
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,560
 You know, we're driving down I-35.

940
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,800
 I'm like, drive the car.

941
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,760
 And he's like, what, drive this car?

942
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,960
 I'm like, hey, that's not funny.

943
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,320
 Drive the car, man.

944
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,360
 Like, put your hand, 10 and two right now, come on.

945
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,880
 And it's uncomfortable.

946
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,240
 It's uncomfortable when someone's

947
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,920
 not committed to going somewhere.

948
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,560
 Men, do you hear me?

949
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,840
 Like, let her know where you're going.

950
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,080
 Drive, put your hands, 10 and two,

951
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,120
 and say, okay, hey, this is where I want you to know.

952
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
 This is what I'm thinking.

953
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,360
 This is how I feel about it.

954
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,800
 If you're like, well, I don't know, well, figure it out.

955
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,320
 Take some time and get with God and journal

956
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,440
 so that you can tell her, hey, this is what's going on.

957
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,480
 Is he committed?

958
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,000
 Is he committed to communicating clearly?

959
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,920
 Is he committed to Christ?

960
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,920
 Is he committed to the right things?

961
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,920
 Here's why, guys, why I would say drive somewhere.

962
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,400
 'Cause you're dating.

963
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,840
 And can I tell you a little secret?

964
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,080
 Dating is awful.

965
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,080
 Like, if you think of singleness, dating, and marriage,

966
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,120
 dating is by far the least fun.

967
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,600
 By far.

968
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,920
 Like, singleness, 1 Corinthians 7 singleness,

969
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,920
 Matthew 19 singleness, like singleness

970
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,640
 for the sake of the kingdom, it's awesome.

971
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,000
 Like, you can jump on the train, you can go to,

972
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,600
 train, does anybody take the train?

973
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,160
 (congregation laughing)

974
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,200
 You can go to Africa, don't take the train.

975
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,840
 You can go to Haiti, you know, you can go to Europe,

976
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,920
 backpack through Europe, like, you're single, man.

977
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,120
 There's so much things you can do.

978
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,320
 You can risk your life for the sake of the kingdom

979
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,120
 when you're single in ways you can't when you're married.

980
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,800
 But when you're dating, like, it's the interview.

981
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,160
 You know, it's not fun.

982
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,600
 Who likes the interview?

983
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,080
 Like, you go and you put on your power tie

984
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,960
 and you walk in and you present yourself

985
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,720
 and you're all vulnerable and then you go home

986
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,920
 and you're like, are they gonna call me back?

987
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,160
 I don't know, they said they would, I don't know.

988
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,320
 You know, it's like, where's it going?

989
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,840
 Hey, did you hear back from, I haven't yet,

990
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,200
 but they said that, and you just sit

991
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,280
 in this vulnerable spot, that's dating.

992
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,600
 Like, it's fun, like, when you get the job, that's fun.

993
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,280
 Okay, now, okay, we're committed to each other.

994
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,880
 That, now we got something.

995
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,240
 Dating is awful.

996
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,360
 Like, stop believing the world, like, it's a new category.

997
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,520
 It's not even in here.

998
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,520
 You know, we invented it just to punish ourselves.

999
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,800
 (congregation laughing)

1000
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,280
 Right, it's not fun.

1001
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,320
 And so, get the show on the road.

1002
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,800
 Like, I'm a huge fan of dating for a little while,

1003
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,800
 short engagements, get married, have babies, make disciples.

1004
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,640
 (congregation laughing)

1005
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,600
 Heard it here first.

1006
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,200
 It's like marriage, marriage is buying,

1007
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,440
 dating is shopping, dating without the intentions

1008
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,000
 of marriage is shopping with no money.

1009
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,320
 And what's gonna happen when you shop with no money?

1010
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,720
 You're gonna leave frustrated, or you're gonna take

1011
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,080
 something that didn't belong to you.

1012
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,640
 But those are the only two outcomes.

1013
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,060
 So, the only reason that we date is because God gave us

1014
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,740
 the gift of marriage, and we're trying to get there.

1015
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,540
 If you don't wanna be married, don't date.

1016
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,340
 Be single for the sake of the kingdom.

1017
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,180
 If you're like, I don't really wanna be married right now,

1018
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,620
 cool, then you don't wanna date right now.

1019
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,020
 It's the only reason we date, is to get married.

1020
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,860
 All right, I've meddled.

1021
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,220
 What I need some of you guys to hear tonight,

1022
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,620
 and I say this with a pastor's heart, a shepherd's heart,

1023
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,020
 'cause I love you, and the same way I wanna respond

1024
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,700
 to that email breakup, what I need some of you

1025
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,540
 to hear tonight is grow up.

1026
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,580
 Stop being a boy.

1027
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,400
 It's time to become a man.

1028
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,580
 Paul says this, "When I was a child, I talked like a child.

1029
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,280
 "I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.

1030
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,280
 "But when I became a man, I put childish ways behind me."

1031
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,300
 And so, ladies, boys might be fun for a date,

1032
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,600
 but they make miserable husbands.

1033
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,900
 You need a man.

1034
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,540
 You need a 5C man, a man who will love you

1035
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,140
 like God has called him to love you,

1036
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,140
 one who will cherish you, who's not conceited, but committed,

1037
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,460
 one who's going to care for you like this passage says.

1038
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,940
 And so some of you, you're like, well, where are they?

1039
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,340
 I mean, I don't know any men like that.

1040
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,180
 Do they exist?

1041
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,620
 Let me show you something, okay?

1042
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,060
 Here's a little chart, okay?

1043
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:58,060
 There are 3.72 billion men, 3.72 billion, 3.72 billion.

1044
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:03,100
 That's what that represents.

1045
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,300
 Of those men, guys who are 20 to 35 and single,

1046
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,100
 so porch goers, right, porch going age,

1047
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,740
 20 to 35 and single, there's 312 million of those men.

1048
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,580
 Of the 312 who are 20 to 35 and single,

1049
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:22,100
 of those men, 31% call themselves Christians.

1050
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,020
 It's about 101 million.

1051
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,020
 Of that number that calls themselves Christians,

1052
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,260
 by our very best estimate,

1053
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,260
 30 million of them are following Jesus.

1054
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,180
 30 million of them are running hard after Christ.

1055
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,020
 30 million of them are 5C men.

1056
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,380
 And so the bad news is there's only 30 million.

1057
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,060
 The good news is there's 30 million.

1058
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,060
 30 million, but you've gotta weed through the 3.72 billion.

1059
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,260
 How are you gonna do that?

1060
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,860
 Five Cs, all right?

1061
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,100
 Can he cherish me?

1062
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,900
 Is he conceited?

1063
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,740
 Is he controlled by God's spirit?

1064
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,140
 Does he have a clear conscience?

1065
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,100
 And is he committed to the right things?

1066
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,500
 And you might be like, man,

1067
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,980
 I just feel like nobody's asking me out,

1068
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,100
 like I'm being overlooked,

1069
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,740
 that guys only are attracted to a certain kind of girl,

1070
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,460
 and you're tempted to be despair

1071
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,780
 that there's no good guys,

1072
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,060
 and you feel like you've been left behind,

1073
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,340
 lots of you nodding your head,

1074
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,700
 like yes, that's how I feel.

1075
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,140
 Listen, thank the Lord Jesus Christ.

1076
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,620
 Thank God that he's kept away all those others

1077
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,660
 that are not attracted to the things

1078
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,860
 that God's attracted to.

1079
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,580
 That has so much more to do with the man

1080
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,340
 that's your maturity than anything else.

1081
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,140
 And so don't despair, thank God that he's protected you

1082
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,220
 from marrying somebody whose heart he does not have yet.

1083
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,420
 And use your singleness to go back

1084
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,820
 and listen to that message from a few weeks ago.

1085
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:13,100
 It's not super practical, the five Cs.

1086
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,340
 You're like, but how do I know?

1087
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,740
 Do I ask him on the first date?

1088
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,620
 Hey, can I, will you cherish me?

1089
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,460
 (congregation laughing)

1090
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,580
 I wouldn't do that.

1091
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,500
 I wouldn't do that.

1092
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,820
 You know, date number one, are you committed to this?

1093
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,020
 (congregation laughing)

1094
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,020
 I wouldn't do that.

1095
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,260
 Here's how you know.

1096
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,340
 It's a bonus C.

1097
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,460
 It's his life built on Christ.

1098
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,300
 If his life is built on Christ,

1099
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,180
 then you're gonna know it.

1100
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,180
 Like another thing that girls will say is like,

1101
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,820
 when do I tell him that I'm saving myself for marriage?

1102
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,220
 Or, you know, how do I know if he's this guy?

1103
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,260
 I'm like, man, way before the first date.

1104
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,620
 Like I wouldn't spend any time with anybody

1105
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,940
 who you do not know that their life is built on Christ.

1106
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,620
 Because you know what, here's what happened, guys.

1107
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,820
 I didn't propose by the grace of God

1108
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,540
 on that day when we went to Waco.

1109
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,180
 What happened is I came back to Dallas

1110
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,620
 and someone invited me to a church.

1111
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,140
 Man, I was so consumed myself, narcissistic.

1112
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:18,180
 I was a mess, but I stumbled into a church.

1113
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,060
 And I began to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ,

1114
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,100
 that my pornography addiction, my cocaine use,

1115
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,500
 my partying, my drinking, my clubbing, my abuse of women,

1116
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,620
 that Jesus died for that.

1117
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,460
 It was this amazing message that captivated my heart,

1118
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,440
 that God sent his son, that he loved me so much,

1119
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,440
 that he gave his Weston, his Jesus, to die for my sins.

1120
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,220
 And he defeated death, he raised him from the dead,

1121
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,940
 and my heart got around that message

1122
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,420
 that I didn't have to pay for my sins

1123
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,680
 because someone else did.

1124
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,220
 That was great news to me.

1125
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,300
 I submitted my life to that Christ.

1126
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,580
 I said, Jesus, listen, I don't wanna drive anymore.

1127
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,860
 I've driven in and out of bad relationships.

1128
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,340
 I've driven to destruction.

1129
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,220
 I've driven to addiction.

1130
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,460
 I've driven to hurts, habits, and hangups.

1131
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,740
 Jesus, you drive.

1132
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,460
 You created the world, you made me,

1133
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,340
 you gave me purpose, you drive.

1134
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,080
 And what happened is he came in my life like a flood,

1135
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,220
 like a hurricane, and he began to turn things upside down,

1136
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,860
 he began to deal with that addiction,

1137
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,780
 he began to deal with the hurts, the habits, the hangups,

1138
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,140
 he introduced healing, and he changed me

1139
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,180
 from the inside out.

1140
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,020
 The physical stuff between Monica and I was done.

1141
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,620
 We sat down, said, hey, I don't think

1142
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,700
 we should do that anymore.

1143
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,060
 She said, I've been telling you that.

1144
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,740
 I said, I'm so sorry, you have.

1145
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,620
 I haven't been listening.

1146
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,020
 I've been doing what I wanna do.

1147
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,300
 I haven't been patient or cherishing.

1148
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,380
 I've been self-centered and conceited.

1149
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,500
 Will you forgive me?

1150
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,780
 I'm committed to pursuing Christ with you.

1151
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,820
 He's changed my life.

1152
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,060
 We started going to church together.

1153
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,160
 That was our new date.

1154
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,200
 He changed everything, and you know what happened?

1155
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,260
 I realized dating wasn't very fun.

1156
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,500
 I'm like, hey, man, dating's like all the challenges

1157
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,340
 of marriage and none of the benefits.

1158
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,340
 I was sitting at dinner with her

1159
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,340
 and another couple that said a year before

1160
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,260
 that there's no way we should even get married,

1161
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,780
 much less date or anything.

1162
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:25,020
 I got down on one knee, and I handed her a rock

1163
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,340
 because our lives were built on the rock of Jesus Christ.

1164
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,820
 We had been talking about Jesus.

1165
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,100
 We had been celebrating Jesus.

1166
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
 We had been sitting at that table with that other couple

1167
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,580
 talking about all the things that Jesus had done

1168
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,060
 in our lives, how he had healed us and what he had done.

1169
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,420
 So I got on a knee and I handed her a rock

1170
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,740
 because our lives were built on the rock.

1171
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,140
 And that couple that said we shouldn't be dating

1172
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,220
 a year earlier, they stood up and they applauded,

1173
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,700
 and the rest of the restaurant applauded,

1174
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,460
 and our friends and our family applauded that love.

1175
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,020
 That's what you're looking for.

1176
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,940
 That's what you want.

1177
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,420
 If you're here and you wanna be married,

1178
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,420
 inspect the five C's.

1179
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,780
 Let me pray that you would.

1180
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:18,300
 God, we know that what matters most is not the rock

1181
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:23,180
 that we exchange, but the rock our life is built on.

1182
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:30,540
 So God, would you help my friends here tonight,

1183
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,660
 even tonight, starting tonight for some of them,

1184
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,760
 build their life on the one you sent to pay for their sins.

1185
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,080
 God, would you heal the marriage that hasn't even begun?

1186
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,760
 Would you heal the hearts of husbands and wives

1187
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,000
 that haven't even met?

1188
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,800
 God, would you work to restore what the enemy

1189
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,280
 has sought to destroy?

1190
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,480
 And Father, would you help these men cherish women

1191
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,160
 to be confident in you, not conceited,

1192
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,000
 to be controlled by your Holy Spirit,

1193
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,280
 to have a clear conscience that rejoices in the truth,

1194
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,680
 not delighting in evil,

1195
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,160
 help them to be committed to the right things.

1196
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,720
 In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
