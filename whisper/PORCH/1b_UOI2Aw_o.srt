00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,600
 Mic check, I'm on. Came out, I'm not, I'm sick. And my voice is going out and I thought,

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,800
 you know, I'm going to go out there but I'm not going to sing. It didn't happen.

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,600
 1 Peter, chapter 1.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,300
 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, a God's elect, exile scattered throughout the provinces

6
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:56,400
 of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,260
 the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,300
 to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood. Grace and peace be yours in abundance. Praise

9
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:14,140
 be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In his great mercy, he has given us

10
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,520
 new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and into an

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,380
 inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:33,500
 for you who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation

13
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,860
 that is ready to be revealed in the last time.

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:44,980
 We're kicking off a new series in 1 Peter tonight. We are in the salutation. We are

15
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,740
 in the greeting. And if this was a stream that you would reach your hands deep in and

16
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:59,780
 pull them up, you would pull out gold every time. Gold is a rich, rich, rich text that

17
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,540
 I'm excited to present to you this evening. Let me pray for us.

18
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:14,780
 Father, we stand before this text knowing that you have a plan for our lives, that we

19
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,580
 are here under your providential will, that on this Tuesday we would gather in this room

20
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,740
 like this knowing that you have plans for us. And I pray that your Holy Spirit would

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:37,140
 awaken us to the truth that you have for us here in Dallas, in Fort Worth, in Houston,

22
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:46,580
 in Oklahoma, El Paso, and all over the world. Would you awaken hearts, create a revival,

23
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,380
 a great awakening? Amen.

24
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:58,740
 What do you think about when you hear the word chosen? What comes to mind? What does

25
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:06,260
 that bring about in your hearts and your mind as you hear the word that someone is chosen?

26
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,740
 What it does for me is it stirs all the insecurities of sixth grade, fifth grade, fourth grade,

27
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,540
 where you're split into team captains and everybody lines up, whether you're playing

28
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,620
 kickball or baseball or flag football or Red Rover, Red Rover, whatever the game is, right?

29
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,380
 That there's team captains, like, "Hey, I'll take you, then I'll take you." And some of

30
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,460
 you, you love this. Like, this is what you were made for because you know you were going

31
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,260
 first round, second round, draft pick. Like, you knew that you're an athlete. You're the

32
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,020
 best there is. You're out there. You're discouraged that you're not one of the captains, but you

33
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,260
 know the captain's your boy and he's about to choose you first or second, right? You

34
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,260
 know that's going to happen, right? And then others of you, you're still in counseling

35
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,580
 because of this moment. This brings back all the insecurities. You're up there and you

36
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,860
 know that everybody, one by one, slowly, like as time is standing still, is going to be

37
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,420
 chosen and divided amongst these two people until you are left standing there all alone,

38
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,860
 you and the trash can. And they have to choose between you and the trash can. And in a moment

39
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,860
 of weakness, they say, "Give me the human." That is firmly the camp that I'm in. That

40
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,860
 was the experience that I lived over and over and over again, unless they didn't know me.

41
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,900
 Because like sometimes I'd go to like the, you know, the basketball court and I could

42
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,940
 look like I could play ball. Like I'm two feet taller than everybody else and I have

43
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,460
 my Nike socks pulled up high and my Nike shorts and my Air Raids. And I was standing there

44
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,300
 and if they didn't know me, they're like, "Yo, give me the tall guy. Joke's on you,

45
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,300
 buddy. I'm bad." You know? Chosen. It can stir up that insecurity. And then it just

46
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,140
 kind of continues in life, right? Whether we're chosen for dates or chosen for a college

47
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:07,140
 or chosen for a job or an internship or chosen for marriage. And there's times and time and

48
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,180
 time again where we feel like we're not chosen. And in this rich text, I want to hit you with

49
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,060
 a theological truth that if you are here and you're going to be in heaven forever, that

50
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:29,060
 you have been chosen by God. And that if we can embrace this theological truth that we

51
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,900
 have been chosen by the creator of the heavens and the earth, all of those things I just

52
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,900
 listed fail into the background, fade into the background, they are not important. And

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,700
 you think, "How can that be? Not getting married is not important. How can that possibly be?

54
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:54,300
 Not getting a job? I mean, those are natural. How could that not be important?" But if we

55
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,300
 can grasp this evening the reality that you've been chosen by God, that that would fade into

56
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,260
 the backdrop. Here in 1 Peter, I've had conversations with some of you that really struggle with

57
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:16,260
 this idea that God would choose some and not others. And I think if we dig back, it comes

58
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,180
 down to a place where you say, "Well, that's not fair. It's not fair that God would do

59
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:27,180
 that. He'd choose some and I just, it's not fair." And I'm here to tell you, it's not

60
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:34,380
 fair. God's not fair. If God was fair, he'd choose no one. It's so much better than fair

61
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:47,820
 that God would invite you into the riches of his abundance, grace, eternal riches forever

62
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,740
 and ever and ever, an inheritance that you could never, ever deserve and yet he extends

63
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,740
 it to you freely. It's not fair. And so we need this book that Peter wrote. And why did

64
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:13,020
 he write it? About 64, 63, 64 AD, the church is facing extreme persecution. It is on the

65
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:20,620
 rise. The emperor is Nero and Nero is like that crazy fraternity brother that you had

66
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,580
 or that you knew of. He's that guy that always takes things a little too far, always gets

67
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,100
 a little too drunk and he's like, "Let's get in a fight. Let's go streaking. Let's burn

68
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,500
 down Rome." That's Nero. He's a crazy madman. He is a lunatic. You're like, he's either

69
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,700
 going to be in a circus or in prison or run for president. And we all hope it's not the

70
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,700
 third one, but it might be all three somehow. That's Nero. And so just to tell you, he killed

71
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,500
 his mom because she objected to his sexual affairs. After his wife died, he married his

72
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 male servant, had him castrated because his servant resembled his wife. He set Rome on

73
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,360
 fire and historians say that he walked through the palace and played the fiddle as it burned

74
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,780
 to the ground. And then he brought Christians forward and tortured them until they confessed

75
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,140
 to burning down Rome so that people would hate them because he took all of his angst

76
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,740
 and he targeted this group called the way, this group called Christians that he would

77
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,660
 later take them, dip them in wax and light them on fire on the side of the road to give

78
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,120
 light. He's a lunatic. And when you cannot trust the leader that is over you and you

79
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,820
 feel oppressed by that leader, you need hope. And so Peter, at just the right moment in

80
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,820
 history, pinned this letter from Rome to give the scattered church hope. And so this evening,

81
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,820
 as we move through it, we're looking at how you have been chosen to be obedient, how you

82
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,820
 have been chosen to be made to be born again, and how you've been chosen to receive an inheritance.

83
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:05,100
 Peter, an apostle of Christ Jesus to the elect, this doctrine of elect, it's not hidden in

84
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,440
 this text. It's right there off the bat. He's showing you the doctrine of election right

85
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,260
 off the bat. He's not afraid of it. It's very matter of factly. To the exile scattered throughout

86
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,340
 the provinces of Pontius, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. I can show you on a map.

87
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,900
 This is modern day Turkey, almost exactly modern day Turkey. And the church is scattered

88
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,620
 through this so that we would read it thousands of years later and be encouraged. Who have

89
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,420
 been chosen, underline that word chosen. According to the foreknowledge of God, the father, this

90
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,540
 word foreknowledge here, it's the word prognosis. In the Greek, it's the word prognosis. It's

91
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,020
 where we get the exact word in the English, prognosis, the results of something. Prognosis,

92
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:59,340
 it's the result. Right? And so God's foreknowledge is not that, and this is important, it's not

93
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,480
 that he looks ahead and sees the future. It's that he made the future, that he knows the

94
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 future intimately. It's like this. I know that tomorrow's Wednesday. God has ordained

95
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,580
 every event of Wednesday in his foreknowledge. He knows Wednesday, every second of Wednesday.

96
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:29,880
 Through the sanctifying work of the spirit to be obedient, underline that, to be obedient

97
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,620
 to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood. So this very first sentence alludes to the

98
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,620
 doctrine of election, the doctrine of predestination, the doctrine of sanctification, the doctrine

99
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,580
 of the foreknowledge of God and the Trinity, father, son, and spirit, working together

100
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:49,580
 to choose you. Do you see what I mean by such a rich text? Grace and peace be yours in abundance.

101
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,980
 My first point this evening is that you've been chosen to be made obedient. That you

102
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,340
 have been chosen to be made obedient. Who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge

103
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,460
 of God, the father through the sanctifying work chosen for what chosen to be obedient

104
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:11,360
 to Jesus Christ, that you have a new Lord Jesus, that you do not go through life doing

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,500
 whatever you want to do. This is my friends. This is the single most distinguishing characteristic

106
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 of the Christian that you no longer do what you want to do. And there are things that

107
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:34,260
 you don't want to do that you do. That you no longer do what you naturally want to do.

108
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:42,380
 And you do things that you don't naturally want to do. We hold our money loosely, we

109
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,460
 give it away, we care for the poor, we don't just follow our sexual urges. This is the

110
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:54,460
 mark of the follower of Christ, the one who has been chosen. And we do these things willingly

111
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:01,740
 and voluntarily with the help of the spirit, by the spirit's work. God has changed us

112
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,140
 and given us a new master. This concept right here, friends, this is what God used to save

113
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,860
 me. And I've told you this story before, but I want to teach through it for just a moment.

114
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,820
 So let me tell you the story and then I'll teach through it. I stumbled into this place,

115
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,500
 hung over, sat in the back row, wearing the clothes from the night before, from the club,

116
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,620
 and I began to wrestle with this idea, who is God? Always said that I believed in God,

117
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,100
 never made a decision that was impacted by my belief in God. So it was like, I believe

118
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,980
 in God, but I'm going to get drunk and I'm going to have sex and I'm going to have fun

119
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,860
 and I'm going to party and I'm going to do whatever I want to do. But I believe in God.

120
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,740
 It was a statement of belief, not an act of belief. Behavior always follows our belief,

121
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,820
 right? And so there I am, I'm in the back row, and the guy tells this goofy story, dumb

122
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,220
 story, God used it to save my life, about a horse, a wild stallion. The horse just wanted

123
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,340
 to be free, roam the mountaintops in this pursuit of freedom until, you know, people

124
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,740
 would try to capture it, but it just wanted to be free. So one day a farmer, villager,

125
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,300
 local cowboy successfully captured the horse, put a rope around his neck and took him home

126
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,880
 and loved him, cared for him, provided for him and eventually broke him and was able

127
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,180
 to ride him. And when he would ride this horse, he would lead him to food, he would lead him

128
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,980
 to water and he would provide shelter for him. And the line that God used to save me

129
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,220
 was the horse wasn't completely free until he was fully submissive to his master. Now

130
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,060
 I came in, my life looked like I had it together, you know, I worked in a high rise building,

131
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,020
 wore a suit every day, had the Jaguar S-type that I'd take to work and lived in the condo

132
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,740
 in uptown. But I wanted to be free. All of those things were the pursuit of freedom for

133
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,020
 me. Now let me retell that story. I want you to look at verse two closely. When the rope

134
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,220
 was placed around that horse's neck, he was chosen according to the foreknowledge of God

135
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:05,740
 the Father. When he was being broken, this is through the sanctifying work of the Spirit.

136
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:12,300
 And when he found true freedom, he was obedient to Jesus Christ. And you say, "How can true

137
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:19,020
 freedom come from obedience?" Because he is the only master that can truly lead you to

138
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,380
 freedom. You cannot find freedom on your own. You cannot find freedom in the world. And

139
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,580
 let me illustrate this. Let me give you a paradox. Two very different people. Let's

140
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:36,980
 take the homeless beggar on the corner and the billionaire in the corner office, in the

141
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:46,740
 estate with acreage and employees. And both of them, and it's a broad stereotype statement

142
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:55,160
 I realize, both of them are in their situation, according to my illustration, because of their

143
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,860
 pursuit of freedom. This man wants the freedom from authority, the freedom from rules, the

144
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,700
 freedom from anyone telling him what to do, so much so that he's found the freedom from

145
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:16,340
 the existence of a house and bills and the man. And this guy believes that his riches,

146
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,900
 collecting riches, piling riches, having so much that he can do whatever he wants to do

147
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,260
 is the path to freedom. That's what some of you believe here tonight. You think, "Hey,

148
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,820
 I'm going to go. I'm going to try to become a millionaire before I'm 30 or maybe now before

149
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:36,020
 I'm 40, or a billionaire, so that I can do whatever I want." You were not made to do

150
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:43,700
 whatever you want. You were made to do what God wants. And God did not choose you based

151
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,540
 on your ability. He chose you based on what he can do through you. The eyes of the Lord

152
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,820
 go to and fro, looking for hearts that are fully his. What does the Lord want? A humble

153
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:02,220
 and contrite spirit. He did not choose you, write it down, he did not choose you based

154
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:09,860
 on what you can do, but based on what he can do through you. Romans 10, 9, "If you declare

155
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,460
 with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' you have a new Lord. And believe in your heart that

156
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,780
 God has the power to raise him from the dead, you will be saved." And so obedience, this

157
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,700
 obedience is believing that Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are leading you, that you

158
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,500
 are protected by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, verse 2, and you are shielded by God's

159
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,780
 power until the coming age, that's coming in just a minute in verse 5. And God is helping

160
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:46,860
 you in your obedience. What happens when you do something wrong, believer? You're convicted.

161
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,220
 You get in your car and that quiet voice says, "You shouldn't have done that." It's conviction,

162
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,100
 it's not guilt for the believer, it's conviction. "You shouldn't have done that, you shouldn't

163
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,580
 have went there with him. You shouldn't have went there with them, you shouldn't have drank

164
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,420
 that much. You shouldn't have looked at that, you shouldn't have gone back to that website,

165
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,460
 you shouldn't have pulled it up on your phone, you shouldn't have done that, you shouldn't

166
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:18,860
 have called them back, you shouldn't have called them." That's God helping you. And

167
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,740
 if it's not there, if you say, "No, I'm going to continue to sleep with my significant other

168
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:31,500
 and I don't feel bad about it. I think God's given me the freedom. Oh, now we're in dangerous

169
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:43,060
 ground. I don't feel bad about it. The Holy Spirit isn't helping me." You may not be a

170
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:57,380
 believer. You may not have realized God's choosing. If it's not happening, then that

171
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:06,940
 is concerning. Second point from this text. "You've been chosen to be born into a living

172
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:15,060
 hope." Verse 3, "Praise be to God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In his great mercy

173
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,920
 he has given us new birth," underline this, "new birth into a living hope through the

174
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,340
 resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." A new birth means a new family. That you have

175
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,740
 a new family. That you have a new life. That this is the way the scriptures describe it.

176
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,820
 That you have a new birth into a living hope. Let me describe. Let me explain. I sat in

177
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:47,180
 Algebra 2 behind Kayla. You guys don't know Kayla, but Kayla was the most perfect individual

178
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,780
 I had ever met at the time. She was born into a family with a lot of money. She had the

179
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:59,540
 cool mom. The mom that would take her to wrap houses or do whatever. The cool mom. That

180
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:09,300
 was her mom. She was always smiling. She was more beautiful than any human being should

181
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:18,860
 be. She smelled like cotton candy. I would sit behind her in Algebra 2 and I would think,

182
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:27,620
 "What does this girl have to do in life? She's got to get up and eat and go back to

183
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,960
 sleep at some point. That's it. That's what she needs to do. All of the world is going

184
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,860
 to give her whatever she wants for the rest of the rest. She's going to be the cheerleader

185
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:45,780
 and get the job and in the interview. Everybody loves her. The most popular, she's Kayla.

186
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:58,260
 She's got everything coming her way except she's going to die. And then what? It doesn't

187
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:07,940
 matter what family she was born into then or how perfectly symmetrical her eyes were.

188
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:13,260
 How perfect her hair always was. God doesn't care that she smells like cotton candy. He

189
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:22,100
 made her that way. It's not a shoe into heaven unless she has been received a new birth into

190
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,620
 the living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. That first birth doesn't matter.

191
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:39,820
 That gets you 80 years maybe if you're lucky. Lucky, God's providence. I don't know. She's

192
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,340
 got to be born again. That's what Jesus said. Peter knew this because Jesus taught this

193
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,620
 in John chapter 3. It's the only two places in the New Testament it shows up. Nicodemus

194
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,020
 asked Jesus, "What do you mean born again?" He says, "You must be born of both water,"

195
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,260
 that's a natural birth, "and of the Spirit," that's salvation, "that you must be born again."

196
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,180
 And Peter lived it because you remember Peter was a fisherman. Jesus comes up to him and

197
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:07,500
 says, "Put down your nets. You're going to be a fisher of men. Follow me." And then we

198
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,740
 see Peter and he constantly is messing everything up, constantly putting his foot in his mouth,

199
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,180
 constantly just messing things up. And then even to the point of denying Jesus, he's such

200
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,820
 a coward. He doesn't even say that, "Hey, that's my best friend," because he's nervous

201
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,100
 about this 12-year-old girl and whatever's going to happen to him. And so he denies Jesus.

202
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,460
 And then Jesus shows back up on the scene and says, "Do you love me, Peter? Or did you

203
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:40,100
 know I love you? Feed my sheep." And Peter, that's not who you are. You're a new creation.

204
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:47,340
 See, God doesn't make you different. He makes you new. God didn't bring you here tonight

205
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,340
 to make you different. He desires to make you new. God didn't come into your life and

206
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,480
 flood your life and flood your relationships and flood every aspect of who you are to make

207
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:08,100
 you different. He's making you His. He's making you new. He has plans for you, plans to prosper

208
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:14,020
 you. He's created you. You're His masterpiece to walk through the good works, which He's

209
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:21,040
 created for you to walk in, Ephesians 2.10. A plan and a purpose for you to do something

210
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:31,000
 incredible through you. And anyone here who is currently headed toward heaven has been

211
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,980
 born again. And this second birth gives you the hope of eternal life.

212
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,760
 I was here for the services on Sunday, and I was rather discouraged. I'd been sick for

213
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,620
 about three and a half weeks, and I was just fighting discouragement. And I was up here

214
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:56,380
 after the service meeting with people, and this sweet little nine-year-old girl walks

215
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:03,980
 up with her dad. And she -- her dad starts and says, "She would like you to pray for

216
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,420
 her mom. She just -- she came out of kids' ministry today and said, 'I want the pastor

217
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:14,020
 to pray for me.' Her mom has breast cancer, just had a double mastectomy, and is about

218
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,540
 to go into the final stages of chemo. Would you just pray for her healing, pray that she

219
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,820
 would live?" I told her -- I mean, I told her it would be my greatest honor and privilege

220
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,420
 of the week to pray for this sweet little girl. She was so sweet to smile and just kind

221
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:42,100
 as can be. And I got to tell her, you know, my mother had cancer as well, same kind of

222
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:48,860
 cancer, same kind of surgery, same kind of chemo. She's still with me. And I got to share

223
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:55,620
 with her that hope, but that's -- that's a fleeting hope. I said, "Let me ask you a question.

224
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:06,260
 Is your mom a believer?" She said, "Yes, my mommy loves Jesus." Oh. Oh, your mommy's going

225
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:13,460
 to live forever. I cannot see what happens in the midst of the cancer and the chemo,

226
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:21,820
 but your mommy's going to live forever. She has an eternal hope that changes everything.

227
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,100
 This life is just a tiny glimpse. It's a commercial, and then there's forever. And you cannot live

228
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,860
 this life for this life because it makes it look like you don't believe in the forever.

229
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,140
 If you just live this life for this life, it's like you don't really think there's a

230
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:40,580
 forever. And she's going to live forever. Your mommy has been chosen to walk in obedience

231
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,180
 as she suffers. She's been chosen to be born again, to endure this suffering different

232
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,340
 than someone who is in this world and suffers without hope. And your mommy has been chosen

233
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:02,900
 to receive an inheritance. Let's talk about that. Third point, chosen to receive an inheritance.

234
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:11,300
 "Chosen to receive an inheritance." "And into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil,

235
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,060
 or fade," Peter writes. This is an alliteration in the Greek. "And into an inheritance that

236
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,900
 can never perish, spoil, or fade." This inheritance, it's not like they bought stock in WorldCom

237
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,820
 or something. It's secure. It's not going to depreciate. It's going to last forever.

238
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,300
 This inheritance is kept in heaven for you. "Who through faith," this is you talking about,

239
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:38,460
 "Who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is

240
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:46,740
 ready to be revealed in the last time." Friends, what problem on earth is not solved by an

241
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,300
 eternal inheritance? Inheritance is a word that Peter's audience would have known well

242
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,100
 because in this day, you would choose your heir. So like Nero, for example, was chosen

243
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:05,740
 by his uncle, not his dad, his uncle to be the heir to the throne, to receive that inheritance.

244
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,140
 You would choose somebody, not necessarily even a family member. Like you'd go out and

245
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,460
 find someone who you thought would take care of your riches and you would choose them.

246
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,780
 God, the creator of the heavens and the earth, who owns a cattle on a thousand hills and

247
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:26,060
 every piece of gold he created and everything he owns, and he says, "Who am I going to entrust

248
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,940
 it to?" and he chooses you. And it feels not intimate because you're like, "Well, he chooses

249
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:41,580
 me and all the other Christians." There's enough to go around. Eternal riches. You will

250
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,140
 not go for naught. You will not feel like you didn't receive your part or enough. I'm

251
00:26:48,140 --> 00:27:03,420
 certain he makes you an heir. So imagine you came in tonight and you're like, "Oh, my job.

252
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:14,540
 My car. Got the check engine lights always on. My apartment. It's too small and too expensive.

253
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:26,860
 Not to mention my roommates. That's not nice. My bank account. All my problems would be

254
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,420
 solved if I was rich and I didn't have to worry about these things. And if I get sick

255
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,860
 while I'm at it, how about I take health too? I'd be healthy all the time." And let's just

256
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:46,300
 say you came in here and I was able to give you that. Let's just say everyone here received

257
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,020
 millions of dollars. We made national news. Everyone at the porch left a millionaire. Don't

258
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,820
 move. It's not going to happen, right? But let's just say, don't rush the stage, everyone

259
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:03,380
 leaves a millionaire. It's a life-changing event. For the rest of your life, you'd remember

260
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,340
 this day. You'd tell everyone about this day. They'd come and visit you at your estate and

261
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,740
 be greeted by your butler and come in and you'd be like, "Yeah, the porch, man, they're

262
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:24,180
 just handing out money. It was great. Making it rain." How is this not better than that?

263
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:32,580
 We just don't believe it. This is so much more life-changing than that event that might

264
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,100
 last you another 50 years. This is so much more life-changing. This is an eternal, which

265
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,220
 is so much more than a measly million dollars. We just don't believe this text. We look at

266
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,140
 it and we say, "God, you're lying. We do not believe it. We don't allow it to penetrate

267
00:28:50,140 --> 00:29:02,980
 our hearts. It will not change our tomorrow unless the Spirit buys grace." "Who through

268
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:13,180
 faith," verse 5, "you through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation

269
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:20,740
 that is ready to be revealed in the last time." Underline "shielded by God's power" because

270
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:28,500
 that's pretty awesome. You're an heir. When I was in the corporate world, I had this customer

271
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,140
 in Mexico, based out of Mexico, owned a billion-dollar company in Mexico. When he would take his

272
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:40,740
 children to work, he would take them to work by way of helicopter with Navy SEALs as their

273
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,340
 guards because they were a kidnapping risk. Someone wanted to take them and hold them

274
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,060
 as ransom. Because they were valuable and because their inheritance was valuable, they

275
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:59,420
 were well-protected. You're valuable, your inheritance is eternal, and you're shielded

276
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:06,900
 by God's power. I was thinking about this this week, and so I looked up the most heavily

277
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,700
 guarded places, places like prisons with high walls and fences and lots of guards. There's

278
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,700
 this weird seed vault in Antarctica. I'll look it up later, but it's pretty crazy. Places

279
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:25,100
 like Fort Knox in Fort Knox, Kentucky, where the U.S. stores most of their gold, over 5,000

280
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:32,460
 tons. This gold sits behind a 22-ton vault door. The vault uses a combination that has

281
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:39,460
 to be entered by at least 10 different staff members who each have their own code. There's

282
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:44,620
 concrete-lined granite walls, alarms surrounding the entire facility. There's Army tanks outside

283
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,620
 the building, fences and guards, and an Apache helicopter that flies over. It is a well-guarded

284
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:57,020
 facility. And as I looked up the most well-guarded facilities in the world, I saw places like

285
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:04,940
 Fort Knox. But they missed the most well-guarded facility in the world. They missed it. Google

286
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:14,420
 missed it. Let me show it to you. That's it. That's it. And wherever you're at right now,

287
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:20,060
 wherever you're listening, I showed a picture of the church. It's God's people shielded

288
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:28,380
 by God's power that nothing is going to happen to you one second before God's providential

289
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:39,260
 ordained will. You will not die. You are eternal. You are immortal until God is done with you.

290
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:47,980
 You can leave those doors and you can face any persecution with a smile, any challenge

291
00:31:47,980 --> 00:32:00,820
 with hope, any moment of discouragement reflecting on your eternal inheritance that will not

292
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:19,340
 fade or perish or spoil. So in summary, you've been chosen to be made obedient, chosen to

293
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:32,740
 be born again into a living hope, and chosen to receive an inheritance. I also read this

294
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:41,460
 story this week about a man named Thomas Martinez in Bolivia. Thomas was a beggar on the streets,

295
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:48,620
 67 years old. True story. And he would stand on the corner and beg for change. He'd take

296
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,260
 the change into the local bar. He had an alcohol problem. He would spend the money that he

297
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:00,120
 collected on drugs and alcohol. And when he didn't collect enough money, he had been known

298
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:08,260
 to write fake checks, hot checks. So he'd write these checks to fund his drug and alcohol

299
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,940
 problem. And this was well known. This kind of spread throughout the community. And Thomas

300
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:22,060
 is there in a bar, his favorite bar in Bolivia, when the police come in. And they're asking

301
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,100
 around. He catches word that they're looking for him. And so he leaves out the back door,

302
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:36,660
 never to be seen again. The police were looking for him because he had received a $6 million

303
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:44,260
 inheritance. Forty years earlier, he was married to a woman and he left her, but they never

304
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,620
 divorced. After they were married, she received a large inheritance and then she passed away.

305
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,340
 And this inheritance was left to Thomas. He's on the street, but he has no idea that he's

306
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:05,420
 a millionaire. And so as someone comes to give him this gift, he flees. Afraid of what

307
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,660
 they might ask of him, afraid of the changes that they might enforce upon him. Not understanding

308
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,860
 that he's been chosen to receive an inheritance. He runs. And I think of so many of you here

309
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,740
 tonight, terrified that God's going to ask you to break up with them or not date them

310
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:30,340
 or move or, or change jobs or dress different or hang out with different people, different

311
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:38,700
 places. And it's time because you're here. You can wrestle with whatever I chose and

312
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,380
 consider where you're at on a Tuesday night. What you're listening to that God and his

313
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:51,680
 mercy would give you this message. And do not sneak out the back door because what he

314
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:57,540
 is asking of you is only to give you life. God does not ask anything of you that is not

315
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:03,460
 for your Supreme best. Nothing. There is nothing, no matter how hard, no matter how tall of

316
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:10,060
 an order that God would ask of you. That is not for your absolute best. He's not trying

317
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:19,240
 to rip you off. He desires to set you free. He desires to invite you in to his incredible

318
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:31,140
 riches. You've been chosen. He chooses you. He's chosen you out of your habits. Some of

319
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:38,740
 you out of your relationship. And some of you out of your struggles. Some of you he's

320
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,980
 chosen out of your idols. Some of you he's chosen out of your families. He's chosen you

321
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:53,660
 out of your past. Through the blood of Jesus Christ who's died for your sins, by the same

322
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:59,480
 spirit that raised him from the dead, that spirit now seeks to help you through this

323
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:09,020
 life shielding you by God's power to the finish line. To the eternal riches. That's the truth.

324
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:22,640
 Let me pray we believe it. Father, thank you for your servant Peter. For the truth that

325
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:36,340
 you have for us just through the greetings of this great text. Father, would you awaken

326
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:43,740
 our hearts all over this country and all over this world. Would you awaken the hearts of

327
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,600
 young adults of 20s and 30s somethings everywhere that they would trade in the American dreams

328
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,540
 that they would trade in their hope and the things that they're holding on to and their

329
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,940
 trinkets and their treasures and they would make this incredible great exchange for this

330
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,300
 eternal inheritance that they would see you as a Duffcott and that they would live every

331
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,620
 waking moment of their life for you and when they lay down to sleep you say you give to

332
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:12,660
 your children even as they sleep that you would give to them Lord. That your spirit

333
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:20,140
 would conform their lives to something better than anything this world could offer them.

334
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,580
 That they would live for Jesus, King Jesus. That Jesus would be their Lord. That Jesus

335
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:36,460
 would be their master. Jesus become our master. No longer slaves to this world but that we

336
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:45,220
 would be slaves to righteousness. In Jesus name, Amen. No longer slaves to this world

337
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:52,060
 but that we would be slaves to righteousness. In Jesus name, Amen.
