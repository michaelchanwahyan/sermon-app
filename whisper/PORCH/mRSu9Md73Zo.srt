00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Well, how we doing, Ports? Come on.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey, would you help me welcome all of our PortsLive locations around the nation.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Fort Worth, Midland, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Greater Lafayette, Dayton, Scottsdale, Boise, Fresno.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And for the very first time, I'm coming at you, the PortsLive Wheaton, Illinois. Let's go.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey, if you have a copy of God's Word, I hope you do, you can find the book of Hebrews.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm a coffee drinker, so Hebrews is my favorite book of the Bible.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Come on, somebody. That's poor.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Hey, man, that's a bad dad joke right there. But thank you for entertaining me with that laugh.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Hebrews, chapter 12 is where we'll be tonight.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Hey, before we get going, anybody watch the Olympics?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Yeah, dude, I love the Olympics. Like I'm all in, Team USA.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Like I keep the ESPN up on my browser, like as I'm checking it nonstop.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Like I'm like, hey, are we on top still? Is Team USA on top?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And you know, we're going back and forth with China with the gold and we end up tying them, boo.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But whatever, they're pretty good.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 But one thing I love about the Olympics is the men's 4x100 relay.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Anybody? Okay. Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So I love the men's 4x100 relay. It's one of my favorite events.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And man, the reason why I love it, it's like technical and, you know, people are getting DQ'd all the time.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And, you know, it's just a lot, lots going on in the men's 4x100 relay.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And I don't know if you saw this a few years back, but the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, the men's 4x100 relay,

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 they were heavily favored to win the gold.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Like it was like the dream team.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 They had three out of the 10 fastest men in all the world on one team.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And people thought they were just going to take gold and no problem.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And that year they did not even get gold and they failed to qualify.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Because in a relay race, it's not really how fast the runner is.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 In a relay race, it comes down to what they call the exchange zone.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 The exchange zone is 1.9 meters or 1.9 seconds, 20 meters.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And it's what happens in the exchange zone that will make or break the race.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And so in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, this is what happened right here.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Like Odoo reaches back and chokeslams his partner.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Like that's it.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And they not only didn't get gold that year, they failed to even qualify.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So I'm like 2024 is our year.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Like this is it.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Like no holding back.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 We're going all in.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Paris.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 That's when we're going to take the gold.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And the same thing or like it happened.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Check out this picture.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 The dude grabs Kun-Fu Kenny's arm and tries to slow him down.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And so they didn't even get gold.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I mean, they failed to even qualify.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Because everything that will make or break that race happens in the exchange zone.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And so I'm like, okay, where are you going with this Josiah?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 This is where I'm going.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I share that with you tonight because in a relay race, it doesn't matter if you have the fastest runners.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 What matters is did you pass the baton.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Hebrews chapter 12, as we open up God's word, is going to tell us that our job as Christians is to pass the baton.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Like you're like, well, what's the baton?

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 The baton is our faith in Jesus Christ.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And what Hebrews is going to say tonight is that if you're a believer, if you're a follower of Jesus,

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 then our job is to pass the baton of our faith from one person to the next.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Hebrews chapter 12.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 [Reading from book]

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Side note.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Do you know what the joy that was set before him was?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 You.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 That the saints are "glorious riches of the inheritance of Christ."

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And so when he was standing in front of Galgotha looking at the bloody, horrible death that he was going to endure for you and I,

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 he said, hey, what would make it worth it to endure that death?

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 To endure that pain?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Part of the answer was you.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 By paying the price of our sins through his death on the cross so that we would be free from the penalty of sin and get eternity with him.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 We were the joy that was set before him.

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Now Hebrews 12 starts with the word "therefore."

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And if you've been around Bible teaching for any time, you know that any time you see the word "therefore," you have to work backwards and you have to ask what the "therefore" was there for.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So in Hebrews 11, it's one of the most famous chapters in all the Bible.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Because in Hebrews 11, it's what we call the Hall of Faith, where you get 16 consecutive stories about men and women going all the way back to Genesis,

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 stretching forward to Hebrews about men and women who took the baton of their faith and passed it to the people around them and to the next generation.

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Which should serve as a reminder of you and I, if you're a believer in the room tonight, that we should do the same.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Now think about this, Porch.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 God looked at everyone who would ever exist everywhere and plucked them out of eternity.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 He then positioned you in time, has proportioned your gifts, and he's given you resources, and he's planted you right here at the porch.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And God's given us the responsibility to pass the baton of our faith to our generation.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 You ask, "What's my purpose in life?"

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Listen to me.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 This is our purpose.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Paul, the apostle Paul who wrote two-thirds in the New Testament, he understood his purpose, which has become my life verse.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Acts 20, 24 just says this, "But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned to me by my Lord Jesus."

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 What's that work, Paul?

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 The work of telling others the good news about his wonderful grace.

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Passing the baton of our faith to the people around us.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 I've been at the porch for five years now, and each week, without fail, I have a front-row seat to watch young adults fall down the aisles of this place because they saw Jesus, and they now want to surrender their life to him.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And can I tell you something?

89
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 It never gets old.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 It's amazing.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I mean, I don't want to give my life to anything else but that.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And so tonight, I want to give us five lessons that I've learned over the five years here at the porch that has helped us pass the baton of our faith to those around us.

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Certainly not an exhaustive list, but it's helpful, I think.

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Lessons that I've learned from much wiser people that I'm stealing from them and giving to you tonight.

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Passing the baton of our faith.

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Lesson 1 starts with this.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Learning how to pray and abide.

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Pray and abide.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Mark 1.35.

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 This is Jesus rising very early in the morning while it was still dark, departed and went out to a desolate place and there he prayed.

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 There's four verbs in this one verse.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Do you see it?

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Rising very early.

104
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And the day even starts, he's getting up and spending time with the father.

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Departed, number 2.

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 So he went somewhere.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Went is number 3.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Like he actually did it.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 He didn't just depart and get in his car and sit there and scroll on Instagram.

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 No, he literally went somewhere and it says he went to a desolate place.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 This word desolate means without people.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Without distractions.

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And there he prayed.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Why would Jesus do this?

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Because he believed prayer works.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 You think one of the first things I believe we're going to see when we get to heaven is this.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 That prayer really worked.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Like prayer really worked.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Like everything is going to come clear and you're going to stand before Jesus and you're going to be like, man, that thing I was doing from time to time, man, it really worked.

120
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And my heart with his heart and my thoughts with his thoughts and my actions with his actions.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He was beginning to align those things to him.

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Like we're going to get up there and we're going to say, wow, man, you were really listening to me.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Talking to you was really doing something.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Jesus says this in John 15, 5, that apart from me you can do nothing.

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 He's inviting us into a life of dependence on him.

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Let me read it.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I'm the vine, you're the branches.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 For apart from me you can do nothing.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Like Jesus is telling us that he's the vine.

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 He's the source of life.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 If you're praying or lack thereof, if you're not praying, that you're quietly confident that money, time, and your stuff is all you need in life.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Like that's what we're communicating to God.

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 If we're not praying, then we're quietly confident that God, that's all we really need.

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 If you want to know how dependent you are, there's a simple test I can give you.

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Ask this question.

137
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 How much have you prayed today?

138
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Like this simple question will reflect on whether you were dependent with a lot of time that God is giving you today.

139
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And some of you sitting there right now and you're just saying, well, I didn't really pray a whole lot today.

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Some of you are thinking, wow, since the moment I woke up until I came into this place, I haven't prayed.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I would just tell you that you're probably not dependent on God.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 God is telling us that we don't have the resources to do life the way he intended us to.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Simply the most dangerous thing that you and I can do today is pray and abide.

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Why?

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Because prayer affects what you expect.

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Prayer affects what you expect.

147
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 For example, if you expect to get married someday, then praying will begin to affect that area of your life.

148
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Praying for a spouse every day just makes sense.

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Not just praying that you would meet him or her, but praying that when you meet him or her,

150
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 that there would just be this connection where God is affirming that this person is the person that you should marry.

151
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I have a good friend.

152
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 She's also on staff.

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 You saw her up here earlier, Grace Ball.

154
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Love this girl.

155
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 She's amazing.

156
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 She did ministry with me in Kansas City.

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 She's now here in Dallas on staff here at the porch.

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 She sent me her prayer list.

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I asked for it.

160
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 I said, hey, can I share your prayer list?

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 She expected to get married someday.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I'm like, I want to see what's on that list.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So here it is.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Here's what's on that list.

165
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Check it out.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Don't worry, I got approval.

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Look at this.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I want a guy who's close to his family.

169
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Family, country, music.

170
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 That sounds like a preference.

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Heart for high school, young adults, wants to go overseas, loves dogs, preference, competitive, funny,

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 connection to Nashville, not sure what's going on there.

173
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Dimpled?

174
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Okay.

175
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Would impact my family's faith and joy to our lives, could handle my mom's battle.

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Like really serious stuff.

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Our missions, gifts would align, peace from the beginning, excited, and joy from family.

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I mean, that's a pretty good list, right?

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 You can clap it up and give it up for that.

180
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And so why do I share that with you tonight?

181
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Well, it's going to be on my Insta stories after the message if any of you bachelors fit the categories, right?

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 No, that's not why.

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 The reason why I share that with you tonight is because Jesus said you could pray for whatever you want.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You know that?

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 John 14.

186
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Verse 13, here's what he says.

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And I will do whatever you ask in my name so that the father may be glorified in the son.

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 You may ask me for anything in my name and I will do it.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Six different times Jesus says ask and it will be given to you.

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But many of us don't believe this because we tried and we didn't get what our -- we didn't really get what we wanted.

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And so I would say, hey, the problem isn't your prayer.

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 The problem is maybe the lack of praying, the continual praying and abiding that you have done with the Lord.

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Because here's what I know.

194
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 You can ask God for whatever you want because he already knows.

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Like some of you are trying to Jesus juke God and say I don't need a spouse.

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 But deep down you want a spouse and you want him to see you as satisfied.

197
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 You are like you are not juking God.

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 You are not going to win there.

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So just pray for a spouse.

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 But you can ask God for whatever you want.

201
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Here's the kicker.

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Ask him for what he wants.

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Like you can -- hey, God, I want this but more than anything that I want, I want what you want, God.

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 I want to do your will for my life, God.

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And as you begin to pray that prayer, guess what God begins to do?

206
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 He begins to align our heart with his, our request with his request.

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Say something, God, would you show me what you want?

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And would you give me a greater desire in my heart for what you want than what I want?

209
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And if I don't want what you want, God, help me not to want it.

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Man, this was all too real.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 I found myself in my mid-20s.

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Still single.

213
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I don't think I had gone on a date in like three years.

214
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Holler, anybody in the room?

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Okay.

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And I was just getting depressed, man.

217
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And so I was single and lonely.

218
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And I remember crying out to God, just talking to him.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Hey, God, you know your brother has got needs, like sexual needs.

220
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Yeah, it just got real.

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And so, you know, during that time, man, I was just struggling every once in a while with porn and masturbation.

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 There I said it.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And I remember God, as I was going to him with complete honesty and transparency,

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I remember him showing me that my greatest need wasn't to get a girlfriend to fix my loneliness,

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 wasn't to get a wife to satisfy my sexual desires.

226
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 The greatest need that God began to show me in that season was more of him.

227
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 So that he could be my satisfaction.

228
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 You see, I think sometimes we shortchange prayer, and we sometimes use it to get more from God instead of getting more of God.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That's the whole point of prayer, is that we would go to him and not necessarily just ask him for what we want.

230
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 You know, you saw grace.

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Like, where's grace?

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Where's grace?

233
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Yeah, there you are.

234
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 You saw grace asking God for what she wanted, you know what I'm saying?

235
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 If he didn't give you a man that was dimpled, you'd be okay, right?

236
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Okay.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 If he didn't give you a man at all, would you be okay?

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Okay, yeah, but she just threw up her ring because she just got engaged.

239
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Sorry, fellas.

240
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Ah!

241
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But I know this woman.

242
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 She has been content and satisfied with God.

243
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But there's a tension that we can manage with God.

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Like, God wants you to bring your request to him.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But ultimately, he wants to give you more of himself.

246
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And as he does, he begins to show you that he's enough.

247
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 That he's enough.

248
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 The Lord is my shepherd.

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 I shall not -- come on -- want.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I have everything I need.

251
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I have everything I need in him.

252
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 So hard to walk out, easier to say.

253
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 But I know that passing the baton of our faith happens when we

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 see our need to pray and abide.

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Lesson 2, obstacles are opportunities for my good and

256
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 his glory.

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Obstacles are opportunities for my good and his glory.

258
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 What I love about the book of Ecclesiastes is it sums it up

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 perfectly in Ecclesiastes 3.

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Here's what it says in verse 1.

261
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 There is a time for everything, a season for every activity under

262
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 the heavens, a time to be born and a time to die.

263
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So a person's birthday and his funeral.

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 A time to plant and a time to uproot.

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I'm not a person but with plants.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 105 degrees here in Texas, I uprooted all of my roses.

267
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 They are getting crushed.

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I did that this past weekend, it was awesome.

269
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 A time to kill and a time to heal and a time to tear down and

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 a time to build and a time to weep and a time to laugh and a

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 time to mourn and a time to dance.

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Isn't this the entire human experience summed up in a few

273
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 verses?

274
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 There is a time for everything Solomon is saying.

275
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's in control of the good times and the bad.

276
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Everyone will laugh and cry and mourn and dance and everyone

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 will be born and everyone will die.

278
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 No one gets to avoid the obstacles and the pain of life.

279
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Why?

280
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Because this isn't the world we had.

281
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Genesis 1 and 2, man, paradise, perfection.

282
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 But this is the world that we have.

283
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Genesis 3, sin, suffering and death.

284
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 But listen to me, this isn't the world that we will have.

285
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Like I read the rest of the book.

286
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 If you go to Revelation 21, he says it.

287
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Paradise lost in the garden, perfection will be paradise

288
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 regained someday.

289
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Amen.

290
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And so that's what we can hold our hat on.

291
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Because he is a good father who has provided a way in the midst

292
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 of our pain.

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 In the midst of our obstacles.

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And those obstacles are opportunities to trust God more

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 and to give him glory.

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Jesus says it like this in John 16.33...

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 I have said these things that in me you may have peace.

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Anybody want peace tonight?

299
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I do.

300
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 In the world you will have tribulation but take heart,

301
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I've overcome the world.

302
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 What do you do with the big question marks in life when the

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Bible is filled with a bunch of exclamation points?

304
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Like your job isn't hitting the way it should.

305
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Like you didn't get the promotion, you didn't get the

306
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 raise.

307
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Maybe a loved one has passed away.

308
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 You found out that someone has stage 4 cancer.

309
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 A friend stabs you in the back.

310
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You thought you would be out of debt by now.

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And what we do is we start to question God's ability to make

312
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 the obstacles in our life opportunities for our good and

313
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 his glory.

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 This is why if you lead someone to Christ, don't tell them

315
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 everything will turn out well in their life.

316
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Like right here and now.

317
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It will ultimately.

318
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 But it might get harder.

319
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Because a Christian isn't exempt from the pains of this world.

320
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 When sin entered the world it sent creation into chaos.

321
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 So what's our solution?

322
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Is it deism?

323
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Like God is just absent.

324
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 He's the creator of everything.

325
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 But he went on furlough.

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 He's just taking a break.

327
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Is it dualism?

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Is that the solution?

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 That God and Satan are kind of equal and there's this tennis

330
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 match going on with God and Satan and sometimes Satan wins and

331
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 sometimes God wins.

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 No.

333
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Genesis 3.15, read it.

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It's the first gospel.

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 It's called proto-evangelion for all my nerds in the room

336
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 tonight.

337
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's the first, proto-first, evangelion gospel.

338
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It tells us that there's coming a Messiah who will crush the

339
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 head of the serpent.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And we saw that.

341
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 What in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John where Jesus

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 went ultimately to the cross to crush the head of the serpent,

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Satan.

344
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And to once and for all end the curse for all men.

345
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 For those of us that puts our faith and trust in him.

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Have you ever read the book of Job?

347
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Man, Job lost his possessions, his children and his health.

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Do we have to understand all things?

349
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 No, but we have to understand that God is in control of all

350
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 things.

351
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 I've said this before here at the porch, but if I go home

352
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 tonight and I found out that my house was burned down and my

353
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 wife and my three kids were killed in the fire.

354
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Don't try to comfort me and tell me that accidents happen.

355
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 I can't deal with that.

356
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I can't deal with that.

357
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I got to know that there's a God that's in control.

358
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Like if I find out tomorrow that I have stage 4 cancer and just

359
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 two weeks to live.

360
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Like I can't deal with the fact that God isn't God.

361
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And hasn't provided a way for me to be reconciled to him.

362
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 You know where I'm going to end up?

363
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Going back to the bottle.

364
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Going back to an illegitimate relationship.

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Going to a pill.

366
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Going to what the world has offered us.

367
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 That's where I will go.

368
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And I will find that that's an empty well because I've already

369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 gone there in my past.

370
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I have to know that God is in control.

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Like you're not going to comfort me by saying God is not God.

372
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Let me ask you this question.

373
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 How many of you in the last five years have gone through deep

374
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 seated pain that you really can't make sense of?

375
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Just show of hands.

376
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Put your hands up in the air.

377
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Yeah, high.

378
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 That's a majority of us in the room.

379
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 So what's our solution?

380
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 We remember the gospel.

381
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Like we remember the gospel.

382
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The greatest act of injustice that's ever happened,

383
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 the perfect person Jesus, whoever lived was the divine man.

384
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Rejected, betrayed, denied, tortured, put on a cross and killed.

385
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 He of all people didn't deserve any of it.

386
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Jesus was the one person who did everything God required of him and

387
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 he didn't fail at any point.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And what did he get for his obedience and righteousness?

389
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 He got tortured, nailed to the cross and suffocated to death.

390
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 What good could possibly come out of an evil like that?

391
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Yet God turned the most evil thing that has ever happened into the

392
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 best thing that has ever happened.

393
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Today we can celebrate Jesus' suffering and death because he

394
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 triumphed over sin.

395
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Today we can celebrate that the grave is empty.

396
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 And if the grave is empty, then anything is possible.

397
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Amen.

398
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Jesus rose from the dead, defeated evil and sin,

399
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and the ball's in your court.

400
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 [Applause]

401
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 This is the hope that we have.

402
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And so we can be reconciled with our creator and know that God is God.

403
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And he can take our obstacles and use them for our good and his glory.

404
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Are you trying to tell me, Josiah,

405
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 that he can cause all things to work together for the good of those who

406
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 love him and are called according to his purpose?

407
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Yeah.

408
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Where do I get that?

409
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Where do you get that?

410
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Romans 8.28.

411
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Look what it says.

412
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Fix your eyes on the screen.

413
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Let this wash over you tonight.

414
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And we know that those who love God,

415
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 all things work together for good for those who are called according to

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 his purpose.

417
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Passing the baton of our faith happens when we see obstacles as

418
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 opportunities for my good and his good.

419
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Lesson three.

420
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Reach your generation for the gospel.

421
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 The gospel is the power of God.

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 So share it often.

423
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Romans 1.16, Paul says it like this.

424
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 For I'm not ashamed of the gospel,

425
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.

426
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Everyone.

427
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 For the Jew first and also the Greek.

428
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I believe God is going to do something amazing today.

429
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And he wants to use you to do it.

430
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I believe God is going to do something incredible in this place.

431
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He's going to do something incredible around me.

432
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And all I got to do is avail myself to the glory of God.

433
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 I got to avail myself to God and say, God,

434
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I want your heart to be a light in my heart so that you can use me in

435
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 spite of me for your kingdom purpose.

436
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 That our hearts should be fully devoted to him.

437
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 What if that was our prayer?

438
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Why?

439
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Because he wants to use you to reach your generation.

440
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Second Chronicles 16.9 says it like this.

441
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to

442
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 those whose hearts are not blinded by the eye of the Lord.

443
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And I want you to give strong support to those whose heart is

444
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 blameless toward him.

445
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 To those whose perfection is blameless towards him?

446
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 No.

447
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 To those whose heart is blameless towards him.

448
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Avail yourself to the work of God and watch God move in your life in

449
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 ways that you never thought were possible.

450
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 First off, know that God can use me when you understand that you have need.

451
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 You know, the only thing you need to come to God is need.

452
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Like some of us right here today, like I'm going to get to God by doing good works.

453
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 If my good works outweigh my bad works, I'm going to get to God.

454
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Well, if that was the case, then why did Jesus die on the cross?

455
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Not one of us in this room is going to stand before God and pull out our

456
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 resume of good things that we've done and think that's suffice to get to him.

457
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 It's only because of what he did on the cross that you can be set free and

458
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 forgiven from your sin.

459
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I keep bumping my head against the same wall, making the same mistakes,

460
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 doing the same sins like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool that

461
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 returns to his folly.

462
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I keep going back to that which is disgusting, impure, and a mockery of God.

463
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And I need someone to save me, to reach in the miry pit and pull me out.

464
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 How do you know if you've done that?

465
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 When you begin to talk about what he delivered you from.

466
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 You're like, no, man, I'm never going to talk about that abortion.

467
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 No, I'm never going to talk about cutting and overeating or under eating

468
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 because life feels out of control and that's the only thing I can control.

469
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 I'm never going to talk about envy and jealousy.

470
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I'm never going to talk about my porn addiction, my secret sin.

471
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 No, when you begin to talk about it, guess what happens?

472
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Is the same baggage you used to carry, you begin to talk about it to other

473
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 people who carry that baggage and he begins to use your story for his glory

474
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 to help people who carry the same baggage you used to carry.

475
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That's how you know.

476
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 That's how you know that God can use you.

477
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Have you come in this room with need tonight?

478
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Have you bended the knee?

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Have you surrendered your life to him and are you beginning to talk about

480
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 the things that he has freed you from?

481
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 All of a sudden with the enemy used for evil, God begins to use it for good.

482
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 What else are you going to give your life to?

483
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 What else?

484
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Some of you are like, man, maybe.

485
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Maybe?

486
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Like some of us, man, and I get it, I was there.

487
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 We lack.

488
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 We look at this book and read it and we're like, man, God, can you truly

489
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 use the gospel to change people's lives?

490
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And it's Dallas and there is a lot of young adults here and it's kind of

491
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 the place to gather on a Tuesday night.

492
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Are people truly living the way this guy is proclaiming with a vein

493
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 coming out of the side of his head.

494
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Yes, they are living like this, man.

495
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And God is calling you to do the same.

496
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 You are like, give me a story, Josiah.

497
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Because I doubt the gospel can still change people.

498
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 All right, here you go.

499
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 I met a young adult.

500
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 And he began to struggle with his -- he was struggling with his

501
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 sexuality, gender dysphoria, the whole nine yards.

502
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And he got kicked out of his house when he opened up about it.

503
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 I said, come on, man, come in.

504
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Mi casa, su casa.

505
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Like let's go, let's do life together.

506
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And so he moves in.

507
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Make him a bed.

508
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Give him a room.

509
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And we begin to process what's happened.

510
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 I just listened to him, like what's your story, bro.

511
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 He begins to share his story.

512
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 You know what I didn't do?

513
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 What?

514
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 How dare you?

515
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 How could you feel like that?

516
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I just said, hey, man, I get how you got there.

517
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I get why you feel that way.

518
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I get why you think that.

519
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 But there's another way.

520
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And I began to share the gospel with him.

521
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And he began to renew his mind by getting into God's word.

522
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And he rejected the lies of the world.

523
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And you know what Jesus did?

524
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 He saved him.

525
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 He saved him by hearing the gospel.

526
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 When did we stop believing that the gospel wasn't enough to save somebody?

527
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Like the gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ and it can do anything as it

528
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 moves into your neighborhood.

529
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 And he begins to call you to something different.

530
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It begins to renew the mind.

531
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And you begin to reject the lies that you began to believe in way back when.

532
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And listen, man, maybe this is your story.

533
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 If your mind and body feel out of alignment with any type of sin,

534
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I'm not just talking about homosexuality, gender dysphoria.

535
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Listen, can we just be honest tonight?

536
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 There's more heterosexual sin going on in this room than homosexual sin.

537
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 I was one of them.

538
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Sleeping with anyone that's not your spouse.

539
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Pulling up the two-dimensional images before you go to bed.

540
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Anything that is inconsistent with the character of Christ will

541
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 ultimately kill you.

542
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And the world and the world are going to give you two different responses.

543
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 Here's what the world says.

544
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 Listen to your mind and do whatever your body wants.

545
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But check this out.

546
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 The word says something different.

547
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Romans 12 says this...

548
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 So worship is more than just singing songs.

549
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 It's offering our bodies to God as a living sacrifice.

550
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And then it goes on and says...

551
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 I'm not going to go into the modern of this world but watch this.

552
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

553
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is.

554
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 His good, pleasing and perfect will.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 So when your mind and body are out of alignment with any type of sin

556
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 under the sun, the world says listen to your mind and do whatever your

557
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 body wants.

558
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 But check this out.

559
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 The word says embrace your body but renew your mind.

560
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Now I just want to point out something, man.

561
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 This is a normative practice in the medical field.

562
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 So let me just not talk theological tonight.

563
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Let me just talk logical.

564
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Mind renewal, bringing our mind in alignment with our body is a

565
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 normative practice in the medical field.

566
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Here's an example.

567
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 If an 80-pound teenager walks into the doctor's office and says,

568
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 doc, I feel overweight.

569
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And she's anorexic.

570
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 The doctor is not going to sit there and say, well,

571
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 if your mind is telling you that, then let's get you on diet pills.

572
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Let's give liposuction.

573
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Let's have stomach binding surgery.

574
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 He would never do that.

575
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 A loving doctor would say, hey, let's go to work on the mind to

576
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 match the body instead of changing the body to match the mind.

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 That's what a loving doctor would do.

578
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 This is mind renewal.

579
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And as we understand that over time, this is what can happen when there's a

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 dysphoria between the mind and the body.

581
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Embrace your body but renew your mind.

582
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And by the power of the Holy Spirit, the God of the galaxies begins to show

583
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 you that there's another way that leads to life and not death.

584
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Proverbs 14.12 says there's a way that seems right to man or woman and that

585
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 way ends in death.

586
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Just this week, the Atlantic, look it up on Google,

587
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 came out with an article that says fewer sex partners means happier marriage.

588
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 I just love it when the world catches up with the Bible.

589
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Don't you just love that?

590
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 It's like, really?

591
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Like what the Bible has said for thousands of years.

592
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Fewer sex partners will actually give you more satisfaction in marriage.

593
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Hmm, sounds familiar, doesn't it?

594
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 The world's going to try to tell you that you need to do you.

595
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Whatever makes you feel loved, accepted, celebrated.

596
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 You need to get out there and make yours.

597
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Make a name for yourself.

598
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 I want you to know that the gospel still has the power to change.

599
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Passing the baton of our faith happens when we trust the gospel is enough to

600
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 reach our generation.

601
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Lesson four, community is greater than my comforts and conveniences.

602
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Young adults come up to me, every service usually,

603
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 and I listen to their story.

604
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And 99.9% of the time I usually respond with something like this.

605
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Are you in biblical community?

606
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 To which they would say, well, Josiah, it's hard.

607
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 To which I say, but so is isolation and living in a prison to your secret sins.

608
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Well, it's a lot of work.

609
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And I'll say, well, so is your job.

610
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I don't really have time.

611
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 But, bro, you work out every day and your screen time says five hours.

612
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Like, help me understand.

613
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Community is greater than our comforts and conveniences.

614
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Having biblical community is the number one piece of advice that I've given to

615
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 people who want to change their life outside of telling them about Jesus and

616
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 the gospel, why?

617
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Because 1 Corinthians 1533 says this, do not be misled.

618
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Bad company corrupts good character.

619
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Proverbs 13 says walk with the wise and become wise for a companion of fools

620
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 suffers harm.

621
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You already know this, man.

622
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 If you get drunk going to the bar, then stop going to the bar.

623
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 If you have sex with him every time you go to his apartment,

624
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 then stop going into his apartment.

625
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Ever.

626
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Like, my wife and I had to do this.

627
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Like, thank the Lord we weren't having sex.

628
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 But we were getting handsy.

629
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 I'm just being honest.

630
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 And I had to look at my community group in the eyes and say,

631
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 what's the solution to which they said quit being alone with them.

632
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Well, I want to be alone.

633
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Be alone in public.

634
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 You better stay some late nights in Starbucks.

635
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 For real.

636
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

637
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

638
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

639
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

640
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

641
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

642
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

643
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

644
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

645
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

646
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

647
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

648
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

649
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

650
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

651
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

652
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

653
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

654
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

655
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

656
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

657
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

658
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

659
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

660
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

661
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

662
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

663
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

664
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

665
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

666
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

667
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

668
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

669
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

670
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

671
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

672
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Because God is using you to fight the battle.

673
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
