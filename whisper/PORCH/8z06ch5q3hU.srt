1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,860
 - All right, here we go.

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,700
 - Here we are.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,440
 - Corona porch edition week three.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,180
 We are continuing this series on Esther,

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,620
 God save the queen, how you doing man?

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,700
 - I'm doing pretty good.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,540
 - Yeah.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,740
 - I'm excited just to be here.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,580
 - Come on bro, I love it man.

11
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,020
 - Yeah, it's just nice to get out of the house.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,400
 - It is so nice to get out of the house, good grief man.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,900
 - Everyone's gotta stay away from me.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,740
 - Cabin fever.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,580
 Hey, so we're gonna wrap up the book of Esther tonight.

16
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,420
 If you're just joining us,

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,060
 we'll give you a recap on everything that's been going on.

18
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,140
 But let me ask a question.

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,780
 What is your favorite board game?

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,780
 - Ooh, recently it's been,

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,460
 have you ever heard of secret Hitler?

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,740
 - Oh, I totally have heard of secret Hitler.

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,900
 - Yeah, if y'all have not seen secret Hitler,

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,220
 I would highly recommend it.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,140
 - Which sounds like a much worse game than it actually is.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it actually does.

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,020
 - Yeah, totally.

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,820
 - It's really weird, but such a fun game.

29
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,820
 Watermark favorite too.

30
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,800
 - It's a total Watermark favorite,

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,020
 which is gonna confuse people,

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,720
 but it is a great game.

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,780
 Risk would be up there, there's several games.

34
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,300
 In my house right now though, with little kids,

35
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,020
 we are reintroducing all types of games

36
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,060
 that are like from my childhood,

37
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,780
 in order to stop all the Disney watching that's taking place.

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,500
 So we're playing Guess Who, do you remember Guess Who?

39
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,340
 - Oh yeah.

40
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,260
 - You have to flip it open, you have to, yeah,

41
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,580
 flip them down if they're not the person.

42
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,100
 We're playing Hungry Hungry Hippos.

43
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,740
 - Oh, loud game. - My son.

44
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,380
 Oh, totally loud game, he's all about it.

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,980
 And I played a new game for the first time this week

46
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,860
 called Scattergories, you heard of Scattergories?

47
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,700
 - I don't think so.

48
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,060
 - Scattergories is like, if you're a millennial or younger,

49
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,400
 you probably have no idea what that game is,

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,380
 but my wife loves that game.

51
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,740
 She was like, we're playing this,

52
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,260
 and was trying to be a supportive husband,

53
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,140
 and so kids went down, we played Scattergories.

54
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,500
 Never played the game before, and I'm like, how do you play?

55
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,940
 And she was like, oh, you'll figure it out.

56
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,540
 And her mind is like really self-explanatory,

57
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,700
 which works at some level, but then there's different rules

58
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,300
 that are a part of it, so we started playing,

59
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,180
 and because I didn't know the rules,

60
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,060
 it was like every time I would try to do something,

61
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,660
 so the way it kind of high-level works is,

62
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,420
 and I'm gonna get blown up in the comments, I bet, on this,

63
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,460
 by people being like, you don't know how to play Scattergories

64
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,380
 is you'll roll the dice, and it'll have letters on the dice.

65
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,380
 So it's like a 26 edge die, or some level of edge.

66
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,500
 You roll it, and it's like a G, and then you pick a card,

67
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,540
 and on that card, it'll have 12 different categories

68
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,140
 of things where you have to write a favorite boy name

69
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,140
 that starts with a G, favorite music band, type of food,

70
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,620
 continent, or country, or just these different things.

71
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,700
 And so we're playing the game,

72
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,260
 and there'll be different things where she'd be like,

73
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,540
 no, you can't write the same name twice.

74
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,540
 So if you wrote down Garth Brooks for favorite musician,

75
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,940
 and then you wrote Garth for favorite boy's name

76
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,660
 that starts with a G, doesn't count.

77
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,220
 Or if you had two letters, two words that started

78
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,620
 with the same letter, and you're on S,

79
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,140
 and you have SpongeBob SquarePants, that'd be two S,

80
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,380
 so you get double points on that.

81
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,860
 So it'd be like, what, you're cheating.

82
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,900
 And it was because she didn't ever explain the rules.

83
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,820
 I didn't know exactly how to win the game,

84
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,420
 all that was involved, what would count against you,

85
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,140
 because if you don't know the game to a board,

86
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,740
 or how to play the rules, excuse me,

87
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,900
 if you don't know the rules to a game,

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,300
 you can't win the game.

89
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,140
 What does it have to do

90
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,420
 with what we're talking about tonight?

91
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,420
 - Well, as it relates to the game of life,

92
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,460
 what we talk about all the time with young adults

93
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,900
 is there are a lot of people,

94
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,980
 everyone is playing the game of life,

95
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
 but a lot of people don't know the rules,

96
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,380
 they don't know what it means to actually have a success,

97
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,220
 or to win, what failure looks like.

98
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,340
 And so just like in any board game,

99
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,940
 if you don't know the rules, you can't win the game.

100
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,500
 If you don't know the way life works,

101
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,820
 or really the rules, the objective of the game of life,

102
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,980
 if you will, you will not be able to win.

103
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,980
 And you may be thinking to yourself,

104
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,740
 no, I wanna know what success looks like, or thinks like.

105
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,940
 And so wherever you are listening right now,

106
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,900
 I just want you to think about like,

107
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,540
 what is a successful life to you look like?

108
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,700
 What are the objectives really of life?

109
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,460
 What would a failed life look like?

110
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,060
 And what would it look like to at the end of your days?

111
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,580
 I mean, 'cause there's nothing,

112
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,300
 there are at least few things more tragic,

113
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,260
 maybe nothing more tragic,

114
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,100
 than to get to the end of your life,

115
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,700
 or to the end of your 20s,

116
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,300
 or to the end of your 30s, or 40s, or 50s,

117
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,700
 and waste your life, or waste a decade,

118
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,020
 and not have played according to it.

119
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,480
 So God, all throughout the scriptures,

120
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,540
 gives us principles and truths

121
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,380
 that are a part of the rules of the game of life,

122
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,140
 if you will, 'cause he, as much as we ever will want to,

123
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,100
 wants us to experience success.

124
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,900
 He wants us to live a life of purpose,

125
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,800
 and a life that is at the end of our days,

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,380
 we look back and say, man, it wasn't a waste,

127
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,220
 and it wasn't a fail.

128
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,420
 So tonight, we're gonna continue the book of Esther.

129
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,820
 We're gonna look at three principles

130
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,380
 from the final four chapters.

131
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,020
 So we're about to go through some Bible tonight,

132
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,760
 that will relate to what it looks like,

133
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,620
 some key things that are involved,

134
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,180
 anytime you're gonna succeed at the game of life.

135
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,540
 So the book of Esther, for a recap,

136
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,340
 is a book that is about, it's named after Queen Esther.

137
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,600
 Takes place 500 years before Jesus was around.

138
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,100
 You know what country it's in, modern day country?

139
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,900
 - I don't wanna get it wrong.

140
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,460
 - Yeah, we, it's in Iran, modern day Iran.

141
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,320
 It was the Persian empire at that time.

142
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,900
 Basically, what had happened 500 years

143
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,700
 before Jesus was around, so 500 BC, Persia,

144
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,660
 which is a empire of ancient times,

145
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,200
 shows up, conquer the known world.

146
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,300
 They took over everything.

147
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,380
 They're led by a king named Xerxes.

148
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,260
 He's one of the main characters in the story.

149
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,500
 I said, when I think about Xerxes,

150
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,260
 I think of Jake Gyllenhaal from the one movie

151
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,620
 that probably no one has ever seen.

152
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,300
 There he is, just looking fly.

153
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,540
 Or he's King Xerxes, he rules over the land.

154
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,500
 He's powerful, he's wealthy, he's got the palace,

155
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,220
 he's got the kingdom, he's got everything.

156
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,080
 And he's not a believer in God,

157
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,260
 but he ends up, week one, we covered,

158
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,340
 holding a bachelor Persia, or a mixture

159
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,520
 between a bachelor and beauty competition

160
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,300
 and like sex competition to find

161
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,640
 who will be the next queen of Persia.

162
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,740
 And Esther was ripped out of her house

163
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,860
 and she was declared, she won the competition.

164
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,940
 So Esther, when I think of Esther,

165
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,020
 I think of Wonder Woman right here,

166
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,780
 'cause she's kind of the one woman in our story, Gal Gadot.

167
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,300
 - Wow. - Fierce, man.

168
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,140
 - So fierce.

169
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,020
 - So that's character number two.

170
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,820
 So you got King Xerxes, you got Esther,

171
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,620
 then you have Uncle Jesse Mordecais,

172
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,820
 who I think of Uncle Jesse, of course, the most famous.

173
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,540
 And then our villain, Haman, which is Jafar,

174
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,300
 whether you like the cartoon version of Jafar,

175
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,720
 which I think they'll pop up there,

176
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 or the real version of Jafar, there he is with Iago, man.

177
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,500
 - Yeah. - Straight up Iago.

178
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,300
 And those are the main characters.

179
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,220
 And so week one, we were introduced

180
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,320
 from this peasant girl, Esther,

181
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,540
 who all of a sudden goes from poverty to the palace.

182
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,580
 Then week two, we're introduced to the villain,

183
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,220
 where Haman set out a plot to kill all of the Jewish people,

184
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,380
 all the people of God.

185
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,340
 He basically, because Mordecai wouldn't bow and worship him,

186
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,660
 he was like, "I'm not just gonna kill you,

187
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,580
 I wanna kill all the Jewish people."

188
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,300
 And because Haman was number two in charge,

189
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,700
 he was the prime minister,

190
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,560
 he had the ability to put in a decree

191
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,580
 that allowed that to happen.

192
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,820
 So we're told that all the Jewish people knew

193
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,780
 there was gonna come a day, March 7th,

194
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,300
 where they were gonna all be killed.

195
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,740
 It was months ahead,

196
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,300
 and that they were gonna lose their lives.

197
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,460
 And then last week, we dove in

198
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,220
 and just kind of looked at three more truths

199
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,900
 as it relates to fairy tale faith and talked about Disney.

200
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
 So if week one was "Bachelor Persia,"

201
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,020
 and if week two was "Making a Murderer,"

202
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,260
 and if week three was Disney+, if you will,

203
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,440
 and what's involved in true faith,

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,620
 this week will be "Silver Linings Playbook."

205
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,000
 That even when you can't see it, God is at work.

206
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,800
 And even in the midst of all the craziness

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,380
 that has happened so far in this story,

208
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,200
 that looked chaotic, that at times was so painful,

209
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,820
 that at times clearly was,

210
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,540
 it just seemed like God was absent.

211
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,740
 - Would you say,

212
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,000
 ♪ Even when you don't see it, you're working ♪

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
 - That's right, I absolutely would.

214
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
 Had to.

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,220
 - You know they're all thinking it.

216
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,060
 - Oh, 100%.

217
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,900
 And even when all that's going on,

218
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,980
 that God is clearly at work.

219
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,220
 Esther is one of the few, the two books in the Bible

220
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,900
 that does not mention the word of God,

221
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,500
 or I mean the name of God.

222
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,760
 But even though he's absent,

223
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,860
 the whole purpose of the book

224
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,700
 is that God is at work throughout the story,

225
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,860
 and he's moving the pieces.

226
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
 Even when you can't see it, he's working.

227
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,700
 - That's right. - That's right.

228
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,220
 Hey, we're gonna be Esther chapter seven.

229
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,720
 If you have a Bible, flip it open there.

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
 If not, it'll be up on the screen,

231
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,940
 and we're gonna fly through this story.

232
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,820
 We're gonna go through like four chapters,

233
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,760
 and I'll summarize every now and then to keep it going.

234
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
 So here we go.

235
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,860
 Wait, what chapter?

236
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,420
 Chapter seven, last week ended with the king,

237
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,420
 and the queen, and Haman all having dinner.

238
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,340
 And the queen was like,

239
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,500
 "Hey, king, here's my one request.

240
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,540
 "I wanna have dinner again with you tomorrow."

241
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,680
 Because the king and Esther had not come to the king yet

242
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,320
 and said, "Hey, there's a plan to kill all my people.

243
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,540
 "And by the way, I'm Jewish."

244
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,940
 'Cause remember, she hid that.

245
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,200
 So that's where we're gonna pick it up.

246
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,280
 Dinner number two, we're sitting there

247
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,420
 with Esther, and the king, and Haman.

248
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,300
 What a bomb for sure.

249
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,140
 All right, verse one.

250
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,060
 So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther's banquet.

251
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,220
 So they're at the dinner table.

252
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,180
 On the second occasion, while they were drinking wine,

253
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,340
 and the king again said to Esther,

254
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,860
 "Hey, tell me what you want, Queen Esther.

255
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,920
 "What is your request?

256
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,660
 "I will give it to you even if it is up

257
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,180
 "to half of my kingdom."

258
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,020
 Queen Esther replied, "If I found favor with the king,

259
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,340
 "and if it pleases the king to grant my request,

260
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,720
 "I ask," here's my request,

261
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 "that my life and the lives of my people be spared.

262
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,500
 "For my people and I have been sold

263
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,460
 "to those who would kill, slaughter, and annihilate us."

264
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,920
 I love this next sentence.

265
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,060
 "If we had merely been sold as slaves,

266
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,700
 "I could remain quiet.

267
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,860
 "For that would have been too trivial a matter

268
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,420
 "to warrant disturbing the king."

269
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,600
 As in like, hey, they're planning to kill us.

270
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
 Had we just been sold as slaves,

271
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,520
 I wouldn't even have bothered you.

272
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,040
 I know you're a really busy guy,

273
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,760
 but I figured if they kill the queen,

274
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
 somebody is gonna lose their job

275
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,440
 'cause you're gonna be like, "Hey, where's the queen?"

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,920
 And they're gonna be like, "Oh, we killed her."

277
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,480
 And that's not gonna be a good day for anybody.

278
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,120
 So I figured it was probably worth bringing up to you.

279
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,620
 It's like such funny wording.

280
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,960
 Who would do such a thing?

281
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,400
 King Xerxes, Jake Gyllenhaal demands,

282
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,980
 "Who would be so presumptuous as to touch you, the queen?"

283
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,500
 Esther replied.

284
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,300
 And remember, it's Esther, Xerxes, and Haman

285
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,380
 sitting at the dinner table.

286
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,860
 - Jafar. - Jafar.

287
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,700
 - About to get exposed.

288
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,700
 - "This wicked Haman, who is our adversary and our enemy.

289
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,220
 "Haman grew pale with fright before the king and the queen."

290
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,440
 I don't think Haman knew that Esther was Jewish.

291
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,180
 So he's probably sitting in there at the dinner table

292
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,840
 with the king and the queen, and the queen's like,

293
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,420
 "Hey, king, here's my one request.

294
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,380
 "They're planning to kill me and all my people

295
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,320
 "and all my family."

296
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,900
 And Haman's going, "Wow, that is crazy.

297
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,340
 "I didn't know there was other crazy murderers out there

298
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
 "planning to genocide an entire people,

299
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,660
 "but who would do that against the queen?

300
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,280
 "That's nuts, who would ever do that?"

301
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,520
 And then she says, "By the way, it's Haman."

302
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,480
 And he's gotta be going, "I had no idea she was the queen,

303
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,680
 "the king." - The gulp.

304
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,340
 - Yeah, that's a huge gulp moment.

305
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,500
 "The king steps outside and he's in a rage.

306
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,640
 "Jumped to his feet, he went out into the palace garden.

307
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,100
 "Haman, however, stayed behind," verse seven,

308
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,940
 "to plead for his life with queen Esther.

309
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,740
 "For he knew that the king intended to kill him.

310
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,460
 "In his despair, he fell on the couch

311
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,080
 "where queen Esther was reclining.

312
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,580
 "Just as the king was returning from the palace garden,

313
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,100
 "the king exclaimed, 'Will he even assault the queen

314
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,100
 "'right here in the palace before my very eyes?'"

315
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,940
 So he's just groveling for his life

316
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,600
 and he falls on the couch that she's sitting on

317
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,660
 and the king comes back in

318
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,800
 and he doesn't think he's groveling,

319
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,620
 he thinks he's assaulting my wife.

320
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,120
 He's like, "Dude, this is game over."

321
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,660
 "As soon as the king spoke,

322
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,020
 "his attendants covered Haman's face, signaling his doom."

323
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,420
 They put a bag over his head.

324
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,340
 He'd never see light of day again.

325
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,300
 "Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs,

326
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,400
 "said, 'Haman has set up a sharpened pole

327
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,360
 "'that stands 75 feet tall in his own courtyard.

328
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,540
 "'He intended to use it to impale Mordecai,

329
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,900
 "'the man who saved the king from assassination.'"

330
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
 So Harbona's sitting there

331
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,580
 and we don't know what his feeling of Haman,

332
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,660
 but he at least is like, "Hey, I got an idea.

333
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,180
 "There's a big pole in Haman's yard.

334
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,380
 "He was planning to kill Mordecai."

335
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,260
 You remember Mordecai, the guy who saved your life.

336
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,100
 I mean, as great as that guy was,

337
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,740
 can't believe Haman would wanna do that,

338
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,940
 but why don't we throw him on the pole?

339
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,980
 - 'Cause he was trying to get a job.

340
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
 - Yeah, for sure.

341
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,920
 He was trying to get a promo.

342
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,140
 "Then impale Haman on it, the king ordered.

343
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,420
 "So they impaled Haman on the pole

344
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,580
 "he had set up for Mordecai

345
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,980
 "and the king's anger subsided."

346
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,260
 None of this is what the Bible is saying is good

347
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,900
 or right or ideal.

348
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,960
 It just is describing what happened.

349
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,560
 It's interesting, and we may come back to this,

350
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,300
 is that the enemy of God's people

351
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,820
 and his plot was ended by the death of someone

352
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,980
 on a wooden pole or on a tree.

353
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,300
 The same word is used for crucifixion.

354
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,500
 So it's just interesting parallel

355
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
 to what happened with Jesus years and years and years later,

356
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,100
 that Jesus would end the enemy's plot,

357
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,440
 not by the enemy dying on a pole,

358
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,740
 but by Jesus dying on a cross for you and for me.

359
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,680
 Esther chapter eight, verse one,

360
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,260
 "On the same day, King Xerxes gave the property of Haman,"

361
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,160
 who is number two in land, the guy's got a big estate,

362
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
 "the enemy of the Jews to Queen Esther.

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
 "Then Mordecai was brought before the king,

364
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,260
 "for Esther had told the king how they were related."

365
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,180
 It was her uncle.

366
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,580
 "And the king took off his signet ring,

367
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,900
 "which he had taken back from Haman,

368
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,880
 "and he gave it to Mordecai.

369
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,180
 "And Esther appointed Mordecai

370
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,080
 "to be in charge of Haman's property."

371
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,840
 So Mordecai all of a sudden is now elevated

372
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,420
 essentially to Haman's position, number two in the land.

373
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,800
 And Esther is given Haman's property.

374
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,940
 "Esther went again before the king,

375
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,040
 "falling down on his face at his feet

376
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,780
 "and begging him with tears to stop the evil plot

377
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,200
 "devised by Haman against the Jews."

378
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
 She goes down and she's like, "Please stop.

379
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,060
 "They're gonna kill my people.

380
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,040
 "He's fixed today."

381
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,700
 Remember that decree had gone out a couple of weeks ago,

382
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,780
 that just horrifically all the Jewish people were told

383
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,160
 on that fixed day, they were liable to be killed

384
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,680
 or anybody could kill them and take their stuff.

385
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,980
 And she's begging, "Please reverse that decree."

386
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,940
 "Esther said, 'If it pleases the king,

387
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,700
 "if I found favor with him,

388
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,760
 "and if he thinks it is right and I'm pleasing him,

389
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,980
 "let there be a decree that reverses the order of Haman,

390
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,820
 "who ordered that the Jews throughout the king's provinces

391
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,520
 "should be destroyed.

392
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,460
 "For how can I," verse six,

393
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,940
 "endure to see my people and my family

394
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,440
 "slaughtered and destroyed?"

395
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,060
 Verse eight, "Now go ahead and send,"

396
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,500
 King Xerxes replies,

397
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,800
 "send a message to the Jews in the king's name,

398
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
 "telling them whatever you want

399
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,920
 "and seal it with the king's ring.

400
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,900
 "But remember, whatever has already been written

401
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,940
 "in the king's name and sealed with his signet ring

402
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,940
 "can never be revoked."

403
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,920
 So this is interesting.

404
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,820
 And that time, any time a king

405
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,020
 or any time that the leader of the country made a law,

406
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,940
 it was impossible to reverse that law.

407
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,480
 You could make other laws,

408
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,600
 but unlike today where you can repeal something.

409
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
 And that time with the Persian empire,

410
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,000
 anytime a king made something,

411
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,720
 some people think it may have been

412
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
 because they thought of him as like deity

413
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,680
 or different reasons behind that,

414
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,640
 but they couldn't reverse it.

415
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,120
 They could just add other laws to it.

416
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,800
 So he's going, "I can't reverse the fact

417
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,920
 "that we already said the Jewish people

418
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,880
 "will be killed on this day,

419
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,320
 "but we can add additional laws."

420
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,580
 And he says, "Write whatever you want, put it in there."

421
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,280
 So in June 25th, I love the detail, man, of the Bible.

422
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,760
 King's secretaries were summoned

423
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,000
 and a decree was written exactly as Mordecai dictated it.

424
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
 The decree, verse 10, was written

425
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,560
 in the name of King Xerxes, sealed with the signet ring.

426
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,040
 And Mordecai sent the dispatches by swift messengers

427
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,600
 who rode fast horses,

428
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,360
 bred for the king's service all throughout the empire.

429
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,440
 Here's what the king's decree said.

430
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,340
 So Mordecai writes on the down, they send it out.

431
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,840
 It's a new decree.

432
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,320
 "It gave the Jews in every city authority

433
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,980
 "to unite and defend themselves.

434
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,120
 "They were allowed to kill, slaughter,

435
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,860
 "and annihilate anyone of any nationality or province

436
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,760
 "who might attack them or their children or their wives,

437
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,260
 "and to take the property of their enemies.

438
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,520
 "The chosen day for this event

439
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,700
 "throughout the provinces of King Xerxes

440
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,760
 "was March 7th of next year."

441
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,040
 So they had a decree that they were to be killed.

442
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,240
 And basically this new decree was like,

443
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,480
 "Hey, you guys can unite, prepare, be ready for war."

444
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,380
 It's pretty crazy.

445
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,200
 It's like the Hunger Games and Game of Thrones

446
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,380
 and just nuts stuff going on.

447
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
 And as we're gonna see though,

448
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,240
 God was clearly at work in the midst of all of it,

449
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,040
 but that's the second decree that's been put out there.

450
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,040
 Uh, the king's, oh, sorry, verse 15.

451
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,640
 "Then Mordecai left the king's presence

452
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,220
 "wearing the royal robe of blue and white,

453
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,860
 "the great crown of gold,

454
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,660
 "and an outer cloak of fine linen and purple."

455
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,180
 So he's looking good.

456
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,940
 "And the people of Susa celebrated the new decree.

457
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,860
 "The Jews were filled with joy and gladness,

458
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,560
 "were honored everywhere.

459
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,580
 "In every province and city,

460
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,300
 "wherever the king's decree arrived,

461
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,860
 "the Jews rejoiced and a great celebration took place

462
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,320
 "and declared a public festival and holiday.

463
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,320
 "And many of the people of the land became Jews themselves."

464
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,940
 We're gonna come back to that.

465
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,780
 Verse, "For they feared what the Jews might do to them."

466
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,180
 Chapter nine, verse one.

467
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,480
 "So on March 7th, the two decrees of the king,"

468
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,560
 so fast forward, 'cause remember it was in June 25th.

469
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,360
 Now we're all the way into March.

470
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,160
 The day comes, the two decrees of the king

471
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,000
 are put into effect.

472
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,220
 "And on that day, the enemy of the Jews,

473
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,700
 "who had hoped to overpower them,

474
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,020
 "but quite the opposite happened.

475
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,100
 "It was the Jews who overpowered their enemies."

476
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,380
 So anybody who came and attacked them,

477
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,560
 the Jewish people were victorious.

478
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,940
 "The Jews gathered together in cities

479
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,180
 "all throughout the king's provinces

480
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,180
 "to attack anyone who tried to harm them,

481
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,980
 "but no one could take a stand against them,

482
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,600
 "for everyone was afraid of them."

483
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,200
 And here's one of the reasons why, verse three.

484
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,720
 "For all the nobles," that's the royalty of the provinces,

485
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,420
 that's like the governors of all the states, if you will,

486
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,820
 'cause they have 127 states, be like in America,

487
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,380
 "All the people in authority in every state,

488
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,100
 "the highest officers, governors, royal officials,

489
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,840
 "they all helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai.

490
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,500
 "For Mordecai had been promoted in the king's palace,

491
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,780
 "and his fame had spread all throughout the provinces

492
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,620
 "and the empire."

493
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,880
 So they go out, they successfully defend themselves.

494
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,840
 The rest of the armies in these provinces

495
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,040
 help them and protect them.

496
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,020
 And so that's likely one of the reasons why,

497
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,680
 in addition to God just giving them favor and protection,

498
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,840
 that they are successful, they don't lose their lives,

499
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,220
 and they're victorious on that day.

500
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,120
 But the victory still involved them going to fight

501
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,240
 and then protecting themselves.

502
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,460
 It still involved a battle with them.

503
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,440
 Verse 20, "At the end, to celebrate the victory

504
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,760
 "that God had given them,

505
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,520
 "Mordecai recorded these events and he sent letters

506
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,800
 "to the Jewish people in the kingdom."

507
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,080
 So the battle's over, the Jewish people won

508
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,680
 and saved their lives.

509
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,060
 And Mordecai sends out letters to everybody

510
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,660
 in the, every Jewish person throughout the provinces,

511
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,120
 "Calling them to celebrate an annual festival

512
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,680
 "on these two days.

513
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,420
 "He told them to celebrate them with feasting and gladness

514
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,460
 "by giving gifts of food to each other,

515
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,860
 "presents to the poor.

516
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,260
 "This would commemorate a time when Jews gained relief

517
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,460
 "from their enemies,

518
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,680
 "when their sorrow was turned into gladness

519
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,580
 "and their mourning was turned into joy."

520
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,400
 So you following it?

521
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,340
 So basically, they're victorious and he's like,

522
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,540
 "We're for now on going forward,

523
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,100
 "gonna celebrate this day every single year."

524
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,900
 So Jewish people everywhere celebrate

525
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,780
 God's deliverance of his people.

526
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,900
 - The day that they were supposed to be wiped out.

527
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
 - Yes.

528
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,260
 The day they were supposed to die

529
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,180
 was the day that they--

530
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,020
 - Are now celebrating.

531
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,800
 - Celebrate are victorious.

532
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,020
 Skip down to verse 29 of chapter nine.

533
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,620
 "Queen Esther, daughter of Abigail,"

534
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,100
 Abigail, happy to say that.

535
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,800
 "Along with Mordecai, the Jew wrote another letter

536
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,860
 "putting the Queen's full authority

537
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,180
 "behind Mordecai's letter

538
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,860
 "to establish the festival of Purim,"

539
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,620
 which is a festival that even today,

540
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,100
 Jewish people still celebrate.

541
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,780
 But really the entire book ends

542
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,540
 and we're told that God,

543
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,660
 in the midst of all the brokenness and chaos,

544
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,000
 he preserves, he protects his people.

545
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,660
 He puts Esther in a position of authority

546
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,900
 and he reverses Haman's all the wicked plan

547
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,220
 and the day that they were to die

548
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,860
 became a day of celebration

549
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,760
 and the clear message of the entire book

550
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,800
 is that even when you can't see God's face,

551
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,960
 that he's not at the forefront,

552
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,580
 he is very clearly at work.

553
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,720
 Even when it looks like he's not working,

554
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,600
 he is using everything chaotic and broken,

555
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,800
 he's using Corona right now

556
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,120
 and he's still at work all around us.

557
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,240
 And that's really been the message

558
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,040
 and one of the reasons that today,

559
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,680
 again, as we said,

560
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,260
 Purim was celebrated a couple of weeks ago

561
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,640
 by those who are Jewish, if you have Jewish friends,

562
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,120
 but that took place this year on March 9th.

563
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,900
 But here's what I wanna focus on for a few minutes.

564
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,620
 I wanna pull out three principles

565
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,460
 that are just parallels to, I think, our experience

566
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,840
 as it relates to living a successful life.

567
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,360
 Three things that parallel.

568
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,200
 Anything you wanna add or clarify or that was confusing?

569
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
 - The one thing, it's a lot of text.

570
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,840
 - It's a lot of text.

571
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,120
 - I think the one thing, can you just paraphrase for me,

572
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,420
 so they couldn't get rid of a decree

573
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,260
 that the king had made,

574
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,760
 but they could write, she could write another one.

575
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,560
 He gave her the pen and paper and said,

576
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,460
 "You get to write it."

577
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,320
 - Mordecai, yeah.

578
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,120
 - Oh, okay, Mordecai got to write it.

579
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,340
 - Yep. - Good to know.

580
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,760
 And what exactly did he,

581
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,960
 can you just paraphrase one more time what he wrote?

582
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,800
 - He basically wrote out that,

583
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,640
 "Hey, all the Jewish people out there can band together."

584
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,120
 And it's kind of a funny thing,

585
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,040
 'cause you'd be like, "What else were you gonna do?"

586
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,480
 But they may have had access

587
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,840
 to the king's military or military around there.

588
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,220
 They certainly, by Mordecai writing that,

589
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,840
 were given encouragement from the local state governments

590
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,520
 that they were a part of to support the Jewish people.

591
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,800
 And basically he wrote out that Jewish people

592
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,720
 can proactively attack anybody

593
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,760
 that they think may be attacking them.

594
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,600
 - Gotcha.

595
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,120
 - So he gave the right and permission to do that legally.

596
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,920
 - So it made them seem more powerful.

597
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,760
 - Exactly.

598
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,880
 - That way everyone is like, "I'm with the Jews,

599
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,160
 'cause the king's with the Jews."

600
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,120
 - Exactly. - Gotcha.

601
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,000
 - Hey, you mess with them, it's not gonna go well.

602
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,640
 And even the local governors and governments

603
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,120
 were all supporting the Jewish people.

604
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
 - That's interesting.

605
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,320
 'Cause I think I naturally would have suspected

606
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,920
 some way for war not to even happen at all.

607
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,080
 I don't know, like something creative.

608
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,360
 But it's interesting to, okay, it makes a lot more sense.

609
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
 - Yeah, it is.

610
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,600
 That there was a victory, but it still involved fighting.

611
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,860
 So really, let me camp on three things

612
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,640
 that I think as we wrap up the book,

613
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,200
 just wanna highlight that I see in the story

614
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,880
 that's such a parallel to our lives.

615
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,520
 The first one is this.

616
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,660
 You and I can't change the past,

617
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,360
 but you can alter the future.

618
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,100
 Just like the king, he couldn't change what had been written,

619
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,320
 but he could write a new law.

620
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,040
 Hey, I can't change what's in the past, that's already there,

621
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 but I can change what will happen in the future.

622
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,280
 That's such a parallel, I think,

623
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,840
 for our experiences as humans,

624
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,680
 because you and I, at some point in realizing in life,

625
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,880
 if you're gonna have a successful life,

626
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
 you've gotta realize,

627
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,160
 hey, I can't go back and relive the past.

628
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,560
 There's gonna be things in my rear view mirror

629
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,360
 from high school, college, whatever stage of life you're in

630
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
 that you wish you had a do-over on,

631
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,440
 and although you cannot go back and rewrite the past,

632
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,320
 you can rewrite the future that you're in.

633
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,040
 And this is so huge, because people,

634
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,360
 they walk around today,

635
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,760
 and the shame and guilt from their past,

636
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,640
 I mean, Christians will walk around today,

637
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
 and they have shame and guilt from past decisions,

638
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,760
 past broken relationships, abortion, sexual abuse,

639
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,920
 things that were done to them.

640
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,320
 And there's this sense of like,

641
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,160
 man, I just carry a guilt

642
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,240
 that I wish I could do away with, or get rid of,

643
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,000
 or I wish that I hadn't blown it on my first job

644
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,880
 with that employer, with parents.

645
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,000
 You cannot go back and undo the past.

646
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,640
 Jesus can forgive, and it has been forgiven

647
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,720
 if you are in Christ.

648
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,300
 And although you cannot go and do that,

649
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,240
 you can rewrite the future you're headed to.

650
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,420
 Paul, the apostle, would say that you, if you're in Jesus,

651
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,120
 you're no longer marked by the things

652
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
 that you've done before.

653
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,880
 You're no longer marked by your past,

654
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,200
 that if anyone is in Christ,

655
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,640
 2 Corinthians 5, verses 16 and 17,

656
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,900
 they're a new creation.

657
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,140
 The old is gone, and the new is here.

658
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,040
 Paul, who was a murderer,

659
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,840
 who could have been easily tempted to go like,

660
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,720
 man, I cannot believe,

661
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,740
 he was a murderer before he became a Christian.

662
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,080
 Like he had done things that most people listening

663
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,440
 will never compare to the level.

664
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,320
 Paul said he was the chief of sinners.

665
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,440
 And we at least know he was responsible

666
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
 for the death of Christians.

667
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,560
 And he says, "One thing, I do not consider myself

668
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,740
 "as having taken hold of everything in Christ,

669
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,860
 "but one thing I do, I forget what is behind me,

670
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,280
 "and I strain towards what is ahead."

671
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,760
 Not that there's not consequences for decisions in our past,

672
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,000
 and not that there's not things that we can go back

673
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,160
 and own and ask forgiveness for,

674
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,680
 but you cannot rewrite the past,

675
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,940
 but you can rewrite the future.

676
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,040
 And that's important,

677
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,920
 because unproductive is me sitting around being like,

678
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,120
 man, I just, I'm covered in shame and guilt.

679
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,080
 I'm damaged goods.

680
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,580
 This is how I see it a lot of times play out

681
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,180
 with young adults, is they think like,

682
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,560
 dude, I'm just, I'm damaged goods

683
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,960
 because of my dating history,

684
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,800
 what I've done with guys, my sexual past.

685
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,480
 Like a godly girl, a godly guy will never like me.

686
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,640
 - Yeah, being abused.

687
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
 - I've been abused. - Abortion.

688
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,720
 - It's just, I had an abortion.

689
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,680
 Like I just, I'm unworthy.

690
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,040
 And the message of the gospel

691
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,480
 is that you have been totally forgiven.

692
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,080
 And Jesus doesn't look at you and define you by your past.

693
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,840
 And he wants you to begin to realign

694
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,480
 and redefine your future according to his word.

695
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,440
 And that is a place where you are in the driver's seat.

696
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,680
 While you can't go back and rewrite

697
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,080
 just like the king, I can't re undo

698
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,720
 what has already taken place and been written,

699
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,400
 but I can write something new.

700
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
 And so for us, I think it looks like us going,

701
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,820
 man, I am in the driver's seat of writing the future

702
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,680
 that God is, the future story I'm gonna have

703
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,420
 and the future that is in front of me.

704
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,040
 How am I doing at really taking advantage of that?

705
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,920
 - Yeah, I, another one, a person I wanna speak to,

706
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,320
 I just thought of was like, I think someone who's been caught

707
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,920
 like if you've been caught in a really wrong action,

708
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,240
 a sinful action, whatever it may be,

709
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,520
 I think a lot of times the enemy really keeps you stuck.

710
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,640
 Like he, it almost like the shame that comes with being caught

711
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,800
 can almost make you feel like you're never worthy again

712
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,520
 to do something, especially something kingdom minded.

713
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,400
 Something with the Lord on your side,

714
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,600
 it can just forever feel like

715
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,040
 that's kind of your reputation now.

716
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,520
 And so just even this applies to the person

717
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,120
 that has been caught in an action.

718
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,160
 - Totally. - They're ashamed of.

719
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,960
 And for me, David, like something you're making me think of

720
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,360
 is in this story, when the king is giving Mordecai

721
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,160
 the ability to rewrite, he says,

722
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,720
 "But you may write," in verse eight of chapter eight,

723
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,920
 "But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews

724
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
 "in the name of the king and seal it with the king's ring

725
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,500
 "for an edict written in the name of the king

726
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,320
 "and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked."

727
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,400
 And I'm so sorry if you were going here, I don't,

728
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,240
 but Ephesians one just says, "In him,"

729
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,640
 so in the death of Christ

730
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,360
 and his death, burial and resurrection,

731
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,160
 "In him, you also, when you heard the word of truth,

732
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,240
 "the gospel of your salvation and believed in him

733
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,600
 "were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit."

734
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,960
 And Titus 3, five, "He saved us not because of works

735
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,160
 "done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy

736
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,600
 "by the washing of regeneration

737
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,920
 "and the renewal of the Holy Spirit."

738
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,560
 That Holy Spirit that seals us.

739
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
 And I think a lot of people, they think,

740
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,520
 like you're saying, something of their past,

741
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,920
 that that ceiling doesn't exist for them.

742
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,400
 It's like, well, I broke it and now I'm over, I'm doomed,

743
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,360
 but this tells us that the Holy Spirit

744
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,240
 is what secures our identity in Christ.

745
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,080
 - Totally.

746
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,680
 - It's not dependent on our own actions.

747
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,560
 - Yeah. - It's really encouraging.

748
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,400
 - So really wallowing in the past is just not a,

749
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,840
 for a follower of Jesus, the best thing you can do is say,

750
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,040
 "Hey, the past doesn't define me, Jesus does,

751
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,400
 "and now I get to be a part of helping define the future

752
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,480
 "in front of me."

753
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,620
 So wherever you're at today,

754
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,360
 the best opportunity in front of you is going,

755
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,080
 "Man, I wanna be on purpose and intentional

756
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,420
 "as I write the person, as I write the chapter

757
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,060
 "that I'm gonna live out as the future in front of me comes.

758
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,980
 "I'm gonna surrender every day to Jesus

759
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,880
 "and try to live according to his word.

760
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
 "I'm gonna, some of you that maybe,

761
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,180
 "I need to confess hidden sin

762
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,100
 "that I've never opened up to anybody about.

763
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,500
 "Others, you being intentional to rewrite

764
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,020
 "or write the future that,

765
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,260
 "that future story you're gonna tell

766
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,220
 "will involve you breaking up with a relationship right now

767
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,840
 "that you just know is toxic,

768
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,320
 "or you're not in a place to date."

769
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,540
 Like, let's just be honest.

770
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,480
 You're not in a place where you're healthy enough.

771
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,160
 Others of you, it may involve forgiving a family member

772
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,260
 who really hurt you, or asking for forgiveness

773
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,460
 from a family member that you really hurt,

774
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,440
 even if they haven't asked you for that forgiveness.

775
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,900
 Like, "Hey, I'm just gonna extend it."

776
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,900
 But we are all in the driver's seat,

777
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,020
 largely as it relates to writing the story in front of us.

778
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,100
 So you can't undo the past,

779
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,540
 but you can rewrite or alter the future

780
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,380
 that you're gonna head.

781
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,220
 And you are headed towards.

782
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,060
 And I think one thing that ministered to me

783
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,460
 that I've been, I heard recently from a friend

784
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,460
 that is like, at some point, this season of Corona,

785
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,140
 we talked about it on "Views from the Porch,"

786
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,640
 is gonna be a story that we look back on,

787
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,020
 and it was a season of our life,

788
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,820
 and we tell about that season.

789
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,420
 Like, it's a story, it'll be a part of all of our story,

790
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,620
 it'll be in the past,

791
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,940
 and it'll be a part of the story that we tell.

792
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,380
 And that's really true for all of us in life right now.

793
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,240
 At some point, this season today,

794
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,780
 what you're doing with your 20s,

795
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,820
 the type of dating relationships and how you date,

796
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,340
 the way you use your time, how you work at the office,

797
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,780
 that's all gonna be a part of the story

798
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,300
 that when you're 40 or 50 or 60,

799
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
 you're gonna look back and be,

800
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,140
 "This is the story of how I met your mom,

801
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,460
 "how we pursued purity, how we dated together,

802
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,140
 "or hey, how we kinda slept together.

803
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,080
 "We met at that bar, we met on Tinder,

804
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,820
 "and we ended up just getting married

805
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,460
 "after we lived together for three years."

806
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,700
 Both of those are two versions of stories,

807
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,860
 and you get to today decide which type of story

808
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,300
 do you wanna tell, and which story are you writing?

809
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,260
 Because the decisions you're making today

810
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,460
 are shaping the future you're headed to.

811
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,300
 - That's so good.

812
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,460
 - So here, really quickly, the next one,

813
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,140
 and I don't know how much time we have here,

814
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,420
 but next one on--

815
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,260
 - You're doing great.

816
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,700
 - Yeah, where you gonna go, man?

817
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,540
 Can't go anywhere.

818
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,360
 - What do you hope you have to do?

819
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,820
 - Corona, for real.

820
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,020
 - The next thing from this story that just jumps out to me

821
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,180
 that we talked a little bit about already

822
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,180
 was you can't win the battle if you aren't willing to fight.

823
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,620
 You can't win any victory,

824
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,020
 you won't have victory over a battle,

825
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,060
 like you won't win the battle if you're not willing to fight.

826
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,040
 What does that have to do with us?

827
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,860
 And none of us are, most of us are not, you know,

828
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,940
 in the army or in the military.

829
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,300
 Here's where I see it in their story.

830
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,500
 God said, "God provided a way and a path towards victory,

831
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,140
 "but it involved them still fighting."

832
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,500
 Like you observed that, which is really interesting.

833
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,340
 You could have thought like,

834
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,180
 "Oh, he just stopped everything from happening."

835
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,460
 And he didn't, he involved a victory

836
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,580
 that also involved them fighting.

837
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,740
 And I think for most of us,

838
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,900
 no, not even for most of us, for all of us,

839
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,820
 any great victory over the spiritual battles

840
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,500
 and temptations and sins that you have to wage war against

841
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,340
 and I have to wage war against involves us both

842
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,800
 all having to fight.

843
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,460
 There's this idea in Christianity that,

844
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,880
 hey, once you become a Christian,

845
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,260
 the temptations I have to lust after people

846
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,180
 who are not my wife or to get angry at people

847
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,260
 who frustrate me or to be selfish,

848
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,780
 all those kind of just went away

849
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,700
 'cause the Holy Spirit now takes over.

850
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,620
 And that for most, not even for most of us,

851
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,500
 for everyone is not the case.

852
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,580
 That when you follow Jesus,

853
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,820
 it involves daily picking up your cross,

854
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,940
 Jesus would say in Mark chapter nine,

855
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,740
 and following him, which is daily dying to yourself

856
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,720
 and dying to your sin nature.

857
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,240
 How would you describe a sin nature?

858
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,560
 - A sin nature is that thing in me

859
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,740
 that has always just been there.

860
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,380
 And a really practical example,

861
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,980
 if I were to go home right now

862
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,840
 and my roommates who have been at home all day,

863
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,500
 there's dishes in the sink,

864
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
 I could walk in and just naturally,

865
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,320
 I could just naturally assume the worst and be like,

866
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,740
 man, they're so lazy.

867
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,580
 They've just been sitting around here

868
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,700
 watching Netflix all day

869
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,180
 and no one's doing the dishes

870
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,500
 and just find myself frustrated at my roommates.

871
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,660
 And for all I know, they've had a really difficult day.

872
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,020
 And instead of just doing the dishes,

873
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,140
 like that's just something in me

874
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,980
 that just is just naturally there

875
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
 and it's always been there.

876
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,340
 - Yeah, it's a thing in all of us

877
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,940
 that allows sin to come naturally.

878
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,420
 It's like why I never have to work at being angry.

879
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,380
 Like you've never had to work at being selfish.

880
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,140
 Nobody has to work at being like,

881
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,460
 you know what's really hard for me?

882
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,740
 Well, I don't know if this is true for most of us,

883
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,060
 lusting or being entitled.

884
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,940
 That just, it doesn't come easy for me.

885
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,380
 I feel like I'm just so gracious and good.

886
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,500
 That person listening is clearly clouded by pride

887
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,260
 that comes naturally and easy to that person.

888
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,620
 But it's that thing inside of all of us

889
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,900
 where sin just comes naturally.

890
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,880
 It's a part of our nature.

891
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,220
 The Bible says that is your sin nature.

892
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,200
 And as long as you and I are in this life,

893
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,100
 that's gonna be a part of our life.

894
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,200
 And so daily, I have to not listen to that

895
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,080
 and put that to death

896
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,780
 and try to walk in dependence on the spirit of God.

897
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,180
 In Romans 8, verse 13, along this idea of,

898
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,840
 hey, you can't win the battle.

899
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,940
 If your battle's anxiety,

900
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,140
 maybe it's an eating disorder, a pornography,

901
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,660
 a body image in general,

902
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,660
 maybe it's an anger problem, whatever, fill in the blank.

903
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,740
 You won't win that battle without you fighting against that,

904
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,820
 making the decision when I don't want to,

905
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,060
 when it's not easy,

906
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,040
 when it doesn't feel like the right thing to do.

907
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,860
 I'm gonna choose to put that to death

908
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,700
 and choose not to follow that

909
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,500
 and try to follow God's word.

910
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 In Romans 8, I said that, verse 13, it says,

911
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,140
 "If you live according to your sinful nature, you will die.

912
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,820
 But if by the spirit you put to death

913
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,020
 the misdeeds of the body, you will live."

914
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,380
 Colossians chapter three says,

915
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,360
 "Put to death whatever belongs to your earthly nature."

916
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,700
 Sexual morality, and he just gives some examples.

917
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,680
 Impurity, lust, evil desires, greed, which is idolatry.

918
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,100
 In 1 Peter chapter two, verse 11, it says,

919
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,260
 "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles,

920
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,420
 abstain from your sinful desires,

921
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,580
 which wage war against your soul."

922
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,740
 The Bible says, you and I have to declare war

923
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,020
 on our sin nature, on all the different ways

924
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,940
 that sin manifests, or sin pops up in my life.

925
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,500
 Anytime it happens, I gotta go to war against it.

926
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,740
 And I love Peter's language 'cause he says,

927
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,300
 "Your sin nature's already declared war on you.

928
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,920
 You should declare war on it."

929
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,260
 That John Owen, this old pastor, made a line that like,

930
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,780
 "Hey, if you are either, all of us in life

931
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,560
 are either killing sin or it is killing us."

932
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,100
 It's killing relationships,

933
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,660
 it's killing our relationship with God,

934
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,960
 our love for people, killing like,

935
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,660
 it ends people's actual lives all the time.

936
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,660
 And the Bible says that you and I can experience victory,

937
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,460
 but it involves a fight, a battle.

938
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,700
 So if your struggle is same-sex attraction,

939
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,260
 if it is an eating disorder, if it's lust or anger,

940
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,500
 like are my problems, it involves me daily.

941
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,020
 Here's what I said the battle looks like.

942
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,620
 Here's how I define it.

943
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,860
 And scripturally, at least, he calls us to all this.

944
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,520
 I'd love to hear what you'd add or if you agree.

945
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,460
 Biblically, we battle by living authentically

946
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,520
 with the people of God, according to the word of God,

947
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,820
 and depending on the spirit of God.

948
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,500
 Biblically, here's how you battle.

949
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,380
 Every single day, this is a day by day, it's not fixed,

950
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,700
 it's not a one time.

951
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,180
 Every day, I have to battle by living authentically,

952
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,900
 that's confessing sin to other people

953
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,260
 who are followers of Jesus, at like a heart level.

954
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,300
 Like I was tempted, I'm tempted to believe

955
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,340
 that my worth comes from my paycheck.

956
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,740
 I'm tempted to believe that, it's tempted to just lust.

957
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,460
 I'm having lustful thoughts about a coworker

958
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,180
 that I work with or about past relationships,

959
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,860
 or I clicked on something on the internet,

960
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,500
 on social media that I just like spent too much time

961
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,420
 on that girl's page.

962
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,780
 I gotta confess all those things

963
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,620
 and do confess all those things to my small group of guys.

964
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,700
 As I wage war and battle,

965
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,040
 I'm living authentically with the people of God,

966
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,800
 according to the word of God that I wanna align.

967
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,380
 And this is tricky in this culture, man,

968
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,220
 'cause the Bible says align your life with the word of God.

969
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,420
 And everybody wants to align the word of God

970
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,780
 with their wants.

971
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,300
 Like this is kind of, this is what I think he really means

972
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,020
 and that's not relevant, it's kind of outdated.

973
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,140
 And you can't trust everything that's in there.

974
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,840
 I mean, we don't eat shellfish, we do eat shellfish,

975
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,780
 come on, good grief.

976
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,340
 - Leviticus. - Leviticus.

977
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,420
 It's like the go-to everyone has, it's like Leviticus.

978
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,340
 - Don't have tattoos.

979
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,700
 - You still eat bacon, right?

980
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,580
 You say no bacon?

981
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,660
 No, with so many podcasts we have out on there,

982
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,980
 that is a dumb question,

983
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,540
 but if that is something you fall into,

984
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,780
 go check us out on Abuse from the Forge

985
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,220
 as it relates to why the Bible's appropriate or relevant.

986
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,740
 But point being, I live authentically with the word of God.

987
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,500
 I try to align my life and have others align my life with,

988
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
 sorry, with the people of God,

989
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,940
 align my life with the word of God

990
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,100
 and walk in dependence on the spirit of God.

991
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,060
 The day by day, God, I can't defeat anger,

992
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,320
 I can't defeat lust, I can't defeat anxiety,

993
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,220
 I need your help.

994
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,680
 And that just involves, and moment by moment, prayerfulness

995
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,660
 and trying to walk in the spirit.

996
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:10,660
 And anytime that I don't walk in line, I don't battle,

997
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,600
 I do the first thing.

998
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,280
 I live authentically with the people of God

999
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,760
 and I bring it into the light

1000
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,360
 and I have others encourage me on that journey.

1001
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,920
 But that's a day by day, every single,

1002
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,240
 I think the thing that's hardest for me,

1003
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,920
 the thing that I hate about it is I wish it was gone.

1004
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,960
 I wish it was over, you didn't have to battle.

1005
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,240
 And every day I have to get up and still battle that.

1006
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,180
 Last year, I think I've shared on here before,

1007
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,520
 went through regeneration, which is our 12 step recovery.

1008
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,720
 And it's like celebrate recovery.

1009
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,120
 It's an amazing ministry if you're in Dallas

1010
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,220
 or if you have regeneration at your church.

1011
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,040
 But just because I saw like there was some anger in my heart

1012
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,360
 and lust that I wanted to get rid of

1013
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,200
 and really just anger that was not allowing me

1014
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,080
 to respond in a way that was the gentleness

1015
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,120
 or the husband that had gentleness

1016
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,160
 and care and consideration.

1017
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,480
 And I was like, I don't want to live life

1018
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,220
 and not have done everything I can

1019
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,780
 to be the father I wanna be, the husband I wanna be,

1020
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,360
 the person that I wanna be and the follower of Jesus.

1021
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,360
 And in that process, it just was pulling back layers

1022
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,840
 and going, God, make me more like Christ,

1023
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
 will you help me?

1024
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,200
 There's still so much brokenness in my heart

1025
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,840
 and I need your help.

1026
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,600
 And daily, I wish regeneration,

1027
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,680
 it was like, it's over, finished.

1028
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,160
 Took me a year, I went through it.

1029
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,720
 And now for the rest of your life,

1030
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,480
 you're just learning to put to death the deeds of the flesh,

1031
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,320
 to put to death that sinful nature inside of you.

1032
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
 So I think again, the idea of you can't win,

1033
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,260
 you will not be victorious, whatever your struggle is.

1034
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,320
 I just wanna put to death the lie that people have out there

1035
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
 that you're gonna wake up one day

1036
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,540
 and you won't even desire,

1037
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,400
 same sex attraction won't happen.

1038
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,680
 Maybe that's a part, maybe that'll happen,

1039
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,920
 but for a lot of people, that's not.

1040
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,640
 And they constantly put it to death

1041
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
 or one day you're gonna wake up

1042
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,360
 and you no longer have anxiety.

1043
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,120
 I don't know the person that that's their story.

1044
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,440
 And they're probably out there and God bless them.

1045
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,920
 For most of us, it involves doing what Paul said,

1046
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,320
 walk by the spirit and you will not gratify

1047
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,360
 the sinful nature, Galatians 5.

1048
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,100
 So anything you'd add?

1049
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,080
 - Yeah, I gotta make sure I don't,

1050
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,840
 there's like a passion point of mine.

1051
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,480
 And I think especially because I know a lot of people

1052
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,440
 my age, we have almost unintentionally

1053
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,320
 been trained to be consumers.

1054
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,360
 And what happens to consumers, they become fat

1055
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,960
 and they don't know how to do things on their own.

1056
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,420
 They're just sitting there like a baby bird

1057
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,360
 with their mouth open, wanting to be fed by their mom.

1058
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,800
 And they never become mature Christians.

1059
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,420
 They don't ever get to feast on the meat.

1060
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,520
 They stay on the milk all of their life.

1061
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,560
 And that's not the life that Christ calls us to live.

1062
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,240
 And so for me, I always tell people,

1063
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,080
 hey, you have to get out of that consumeristic mindset.

1064
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,880
 You have to stop waiting for things to come to you

1065
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,800
 and you have to start being proactive, not reactive.

1066
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,560
 That's what I always say, because the war is coming to you.

1067
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,560
 That's why I personally love watching war movies

1068
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,840
 because it reminds me so much of this mentality.

1069
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,400
 There is a spiritual war going,

1070
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,840
 waging war against my flesh every day.

1071
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,800
 And I think a lot of people are like,

1072
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,240
 oh, it's too gory, it's too bloody.

1073
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,680
 And I'm like, that is nothing compared

1074
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,960
 to the spiritual war that is going on.

1075
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,960
 And the enemy, that way that he is wanting to destroy you

1076
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,600
 is nothing compared to even what you're seeing on that movie.

1077
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,640
 And in those movies, a lot of times what's happening is,

1078
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,880
 it's like there's that scene

1079
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,600
 where everything finally calms down

1080
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,120
 and everyone's asleep, like in the bunkers or whatever.

1081
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,960
 And then what do you know?

1082
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,000
 You hear the sound and then just a bomb hits.

1083
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,760
 They had no time to prepare.

1084
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,560
 They had no time to arm themselves

1085
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,320
 and they are losing because they weren't ready

1086
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,720
 and they couldn't have predicted it.

1087
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,560
 The same with us.

1088
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,400
 If you're not waking up every day,

1089
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,960
 Ephesians six, putting on the armor of God,

1090
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,720
 not praying, asking the Holy Spirit to lead you,

1091
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,840
 to guide you, to convict you and walking proactively,

1092
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,760
 it's gonna be too late because the war is coming,

1093
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,640
 whether you want it to or not.

1094
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,000
 And I always say, no one runs into the battle unarmed.

1095
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,760
 And so when you make that choice, like you're talking about,

1096
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,280
 when you make that choice to not get up every single day,

1097
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,240
 put on that armor, grab the weapon, the sword,

1098
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,480
 grab people, other fellow people

1099
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,000
 going to the fight with you.

1100
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,280
 And then ultimately following and trusting the commander,

1101
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,200
 the Lord, I mean, you're gonna fall.

1102
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,040
 - Totally.

1103
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,160
 - And so I just, I would say for me,

1104
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,880
 one myth that I just wanna speak against really quick

1105
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,480
 that I think is people look at people like us

1106
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,480
 and they almost make it like we're really far off

1107
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,160
 and that we don't get it.

1108
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,880
 Like we don't have a flesh that wars every day.

1109
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,800
 And I always tell people, I'm like,

1110
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,720
 if only you knew how much I am getting tempted

1111
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,320
 and how much the enemy is whispering in my ear

1112
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,280
 and wanting me, he wants me just to fall one time

1113
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,040
 to ruin everything.

1114
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,400
 That I, and it, the goodness that there is

1115
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,620
 that God's grace abounds, but I'm saying, you know.

1116
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,800
 - There's no division between pastor and person out there.

1117
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
 - It just keeps, it's the rest of your life.

1118
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
 So you gotta be proactive.

1119
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,040
 - Here's what else is crazy.

1120
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,520
 So we're, we'll hang here just one more minute.

1121
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
 - Yeah.

1122
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,560
 - Again, you know where to go.

1123
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,840
 Is I feel like we've gotten to rub shoulders

1124
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,360
 with just people, incredible pastors,

1125
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,660
 like well-known people throughout the years

1126
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,240
 who are leading incredible ministries around the country.

1127
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,600
 And what was almost surprising to me,

1128
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,940
 it sounds crazy to say that.

1129
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,880
 And I'm hesitating to mention names here,

1130
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,520
 but I bet a lot of our audience would know

1131
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,360
 who those names are.

1132
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,680
 Godly men, well-known people.

1133
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,880
 Every single one of them has to do this as well.

1134
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,720
 - Yeah.

1135
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,560
 - Like you would think like, oh man, you're your ex person.

1136
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,480
 You have to do that?

1137
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,680
 You figured it out.

1138
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,400
 - Yeah, you figured, no, all of them,

1139
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,240
 every single one of them.

1140
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,720
 And anytime someone falls, like I'm never surprised.

1141
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,600
 People are always like shocked that somebody fell

1142
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,320
 or made a mistake, had a moral failure.

1143
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,720
 And I'm like, dude, are you kidding me?

1144
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,300
 They still have a sin nature.

1145
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,240
 The thing that comes naturally to them every single day

1146
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,120
 is moral failure.

1147
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
 Thing that comes naturally to all of us.

1148
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,120
 And so anytime we don't go to war daily

1149
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,400
 and moment by moment or are thoughtful

1150
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,240
 and intentional and careful,

1151
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,080
 I have to crucify, I can't let this run me.

1152
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,560
 The thing that runs in neutral is a sin nature.

1153
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,800
 And every person, you never escape that.

1154
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,600
 And those guys, if there's anything worth respecting

1155
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,160
 about anybody of any significant platform in Christianity,

1156
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,440
 it involves them daily crucifying their flesh.

1157
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,280
 And--

1158
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,100
 - Just like anyone.

1159
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,400
 - Just like anyone, exactly.

1160
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,300
 So, all right, so first thing that we see

1161
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,720
 is that you can't win the battle, I'm sorry.

1162
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,680
 First thing that we see is that you can't change the past,

1163
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,400
 but you can alter the future.

1164
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,740
 Second thing, if you can't win the battle,

1165
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,680
 if you are unwilling to fight.

1166
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,520
 And number three--

1167
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,340
 - Take us home.

1168
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,760
 - You can't see the full story God is writing.

1169
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,320
 This seems the most abstract and like,

1170
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,520
 duh, I can't see, are you too?

1171
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,480
 Oh, I can't see everything that God's doing.

1172
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,320
 Wow.

1173
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,240
 - Gotta trust him.

1174
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,140
 - Here's what I think is profound.

1175
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,280
 Because in the midst of the confusion,

1176
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,840
 it can seem like God is absent.

1177
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,800
 What is he doing?

1178
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,880
 What is he up to?

1179
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,600
 And for most of us, not most of us, all of us,

1180
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,760
 you just can't see the full picture

1181
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,160
 about what God is doing.

1182
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,680
 You know, your dad passing away,

1183
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,760
 a few years ago, you have no idea all the ways

1184
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,560
 that God has used that and is,

1185
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,560
 you know, I'm confident you've seen some of the ways,

1186
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,880
 but all of the different ways that God is,

1187
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,020
 at the end of time, you're gonna see like, wow,

1188
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,400
 I had no idea this person's life,

1189
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,440
 and this person's life, and this person's life.

1190
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,980
 - My dad got to meet his long lost daughter

1191
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,520
 because of his cancer,

1192
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,860
 and got to lead her and her husband to Jesus.

1193
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,860
 - So if you could see that in this side of heaven,

1194
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,620
 think about all the ways that we'll be able to someday

1195
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,680
 see the bigger picture of what God is writing.

1196
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,960
 And if you and I pause,

1197
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,120
 and you just look around at the day circumstances

1198
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,440
 or where you are in this moment,

1199
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,020
 you'll be tempted to go, where the heck,

1200
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,800
 God is clearly not at work, he's clearly not in this.

1201
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,840
 Here's where this comes from the story.

1202
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,360
 If Esther had stopped in the midst of the story,

1203
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,080
 and hit pause at so many different places,

1204
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,000
 you've been like, where, what is God doing?

1205
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,040
 Where is he in the story?

1206
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,240
 Like, what do I mean by that?

1207
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,360
 Think about if she had stopped whenever her parents died,

1208
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,840
 'cause remember, she was an orphan.

1209
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,680
 She buried both of her parents,

1210
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,800
 had to move in with her uncle Mordecai,

1211
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,120
 that's Uncle Jesse, in the city of Susa,

1212
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,320
 some place far away.

1213
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,080
 Had she stopped and gone like, my parents are dead.

1214
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,360
 I'm a young girl, I'm an orphan.

1215
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,500
 Where is God?

1216
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,160
 If she had just stopped at that part of the story,

1217
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,240
 she wouldn't have been able to see the bigger picture

1218
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,560
 and the amazing ways God was still at work

1219
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,040
 despite the brokenness of her circumstances.

1220
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,760
 Had she stopped when she was forced

1221
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,840
 to be a part of the bachelor Persia,

1222
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,640
 and basically every beautiful girl in the empire

1223
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,880
 was ripped out of their home

1224
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,240
 and put to be property of the king

1225
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,600
 unless they won the competition,

1226
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
 and then they could be the queen.

1227
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,680
 She would have been like, where,

1228
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,000
 how is God a part of this at all?

1229
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,680
 Had she stopped when Mordecai, her uncle,

1230
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,720
 stopped a murder or assassination attempt

1231
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,560
 on the king's life.

1232
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,280
 There was a hit, there was people trying to kill the king,

1233
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,400
 murdered, or Mordecai discovered it,

1234
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,480
 and he uncovered it for the king and he saved his life.

1235
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,720
 And the king did nothing to reward him for five years.

1236
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,320
 Had you stopped, you'd be like, what,

1237
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,920
 especially because the guy who gets rewarded

1238
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,000
 one verse later after Mordecai does that

1239
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,760
 is Haman, the evil and wicked,

1240
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,840
 one who would try to kill all the Jewish people,

1241
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,080
 all the people of God.

1242
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,560
 You're like, where is God?

1243
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,160
 How could God clearly be at work?

1244
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,080
 When Haman was promoted to prime minister,

1245
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,040
 the most evil person who wants to kill everybody

1246
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,420
 is now made the highest officer in the land.

1247
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,600
 You'd go, where's God at work?

1248
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,520
 When he convinces the king to kill all the Jewish people,

1249
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,120
 when he stops, when he makes a pole of death

1250
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,200
 for Mordecai to die on and he goes to Haman and kill,

1251
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
 you'd be like, what is God doing?

1252
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,880
 And yet you couldn't see the full story

1253
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,480
 that God was writing.

1254
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,040
 And there was a reversal that came,

1255
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,720
 and none of us can see all the story

1256
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,960
 and all the ways that God is writing

1257
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,600
 in the bigger picture of our life

1258
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,960
 and how he's using the fact that you lost that job

1259
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,640
 and you ended up having to move that city

1260
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,440
 or that relationship broke up or your parents ended up,

1261
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,280
 somebody, a loved one ended up dying from cancer

1262
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,760
 or somebody had coronavirus.

1263
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,400
 Someone you know has coronavirus.

1264
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,360
 You can't see if God is using all of this

1265
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,920
 'cause he's still at work and we can't see the big picture,

1266
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,040
 but we can trust him and he's working it for good.

1267
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,120
 Let me show you a parallel.

1268
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,480
 Here's what's crazy about the book of Esther.

1269
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,320
 And I think the guys have this.

1270
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,840
 All throughout the book, you can see,

1271
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,080
 like what is beautiful,

1272
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,840
 it's an incredible piece of literature

1273
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,000
 because there's like a big word for it.

1274
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,760
 I won't give it 'cause it'll just confuse people.

1275
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,200
 I call it just parallels,

1276
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,200
 where it starts with a party full of pagans.

1277
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,120
 You remember that the first week

1278
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,680
 where it's like, they're all getting crazy drunk

1279
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,600
 and the king told his first wife,

1280
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,280
 "Hey, come in here, dance naked."

1281
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,520
 And she was like, "No."

1282
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,400
 He's like, "All right, you're no longer my wife then."

1283
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,680
 So it starts with a party.

1284
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,560
 It ends with a party with the people of God.

1285
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,160
 Starts with a party full of pagans.

1286
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,120
 It ends with a party with the people of God.

1287
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,120
 It starts with Esther identifying as a Gentile,

1288
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,560
 hiding her Jewishness.

1289
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,880
 And it ends with Jewish people

1290
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,520
 or Gentiles identifying and becoming Jews.

1291
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,200
 The third chapter has the elevation of Haman,

1292
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,560
 the evil person.

1293
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,120
 It ends with the elevation of Mordecai.

1294
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,680
 It involves a anti-Jewish,

1295
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,560
 every Jewish person has gotta give up their life,

1296
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,840
 is gonna lose their life.

1297
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,880
 And it ends with the Jewish people

1298
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,200
 protecting their lives and being victorious.

1299
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,880
 It involves a banquet with Queen Esther

1300
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,000
 and then there's another banquet.

1301
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,440
 And it all pivots around this royal procession of Mordecai

1302
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,640
 where he was kind of led throughout the streets.

1303
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,840
 Remember that Prince Ali, fabulous he moment,

1304
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,360
 where Haman had to walk him around,

1305
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,680
 basically celebrate,

1306
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,760
 this is the guy that King really loves that saved him.

1307
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,680
 But in the midst of all that,

1308
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,080
 God took everything messed up and broken

1309
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,880
 and the whole story communicates this.

1310
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,240
 And he redeems it and he reverses it

1311
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,320
 and he's at work in the midst of it.

1312
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,480
 And the whole portrait of Esther is a reminder to you

1313
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,240
 and to me that God is at work when I can't see it,

1314
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,300
 when it doesn't make sense,

1315
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,800
 when it doesn't even look like it.

1316
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,400
 Like Corona, what is God doing in the midst of Corona?

1317
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,920
 I don't know.

1318
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,800
 I don't know all the ways,

1319
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,760
 but here's some ways that I do know he's working.

1320
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,440
 I do know that last week because of Corona virus,

1321
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,240
 somebody stumbled onto the porch live stream

1322
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,760
 and they trusted in Christ, they trusted Jesus.

1323
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,080
 And it happened the week before that as well,

1324
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,960
 that people that wouldn't have been listening normally

1325
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,480
 found somehow the stream and God saves their life.

1326
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,040
 I know that all over the country,

1327
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,920
 the church is rising up and in community after community,

1328
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,780
 there's Christians who are going around

1329
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,560
 and they're bringing, delivering food

1330
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,160
 to people who have health problems or are elderly,

1331
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,440
 and they're getting a chance to be the body of Christ

1332
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,480
 in a unique way.

1333
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,800
 I know that people are searching and looking for God.

1334
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,700
 They're in the midst of this going,

1335
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,160
 I've been stripped of so much security

1336
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,560
 and they're open to talking about their faith right now.

1337
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,600
 So I don't know all the ways,

1338
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,840
 but I do know that he's at work.

1339
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,120
 And those are just some of the ways

1340
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,320
 that he's clearly at work all around us.

1341
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,000
 And I don't know what you're walking through

1342
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,560
 and I don't know what you're facing.

1343
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,880
 And I don't wanna even pretend

1344
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,080
 that some explanation I could give right now

1345
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,320
 would completely satisfy that.

1346
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,840
 But I do know the message of the book of Esther,

1347
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,560
 of the Bible, is that God has promised

1348
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,560
 to work all of those things

1349
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,140
 and to take the most broken, horrific things

1350
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,760
 and bring about good.

1351
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,440
 He did it most fully on the cross with Jesus,

1352
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,360
 dying on the cross.

1353
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,440
 The worst day in human history

1354
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,120
 was the greatest day in human history

1355
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,000
 where Jesus, God himself, who became a man,

1356
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,280
 was crucified and died for you and me.

1357
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,720
 And that day that was the worst day in history

1358
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,300
 is also the greatest day because it allowed you and I

1359
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,840
 to receive forgiveness of sins

1360
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,440
 by simply putting our faith in him.

1361
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,920
 Romans chapter eight, verse 28 to 31 says,

1362
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,400
 and we know that in all things,

1363
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,840
 God works for the good of those who love him,

1364
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,120
 who've been called according to his purpose.

1365
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,200
 For those God foreknew,

1366
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,480
 he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son,

1367
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,600
 that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.

1368
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,520
 Those he predestined, he also called.

1369
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,240
 Those he called, he also justified.

1370
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,800
 Those he justified, he also glorified.

1371
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,260
 What then should we say in response to these things?

1372
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,820
 If God is for us, who can be against us?

1373
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,740
 Paul says, no matter what we walk through,

1374
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,860
 as a Christian, we know that God has promised

1375
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,620
 he's gonna weave everything to good,

1376
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,620
 everything together for good.

1377
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,160
 Let me say two last things.

1378
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,540
 I bought a puzzle recently.

1379
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,860
 It's a 500 piece puzzle.

1380
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,140
 I was like, we're gonna do this as a family.

1381
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,980
 It's gonna be so fun.

1382
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,380
 It's gonna be awesome.

1383
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,640
 And have you ever done like a big puzzle?

1384
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,480
 - Yeah.

1385
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,240
 - So I didn't realize how many pieces 500 pieces was.

1386
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,160
 - Yeah, it's been a long time.

1387
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,240
 - Oh, dude, I was like,

1388
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,960
 I thought a four year old was gonna do it with me.

1389
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,920
 Like, this is gonna be so fun.

1390
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,000
 We're gonna be bonding.

1391
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,360
 And he had no idea.

1392
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,520
 It was like this safari puzzle

1393
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,580
 and just the tiny little pieces and where they all fit.

1394
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,080
 And so it ended up being like this thing

1395
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,960
 that I will do as a family that I just did

1396
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,040
 because I couldn't let my pride get in the way of like,

1397
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,800
 oh, I'm gonna finish this thing, don't worry.

1398
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,120
 And so it became like the thing that I did

1399
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,000
 for like six Saturdays in a row during nap time.

1400
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,920
 Just 'cause I couldn't let the gift the best of me.

1401
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,360
 And just as I think about that,

1402
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,240
 I was constantly going like,

1403
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,920
 where does this piece fit into the bigger picture?

1404
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,240
 Like, how does this all fit together?

1405
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,440
 And if you were to give me like a 5,000 piece puzzle

1406
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,520
 or a 50 million piece puzzle,

1407
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,220
 I would have gone, there's no way I could ever

1408
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,020
 with the lifetime figure it all out.

1409
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,720
 God is the one over all of our lives

1410
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,740
 and all the brokenness in our world

1411
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,100
 who has promised that he's taking all these puzzle pieces

1412
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,280
 that we have no idea, no ability to figure out

1413
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,360
 how do they all fit together?

1414
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,880
 And he's promised I'm working them

1415
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,780
 and fitting them in to a bigger picture

1416
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,120
 you can't see right now, but one day you will.

1417
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,240
 And one day all the pieces will begin to make sense.

1418
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,540
 And in the meantime, you can trust me.

1419
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,560
 And the story of Esther was that, hey, you can trust me.

1420
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,200
 I'm working and I'm going to bring good about.

1421
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,160
 And I don't know who's walking through a situation right now

1422
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,900
 where you just need to be reminded of that.

1423
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,700
 And you need just a moment where you just declare to God,

1424
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,680
 will you help me to believe that?

1425
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,920
 I don't know where this puzzle piece

1426
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,140
 that I'm holding right now fits and I need your help.

1427
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,400
 And the God is there wants you to come to him

1428
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,240
 and call on him.

1429
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,940
 Finally, just as we finished this book,

1430
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,640
 what I think is remarkable about the story

1431
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,900
 is there's parallels to Jesus in the story.

1432
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,180
 In Luke chapter 24,

1433
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,160
 do you know what I'm talking about Luke chapter 24?

1434
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,560
 The road to...

1435
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,840
 - The mask, oh no, not the mask.

1436
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,000
 - No, you're close, close.

1437
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,920
 Road to Emmaus.

1438
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,760
 - Emmaus.

1439
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,280
 - Jesus is on the road to Emmaus and he has a conversation.

1440
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,000
 Yeah, it's a weird road.

1441
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,480
 And on the road, he's talking with two of these disciples

1442
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,160
 and just for the point of being brief, he basically says,

1443
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,000
 hey, everything in the prophets and the old Testament

1444
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,200
 and the scriptures was about me.

1445
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,040
 You knew that, right?

1446
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,520
 It was all pointing to the fact that a Messiah would come,

1447
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,400
 he would be crucified, he would give his life

1448
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,040
 and he would save his people.

1449
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,160
 All of it, including the book of Esther.

1450
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,120
 How does Esther point to Jesus?

1451
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,000
 Well, in so many ways, we see Jesus is a better Esther.

1452
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,500
 Esther risked her physical life

1453
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,880
 to save her people from physical death.

1454
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,920
 Jesus gave his life to save not her people,

1455
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,440
 but all people from eternal death.

1456
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,160
 Esther left her poverty for the palace.

1457
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:13,560
 Jesus left the palace of heaven for the poverty of earth.

1458
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,540
 Esther appealed to the king

1459
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,600
 to rescue her people from destruction.

1460
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,040
 Jesus appealed to God, the father,

1461
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,840
 to rescue us from sin's destruction.

1462
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,920
 Esther entered the palace uninvited by the king.

1463
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,780
 Jesus entered into our world unwelcomed by his people.

1464
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,920
 Esther fought against an evil enemy, Haman.

1465
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,360
 Christ defeated once and for all

1466
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,800
 the ultimate evil enemy, Satan.

1467
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,240
 Esther boldly identified herself with God's people

1468
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,520
 to spare their lives.

1469
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:44,320
 Jesus identified himself with humanity to spare our lives.

1470
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,840
 Esther saved God's people,

1471
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,820
 spread across one nation in one generation.

1472
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,880
 Jesus saved God's people

1473
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,840
 from every nation and every generation.

1474
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,480
 The whole book and ultimately the whole story

1475
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,260
 of the Bible points to Jesus.

1476
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,920
 And I just wanna share one last time

1477
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,960
 for anyone listening,

1478
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,440
 'cause just like last week and the week before,

1479
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,880
 there's been people who tune in

1480
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,720
 who have never put their faith in Jesus.

1481
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,160
 You've never had a moment in your life where you said,

1482
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,960
 "I believe not that I'm a good enough person

1483
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,540
 "to go to heaven, or not that because I'm so bad,

1484
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,700
 "God wouldn't want anything to do with me,

1485
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,840
 "but I believe that Jesus on the cross died for my sin.

1486
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,600
 "He paid for all of it.

1487
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,860
 "And if I'm gonna have a relationship with God,

1488
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,500
 "it's gonna be because I receive his free gift

1489
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,920
 "in giving his life for me to have eternal life."

1490
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,320
 And he was buried and he rose from the dead,

1491
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,600
 and it changed the world.

1492
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,120
 It reset the calendar, it redefined existence.

1493
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,560
 And it is ultimately not what the story of Esther about alone

1494
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,120
 but what your life and all of life is about.

1495
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,280
 And God hasn't forgotten you.

1496
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,120
 He loves you.

1497
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,000
 He cares about you.

1498
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,720
 He's at work in the midst of all of this.

1499
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,840
 And maybe you're sitting right now listening

1500
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,840
 and you're locked in at home and under quarantine.

1501
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,480
 And one of the reasons God wants you to be there

1502
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,160
 is 'cause he wants you to know he loves you.

1503
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,880
 He gave his life to prove it.

1504
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,400
 And if you will trust in that message and in Jesus,

1505
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,120
 you'll receive eternal life.

1506
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,160
 And not just experience the God who saved the queen,

1507
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,160
 but God who saves you and I

1508
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,600
 and all people who call on him.

1509
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,440
 - So good.

1510
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,760
 - So let me pray.

1511
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,860
 And then we're gonna do one last worship song.

1512
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:16,860
 Father, thank you that you have been at work

1513
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,700
 since the beginning of time.

1514
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,000
 You're working right now all around us.

1515
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
 And you are the same God who saved the people

1516
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,720
 of the Jewish nation 500 years before Jesus was around

1517
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,480
 through Esther and Mordecai.

1518
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,600
 And you're the same God who saved

1519
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,720
 so many of us listening right now

1520
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,360
 by putting our faith in you.

1521
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,480
 And so I do pray for anyone

1522
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,400
 who's never had that moment.

1523
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,360
 Tonight would be their night.

1524
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,800
 I pray for friends that are struggling financially

1525
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,780
 and anxious.

1526
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,440
 They're anxious because of challenges that they're facing.

1527
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,920
 You'd meet them where they're at.

1528
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,960
 They'd have other believers in their life

1529
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,380
 to generously provide for needs.

1530
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,560
 I pray for anyone who's affected directly

1531
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,960
 in terms of their health with the coronavirus

1532
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,440
 that you would meet them right there where they're at.

1533
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,200
 They'd have amazing recovery in front of them

1534
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,100
 and the body of Christ caring for them and around them.

1535
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,120
 Thank you, Lord.

1536
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:14,480
 The same God who was at work

1537
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,060
 even when we couldn't see and understand it

1538
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,900
 is still at work even when we can't see and understand it.

1539
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,020
 And that he loves us and gave his life for us.

1540
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,780
 We love you and we worship you now in song.

1541
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,620
 In Christ's name, amen.

1542
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,460
 - Amen.
