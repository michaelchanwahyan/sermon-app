00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,320
 What's up, Porch?

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,360
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,960
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,160
 Hey, my name is Timothy Atik, and I'm

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,640
 one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark Community Church.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,240
 It is so great to get to be here with you tonight.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,440
 Definitely want to give a shout out to the PorchLive locations

9
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,680
 of Indianapolis, Boise, and Fort Worth, Texas.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,040
 Hope that all is well with you guys.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,360
 It's good to be right here with those in Dallas.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,640
 We are continuing the His and Hers series.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,880
 I want to start just by sharing with you that my wife and I,

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,520
 we got married on October 14, 2006,

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,200
 which means we are old people.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
 But we had an incredible wedding,

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,640
 and we had an incredible first year of marriage.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,760
 The beauty of getting married is that you

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,240
 get to invite all of your friends,

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
 and they are required to bring you a gift.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,340
 Not only that, you get to tell them what they have to buy you.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,880
 You register, and they're obligated.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,800
 And it's a great thing.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,720
 And so a bunch of people gathered in Wichita Falls, Texas

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 for our wedding.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,800
 And I'm half Palestinian, which means

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,120
 we had a Middle Eastern flair to our wedding.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,520
 So if you've ever seen movies or videos of Middle Eastern

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
 weddings with people flying in the air in chairs, that was us.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,720
 Catherine and I were in chairs, in the air.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,520
 The Arabs of the wedding circled up.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,080
 My cousin magically appeared with a drum.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,520
 He was playing the drum.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,600
 We were circled up.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
 It was dancing.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,040
 It was great.

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,600
 My wife's little sister, who was in high school at the time,

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,960
 brought her high school friends, and they all left saying,

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,880
 I want to marry an Egyptian.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,240
 I'm not Egyptian.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,040
 I hope that worked out for them.

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,720
 But that's how good our wedding was.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
 And then after we got married, we

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,920
 went to St. Lucia for our honeymoon, which was amazing.

45
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,680
 And then we just played really hard for our first year.

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,600
 We went to Puerto Rico, and Italy, and California,

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,640
 and Florida.

48
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,320
 And we played so hard that we gained the marriage 15.

49
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,560
 If you remember the freshman 15 from college

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,880
 where you eat so much that you gain 15 pounds,

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,560
 well, when I applied for life insurance

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,960
 during our first year of marriage,

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,320
 I had to check the box for excessive weight gain

54
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,080
 because our first year of marriage was that good.

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,480
 And even to this day, we just celebrate

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,360
 our 16-year anniversary.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
 I love marriage.

58
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,840
 I love being married.

59
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,760
 I have a great wife.

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,080
 Catherine is amazing.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,540
 But here's what I haven't told you.

62
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,880
 I haven't told you about the time

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,400
 that my wife threw a blanket at me

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,560
 because she was so mad in our first fight

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,600
 about where we were going to spend the holidays.

66
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,720
 That was a huge issue in our house.

67
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,080
 I haven't told you about the fight

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,980
 that we had in public in the Austin airport

69
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,040
 as we were flying to San Diego for our one-year anniversary.

70
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,800
 Like, I haven't told you about those times

71
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,080
 because when you who are single,

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,200
 which is the majority of you in this room

73
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,600
 or you're dating, when you think about marriage,

74
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,200
 and statistics would say that marriage is important

75
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,960
 to about 80 to 90% of you in the room,

76
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,360
 when you think about marriage,

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
 most likely you only think about the good times.

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,960
 Like, does anyone here dream about fighting

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
 with your future spouse?

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,200
 Any girls, like, I just can't wait to fight with him.

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,320
 It's gonna be amazing.

82
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,120
 No one dreams of that day.

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,800
 Anyone longing to get into marriage

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,880
 and then wish that you were no longer married,

85
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,600
 anyone think about that?

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,800
 Anyone dream about a day

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,480
 when you could feel stuck in your marriage

88
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,480
 or that you could be married and feel lonely?

89
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,980
 No, we don't think about that.

90
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,240
 And so that's one of the reasons

91
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,400
 that we're doing this series, His and Hers,

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
 because the reality is it's easy

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,200
 to find the wrong dating relationship

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,480
 that leads to the wrong marriage.

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,280
 Our hope is that you'd find the right dating relationship

96
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,000
 that would lead to the right marriage.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,960
 And so the first week of this series,

98
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,880
 David just talked about three signs

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,120
 that you're not ready to date.

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,840
 And then last week he gave us 10 keys

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,760
 to uncomplicating dating.

102
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,320
 Tonight what I wanna do is I wanna give you six questions

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
 that will hopefully save your marriage

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,880
 before it ever begins.

105
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,720
 That's my hope tonight.

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,760
 So if you have a Bible,

107
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,160
 I wanna invite you to join me in the Song of Solomon,

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,840
 the Song of Songs, chapter one.

109
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,720
 As you're turning there, if you're like,

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,680
 I don't know what he just said, okay?

111
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,040
 The Song of Songs is a book

112
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,960
 in the middle of the Old Testament of your Bible.

113
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,840
 Don't be afraid to use the table of contents.

114
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,680
 And the reason that we're turning there tonight

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,680
 is that Song of Solomon is basically God's instruction manual

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,200
 for romantic love.

117
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,160
 It is all about finding love,

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,320
 making love, and maintaining love.

119
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,160
 It gives us God's design for relationships

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,120
 between men and women.

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,140
 And so if there's any place that we should look,

122
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,680
 we should look to the Song of Solomon

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,680
 because God hasn't just tossed us marriage

124
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,920
 and said, figure it out.

125
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,000
 No, he actually gives us an instruction manual for it.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,080
 Now, I wanna be clear,

127
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,800
 tonight isn't just a talk about marriage.

128
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,480
 So if you are single, this talk is especially for you.

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,680
 If you are dating, this talk is for you.

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
 If you are engaged, this talk is for you.

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,560
 I wanna give you six questions from the Song of Solomon

132
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,920
 that will save your marriage before it begins.

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,320
 If you're looking with me at the Song of Solomon,

134
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,000
 we're gonna start in chapter one, verse one.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,960
 Now, if you've never read the book before,

136
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,160
 what you need to know is that it is God's ideal for love.

137
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
 And so you see a man and a woman

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,640
 just journeying through life together.

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,720
 And so you see them in different phases

140
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,760
 of their relationship.

141
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,440
 You see them before marriage.

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
 You see them getting married.

143
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,320
 You get to be a creeper in the honeymoon suite

144
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,740
 when they have sex on their first night of marriage.

145
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,960
 You see them into marriage fighting.

146
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,360
 You see them having sex many years into marriage.

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
 It's that kind of book.

148
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,840
 Like God put that in, he put it in the Bible.

149
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,520
 So just watch how it starts out.

150
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,360
 Verse one, chapter one.

151
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,520
 It's the girl and guy talking back and forth to each other.

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,760
 I'm gonna just tell you the girl talks more than the guy.

153
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,960
 Like the Bible gets us.

154
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
 That's just the way it is.

155
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,680
 It's science, okay?

156
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
 Here we go.

157
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,720
 Verse one, it says, "The song of songs, which is Solomon's."

158
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
 The song of songs, that's a superlative.

159
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,160
 It's like saying that Jesus is the Lord of all lords.

160
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,640
 Solomon was a songwriter.

161
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
 He wrote over a thousand songs.

162
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,480
 When it says the song of songs,

163
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,760
 it's saying that this is his greatest hit.

164
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,640
 "The song of songs, which is Solomon's."

165
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
 Watch verse two.

166
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,180
 This is a girl talking.

167
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,720
 "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth."

168
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,900
 This is the Bible, people.

169
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,080
 This is the way this book goes.

170
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,240
 "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,

171
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,200
 for your love is better than wine."

172
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,240
 Now watch this, verse three.

173
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,680
 "Your anointing oils are fragrant.

174
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,480
 Your name is oil poured out."

175
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,400
 The first question that I wanna encourage you to ask

176
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,640
 that will save your marriage before it begins is this.

177
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,560
 How do you both smell?

178
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
 Okay, you didn't see that coming, did you?

179
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,360
 Some of you are like, "I just came from the gym.

180
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
 I already feel like a failure."

181
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,740
 Like, that's okay.

182
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,480
 But the first question is, how do you both smell?

183
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,240
 That's a question that you should ask

184
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,840
 when you start dating someone,

185
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,860
 but you should ask that question individually

186
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,120
 about yourself right now.

187
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,120
 If you're single, how do you smell?

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,900
 Where am I getting that from?

189
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,640
 Well, did you see what she said?

190
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,520
 She said, "Your anointing oils are fragrant."

191
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,320
 What you need to know is in the ancient Near East,

192
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,560
 when the song of Solomon was written,

193
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320
 they didn't have water on tap.

194
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,840
 Taking a shower every day, it wasn't a thing.

195
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,260
 And so men would mask their natural musk

196
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,380
 by using oils and fragrances.

197
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,280
 Some of you guys are like, "The Bible

198
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,440
 has never made more sense to me than right now."

199
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,480
 Because you're like the two people

200
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,400
 still using Axe body spray,

201
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,220
 and you've believed the lie

202
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,560
 that Axe is a shower replacement

203
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,440
 instead of a shower enhancement, okay?

204
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,120
 2009 called and they want their body spray back, but...

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
 (congregation laughing)

206
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
 The reality is she's saying,

207
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,400
 "Look, this guy, he looks good and he smells good."

208
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,880
 But then she turns the corner and what does she say?

209
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
 She says, "Your name," and in the Hebrew,

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,560
 when that word name is used, it's a reference to character.

211
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,440
 It's a reference to his entire being.

212
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,360
 So she's saying, "Your entire being is oil poured out."

213
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,580
 So she switches from the physical smell of his body

214
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,320
 to the metaphorical smell of his being or his character.

215
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,840
 She's saying, "You smell good inside and out."

216
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,380
 So it's just good to ask the question,

217
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,080
 like when your name is mentioned,

218
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
 what fragrance is in the air?

219
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,040
 Like if someone mentioned your name,

220
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,040
 would you be proud for that name to be associated with you?

221
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
 Wait, that didn't make sense.

222
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,000
 Let me run that back.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,880
 Okay, rewind.

224
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
 If your name is mentioned,

225
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,020
 will people be proud that you are dating their friend?

226
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,500
 So like what fragrance is in the air

227
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,460
 when your name is mentioned?

228
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,060
 Some of you are like, "Man, that makes me feel

229
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,980
 "like a failure because I have a tough past."

230
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,340
 Hey, I just wanna be clear from the start.

231
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,300
 Jesus Christ is in the business

232
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,260
 of giving clean starts to messy lives.

233
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,220
 So you are not defined by your past.

234
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,980
 And at the same time, I'm just talking about

235
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,400
 right now where you're at.

236
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,240
 How do you smell?

237
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,080
 Let me give you a vision for what you want, okay?

238
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,960
 I've got three crazy boys, Noah, Andrew, and Jake.

239
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,400
 Noah, my oldest, who's 13 now,

240
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,280
 he was the first grandchild on either side of our families,

241
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,640
 which means he got more attention

242
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,840
 than any other grandkid has gotten.

243
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,240
 At the first Christmas, I rarely got to hold my own son

244
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,360
 because he was always being held by one of his grandparents.

245
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,660
 And so the rare occasions that I did get to hold Noah,

246
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,540
 after two seconds of holding him,

247
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,100
 I would get this whiff of old lady perfume

248
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,120
 because it was clear that he had been spending time

249
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,500
 with either Tata or Nana.

250
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,140
 That's what you want.

251
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,380
 When you get around someone,

252
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
 it should only take a couple seconds

253
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,660
 before you get a whiff of Jesus in their lives.

254
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,300
 And when someone gets around you,

255
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,400
 it shouldn't take long before they begin

256
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,000
 to smell Jesus in your life.

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
 Well, how do you smell like Jesus?

258
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,560
 Well, smelling like Jesus is what naturally happens

259
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,480
 when a guy or a girl surrenders their life to Jesus Christ.

260
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880
 You come to a place where you recognize

261
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,880
 that Jesus Christ is Savior of the world

262
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
 and he is actually King, and he's a good King.

263
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
 What do kings do?

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,360
 They rule.

265
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,000
 And so you've come to a place in your life

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,080
 where you just have realized,

267
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,720
 I want Jesus Christ to be in charge.

268
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,600
 I want him to rule in my life.

269
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,780
 And when you know Jesus, you know what happens?

270
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,520
 The Spirit of God comes and lives inside of you.

271
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,040
 And as you surrender each day to the Spirit at work in you,

272
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,040
 the Spirit of God begins to shape you into Christ-likeness.

273
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,840
 And as you begin to look more like Jesus,

274
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,240
 you begin to naturally smell like Jesus.

275
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
 This is what happens when you surrender to God.

276
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
 This is what happens when the Spirit

277
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
 is at work in your life.

278
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
 This is what happens when an individual

279
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,800
 begins to read the Word of God,

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,480
 because you can't know God's Word without knowing his,

281
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,800
 you can't know God's ways without knowing his Word.

282
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
 So when you take this Word to heart,

283
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,480
 when you get connected with other believers,

284
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,120
 and you live in open, honest relationships

285
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,840
 with one another, and people begin to encourage you,

286
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,960
 you know what happens is you begin to smell

287
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,640
 as if you've been around Jesus.

288
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,740
 That is what you want.

289
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,280
 Our tendency is to minimize the importance

290
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,020
 of someone recognizing Jesus as Lord.

291
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,600
 If we're not careful, we'll make God just a box to check

292
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,400
 when it comes to dating.

293
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 So it's like, well, I think I saw him at the porch.

294
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,000
 We went on a date and she mentioned church,

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
 so I'm sure that they're good, so check on that.

296
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
 Do we like laughing together?

297
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,320
 I think we like the same music.

298
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,600
 We're both really ambitious, so I think that we're good.

299
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
 No, let's be clear.

300
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,160
 I'm gonna tell you what my good friend Greg Mott told me.

301
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,880
 There's a huge difference between a Christian boy

302
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,640
 and a godly man.

303
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,000
 There's a big difference between a Christian girl

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,140
 and a godly woman.

305
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,480
 Okay, godly men and godly women smell

306
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,800
 as if they've been around Jesus.

307
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,720
 So let me ask you just some very specific questions, okay?

308
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 If you wanna know if you smell like Jesus,

309
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,880
 then answer this question.

310
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 Do you right now smell more of conviction or compromise?

311
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,760
 What do those words mean?

312
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,740
 What I mean by conviction is I mean you care more

313
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,140
 about God's ways than other people's opinions.

314
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,580
 And when I talk about compromise,

315
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,700
 I'm talking about settling for less

316
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,640
 than God's standards for you.

317
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,360
 So do you smell more of conviction or compromise?

318
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
 Does the person that you're interested in

319
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
 or the person that you're dating

320
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,840
 or the person that you're engaged to,

321
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,200
 do they smell of conviction or compromise?

322
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,480
 So just think about this.

323
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,180
 It's easy to smell like Jesus on a Tuesday night,

324
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,740
 and it's easy to smell like Jesus on a Sunday morning,

325
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,800
 but how does he or she smell

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,340
 on Thursday, Friday, Saturday night?

327
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,740
 How does she smell at happy hour with coworkers?

328
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,100
 Okay, if he will make you babysit him when he is drunk,

329
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,220
 when else will you have to babysit him?

330
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,420
 Okay, if he or she will cuss around you,

331
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,460
 they'll probably cuss around your kids.

332
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,320
 If he or she will cheat at work,

333
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,220
 that means that they're fine cheating.

334
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,540
 How are they, how do they interact

335
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,580
 with people of the opposite sex?

336
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,460
 If they're known as a player,

337
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,980
 what makes you think they're not playing you?

338
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,100
 So you just wanna ask the question,

339
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,660
 do they smell more of conviction or compromise?

340
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,060
 Do you smell more of conviction or compromise?

341
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,100
 If you're sitting there saying,

342
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,240
 I kinda feel like I smell of compromise,

343
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,180
 you know what, Jesus can freshen you up really quickly.

344
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,220
 He's that good.

345
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,900
 He loves you, and he can pull you in close,

346
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,100
 and he can go to work,

347
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,940
 and he can do a great work in your life.

348
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,940
 I'll ask you, I'll ask you this,

349
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,020
 not just do you smell of conviction or compromise,

350
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,020
 but this, do you smell of faithfulness or flakiness?

351
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,900
 Okay, does he or she smell of faithfulness or flakiness?

352
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,560
 I remember when my wife Kat and I, when we started dating,

353
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,060
 I was just so impressed by her

354
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,160
 because she was a faithful person.

355
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,240
 So she was a sales rep at IBM,

356
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,940
 and all of her coworkers loved her

357
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,240
 because she was a faithful friend at work.

358
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,520
 But then on the weekends, she was invested in her church.

359
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,240
 I still remember pulling up and seeing her sit

360
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,280
 with a small group of high school girls

361
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,560
 that she was investing her life in,

362
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,820
 teaching them the Bible

363
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,440
 because she was faithfully serving her church

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,920
 and investing in the next generation.

365
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
 And then I began to meet Katherine's friends

366
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,280
 because that's the deal, guys.

367
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,200
 If you wanna get with a girl,

368
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,320
 you gotta get with her friends.

369
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,700
 And so when I began,

370
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,540
 that's according to the Spice Girls anyway,

371
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,960
 but when I began to meet her friends,

372
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,280
 here's what was so surprising to me.

373
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,340
 All of Katherine's friends considered Kat their best friend.

374
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,400
 And I was like, that's so amazing.

375
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,960
 Like there are multiple girls

376
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,200
 who look at you as their best friend.

377
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,720
 Why is that?

378
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,560
 She's a faithful friend.

379
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,960
 There is no drama about her.

380
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,440
 Like Katherine exudes joy.

381
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,140
 You just get around her and you feel better about life.

382
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,360
 She's a faithful friend.

383
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,760
 And so I just think about that

384
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,680
 and I'm like, that's what you want.

385
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,880
 You wanna be a faithful person, not a flaky person.

386
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,560
 So can people count on you to do what you say

387
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,800
 that you are going to do?

388
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,160
 Are you where you say you are going to be?

389
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
 Do you follow through?

390
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,500
 Does drama follow you around?

391
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,200
 Okay.

392
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,320
 We wanna be people who smell as if we've been around Jesus.

393
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,280
 So here's just a good rule to live by if you're single,

394
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,560
 become the person that you wanna marry.

395
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,360
 Like whoever you wanna marry,

396
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
 whatever you want them to be like,

397
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,240
 if you want them to reek of Jesus,

398
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,880
 then become the person that you wanna marry.

399
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,640
 Because you know what?

400
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,880
 If you want to marry a godly woman,

401
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,720
 well, you know what?

402
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,880
 Godly women are attracted to godliness.

403
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,480
 So surrender your life to Jesus.

404
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,600
 Here's the second question

405
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,360
 that I believe will save your marriage before it begins.

406
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,760
 Do you have the right people in your life?

407
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,560
 Okay, do you have the right people in your life?

408
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,800
 So now we're skipping ahead in the book.

409
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,740
 We're gonna look at different sections

410
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,600
 of the entire book.

411
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,240
 So now we're skipping ahead a few verses to verse nine.

412
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,960
 We just saw the girl speak,

413
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,400
 now the guy is speaking and look at what he says.

414
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,240
 Verse nine, he says,

415
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,040
 "I compare you my love to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots."

416
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,120
 Baby, you're a horse.

417
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,080
 That's what he just said.

418
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,960
 Guys, don't use it.

419
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
 It's not gonna work.

420
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,120
 Verse 10, "Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,

421
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,680
 "your neck with strings of jewels."

422
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
 Now this is interesting because in verse 11,

423
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,400
 the girl's friends chime in.

424
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,280
 Anytime there's a guy and girl dating,

425
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,520
 there's always a group of the girl's friends nearby.

426
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,360
 And so they chime in and look at what they say.

427
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,240
 They say, "We will make for you ornaments

428
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,640
 "of gold studded with silver."

429
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,200
 So here's this group of friends

430
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,640
 that are looking at their girl friends saying,

431
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,560
 "Hey, we wanna make you more beautiful for this man."

432
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,640
 Okay, guys, I wanna let you in on something.

433
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,400
 I worked with college students at Texas A&M University

434
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,800
 for five and a half years.

435
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,380
 And here's what I learned for five and a half years, okay?

436
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,080
 Guys, here's what you need to know happens

437
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,040
 when you call a girl up and ask her out.

438
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,960
 I'm not talking about meeting her on a dating app.

439
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,220
 I know a lot of people meet these days through a dating app,

440
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,140
 but I'm talking, if you do the old fashioned way in college,

441
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,080
 and you call a girl up and ask her out,

442
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,420
 guys, I just want you to know,

443
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,680
 if you did that in your past, what happened, okay?

444
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,680
 When y'all hung up the phone, this is what that girl did.

445
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,560
 Okay, I'm telling you, this is just reality.

446
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,280
 I'm educating you now.

447
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,680
 She got off the phone and here's exactly what she did.

448
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,680
 She went, "Ladies, assemble!"

449
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,120
 (audience laughing)

450
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,060
 And it doesn't matter where she was

451
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,920
 on the planet at the time.

452
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,200
 It doesn't matter where her best girlfriends

453
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,040
 were on the planet.

454
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
 Somehow they magically appeared in 30 seconds.

455
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
 They were all right there.

456
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:35,280
 And she informed them that you asked her out.

457
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,060
 And then one of them took charge and asked the question.

458
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,520
 Not a question, the question.

459
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,280
 What was the question?

460
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,480
 What are you gonna wear?

461
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,760
 And then she gave the response.

462
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,600
 I don't really have anything.

463
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,760
 And that's all those girls needed to hear.

464
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,440
 They're like, we got you.

465
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,000
 So you need to know, guys, when she opened that door,

466
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
 she didn't own a thing that she was wearing.

467
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
 Am I wrong?

468
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
 She didn't own a thing of it.

469
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,200
 But that's a really amazing thing

470
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,160
 because what you see is you see these girls

471
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,040
 that were like, hey, we are committed to you.

472
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,620
 We want to make you as beautiful as possible

473
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,000
 for this guy who's gonna come and pick you up.

474
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,120
 You know what's even better?

475
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,920
 When there's a group of girls who have a vision

476
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,400
 for how to just bring out Jesus in their friend.

477
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
 And now I'm not just talking about girls.

478
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,300
 I'm talking about guys as well.

479
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,320
 Like the best thing for you

480
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,520
 is to have a group of girls if you're a girl,

481
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
 a group of guys if you're a guy

482
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,260
 who are committed to making you more like Jesus.

483
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,960
 That they are committed to seeing the character of Jesus

484
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,120
 come out in your life.

485
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,540
 And so the question that I'm asking is,

486
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,440
 is do you have the right people in your life?

487
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,840
 Because here's the reality.

488
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,640
 Like if you have a roommate right now,

489
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,280
 and even if you don't have a roommate,

490
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,120
 whoever your closest friends are,

491
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,880
 if they are single and they end up getting married one day,

492
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,240
 they will be someone else's lifelong roommate.

493
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,760
 So you can actually play a part

494
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,760
 in helping them become the best lifelong roommate possible.

495
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,800
 Like do you have some people in your life

496
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 who are not afraid to wound you by telling you the truth?

497
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,840
 The author of Proverbs says that,

498
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,720
 "The wounds of a friend can be trusted,

499
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,800
 "but an enemy multiplies kisses."

500
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,760
 Do you know what he's saying?

501
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,920
 He's saying, look, those who really love you

502
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,720
 aren't afraid to wound you by saying the truth.

503
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,320
 But you know what your enemy does?

504
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,020
 Your enemy just tells you what you want to hear.

505
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
 So do you have someone in your life

506
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,080
 that is close enough to you that could say,

507
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,120
 hey, you know what?

508
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
 There are times where I feel like

509
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,120
 I have to walk on eggshells around you.

510
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,000
 You know what they're saying?

511
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,760
 They're saying, you're kind of moody.

512
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,560
 That's good for you to know.

513
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,880
 Hey, when you're frustrated with me, you shut me out.

514
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,800
 Like you stop talking to me.

515
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,440
 You don't respond to me for days.

516
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,000
 And then when we get back together and hang out,

517
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,660
 you act as if nothing happened.

518
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,940
 That kind of feels like something that should be addressed.

519
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:32,120
 I don't think you ever have said the words, I'm sorry.

520
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,060
 And so I just want to encourage you

521
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,200
 that that probably isn't the healthiest thing.

522
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,040
 Or you know what?

523
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,280
 There's times where I hear you talk

524
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,040
 and I know the truth and you're exaggerating the truth.

525
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,180
 And I just want to encourage you

526
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,560
 to be a man or a woman of your word.

527
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,920
 Hey, how's your time with the Lord going?

528
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,860
 Are you experiencing consistency?

529
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,120
 If not, let's help one another out.

530
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
 Do you have those people in your life?

531
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,920
 Let me just give you a vision

532
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,120
 for what you want on your wedding day.

533
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,640
 When you stand on that altar,

534
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
 what you want to be able to do

535
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,440
 is you want to be able to look to your right or your left

536
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,240
 at either your groomsmen or your bridesmaids.

537
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,640
 And what you want to be able to do

538
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,160
 is you want to be able to look at each guy or each girl

539
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,180
 and know exactly why they're on that stage.

540
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,480
 Because God used them in your life

541
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,200
 to make you more like Jesus.

542
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,160
 So when I stood on that altar in Wichita Falls,

543
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,040
 I had 13 groomsmen.

544
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,720
 You're like, that's a brag, man.

545
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,200
 Like you clearly have a bunch of friends.

546
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,760
 No, it's because my wife has a bunch of friends

547
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,440
 and she had 13 bridesmaids.

548
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,640
 So I was like, I got my yard guy there.

549
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,760
 I got the RA in my dorm from years ago.

550
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,080
 I was like, man, come on.

551
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,060
 What's your name again?

552
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,260
 You'll work, you know?

553
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,040
 But when I stood on that stage and I looked down that line,

554
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,360
 I could look and say, you know what?

555
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,760
 God used these guys in my worst moments.

556
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,200
 When I was at rock bottom,

557
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,800
 at the height of my compromise in life,

558
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,960
 God used them to pick me up and restore me

559
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,640
 and help me get back on the path with Jesus.

560
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
 You know what?

561
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,080
 God used this guy to teach me the word of God.

562
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,560
 So I began to develop a love for the scriptures.

563
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,380
 You know what?

564
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,900
 This person helped me enter

565
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,160
 into healthy conflict resolution.

566
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,020
 That's what you want.

567
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,880
 Do you have the right people in your life?

568
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 Here's the third question

569
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,440
 that'll save your marriage before it begins.

570
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,540
 Do you know the difference between spring and winter?

571
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,400
 Do you know the difference between spring and winter?

572
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,680
 Skipping ahead now to chapter two, okay?

573
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,640
 Verse 10.

574
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,880
 So the context here is that the guy

575
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
 comes to visit his girl.

576
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,600
 He's come from out of town

577
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,180
 and he is inviting her out of the house

578
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,460
 to take a walk with him.

579
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,400
 Verse 10.

580
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,920
 The woman's speaking and she says,

581
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,240
 "My beloved speaks and says to me,

582
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 "arise my love, my beautiful one, and come away.

583
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,380
 "For behold, the winter is past.

584
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,740
 "The rain is over and gone.

585
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,200
 "The flowers appear on the earth.

586
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,060
 "The time of singing has come.

587
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,180
 "And the voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land.

588
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,700
 "The fig tree ripens its figs.

589
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,260
 "The vines are in blossom.

590
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,800
 "They give forth fragrance.

591
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,440
 "Arise my love, my beautiful one, and come away with me."

592
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,880
 Do you see what he's talking about?

593
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,080
 So he's inviting her to take a walk with him.

594
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,780
 And what does he start describing?

595
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,560
 He starts describing springtime.

596
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,640
 He talks about turtle doves.

597
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,480
 He talks about figs.

598
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,520
 And he's talking about things in blossom.

599
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
 He's talking about the time of year,

600
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,720
 the season where things are in bloom.

601
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,360
 That life is visible on the earth.

602
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,600
 And he's using springtime as a picture

603
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,760
 for their relationship.

604
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,320
 He's saying it's springtime outside

605
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,720
 and it's springtime in our relationship.

606
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,320
 You know that time of year,

607
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,720
 like right after winter in Texas,

608
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,680
 it's like that one day in March

609
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,760
 where it's sunny and 75 with a slight breeze.

610
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,480
 And it's like the day before it starts feeling

611
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
 like you're standing in front of a blowtorch.

612
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,320
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

613
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,240
 It's like that one day.

614
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,400
 And like you walk outside and the breeze hits you

615
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,120
 and you involuntarily like close your eyes

616
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,660
 and just stop for a moment.

617
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:29,560
 Because everything feels right for that moment.

618
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,640
 That's what he's talking about.

619
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,500
 He's saying it's springtime in our relationship.

620
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,640
 And so the question is,

621
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,040
 do you know the difference between winter and spring?

622
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,860
 What's winter?

623
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,200
 Winter is the time when everything goes dormant

624
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,280
 or everything dies and there's no signs of life.

625
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
 When Catherine and I started dating,

626
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,760
 we dated for eight and a half months

627
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,320
 and then we got married within 12 and a half months

628
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,840
 of our first date.

629
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,360
 And I would just say that our relationship,

630
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,840
 it felt like spring.

631
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,360
 It wasn't perfect.

632
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,920
 Like you need to know we had conflict.

633
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,800
 Okay?

634
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,760
 Conflict is a part of every relationship.

635
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,400
 If there's no conflict, that's the problem.

636
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,320
 Like if you have no issues, that's your issue.

637
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,120
 It's because you're ignoring the issues.

638
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,280
 The conflict is a part of every relationship.

639
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,920
 Conflict is actually an opportunity to glorify God.

640
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,540
 But our relationship, it felt like spring.

641
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,760
 It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't complicated.

642
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,220
 There was no on again, off again.

643
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,120
 There was no really difficult conversations

644
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,640
 of like what are we and is this really happening

645
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,040
 and where are we at with all of this?

646
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,120
 We knew what we wanted.

647
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,920
 Like we were both headed towards marriage.

648
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,000
 That's why we got into the relationship.

649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,760
 We both were following Jesus.

650
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,440
 We both wanted to follow Jesus individually

651
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,080
 and we wanted to follow him collectively.

652
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,320
 We were on the same page.

653
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,960
 We were headed in the same direction.

654
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,120
 It felt like spring.

655
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,820
 And yet I know what it's like to be in relationships

656
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,040
 that feel more like winter.

657
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,240
 Like I've been in relationships

658
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,160
 that really had looking back no signs of life.

659
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,200
 Like I've been in the relationships

660
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,440
 where it's on again, off again.

661
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,440
 And it's just so difficult

662
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,060
 because you never know where you're at.

663
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,720
 So it's like are we on or are we off?

664
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,460
 Like we're mad at each other.

665
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,520
 We're mad at each other.

666
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,000
 Now we're not mad at each other.

667
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,080
 Now we're mad in love with each other.

668
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,120
 Now we're not mad in love with each other.

669
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,900
 And there's hours and hours of conversation

670
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,320
 trying to figure out what we are and what we're not.

671
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,160
 Are we gonna do this?

672
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,120
 Are we not gonna do this?

673
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,020
 It's winter.

674
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,040
 I've been in relationships

675
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,480
 where things got really physical really fast

676
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,880
 so there was guilt and shame

677
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,160
 because that side of marriage,

678
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,920
 there were certain things that we didn't wanna do

679
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,080
 that we ended up doing.

680
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,200
 And so it felt like winter

681
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,720
 because guilt and shame was just constantly

682
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,860
 sucking out any of the joy of our relationship.

683
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,460
 And because we got so physical so fast,

684
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,140
 we never really got to know each other

685
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,340
 because we just spent all of our time doing physical stuff.

686
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,700
 And so it kept us in the relationship a lot longer

687
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,720
 than we should have ever been in it.

688
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,800
 Because in the end, that relationship,

689
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,380
 even though it was great person,

690
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,820
 just wasn't the right relationship.

691
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,660
 It was winter.

692
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,060
 I've been in relationship

693
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,900
 where there's a lot of insecurity.

694
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,980
 Like I still remember I was in this relationship

695
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,260
 where I was so nervous

696
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,760
 that this girl was gonna break up with me

697
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,340
 because she told me she didn't know

698
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,380
 if she wanted to keep dating

699
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,820
 because she didn't know if she liked how I looked.

700
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,340
 And I just remember like feeling so anxious about it.

701
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,040
 I look back now, I'm like, that was winter.

702
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,780
 That was winter.

703
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
 Like if you wanna know if you're in winter,

704
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,680
 it's when a girl's like,

705
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,060
 I don't know if I like how you look

706
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,260
 so I'll get back to you.

707
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,180
 Winter.

708
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:09,860
 Were those relationships fun?

709
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
 Sure.

710
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,820
 Did we make memories?

711
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,220
 Yes.

712
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,780
 Did it provide companionship?

713
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,820
 Absolutely.

714
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:23,340
 Yet, all the drama, all the insecurity,

715
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,580
 all the back and forth, all the tough conversations,

716
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,820
 all the guilt choked out the joy.

717
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,060
 It was winter.

718
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,900
 And you're like, so you're telling me

719
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,140
 that relationships always have to feel like spring?

720
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,580
 No.

721
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,420
 Every relationship has different seasons.

722
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,740
 And so just so you know,

723
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,460
 there are going to be some days

724
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,980
 that feel like winter in relationships.

725
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,300
 There are going to be some weeks in marriage

726
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,700
 that feel like winter.

727
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,260
 But it is not winter all year long

728
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,580
 anywhere in this world that you want to live.

729
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,940
 Period.

730
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,060
 It is not winter all year long

731
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,220
 anywhere that you want to be.

732
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,100
 And the same is true

733
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,420
 when it comes to romantic relationships.

734
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,020
 If the winter in your relationship,

735
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,420
 if the winter inside your relationship

736
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,900
 is lasting longer than the winter outside,

737
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,340
 there's probably very little signs of life.

738
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,020
 And so this is me just stepping in.

739
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
 You guys don't know me.

740
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,300
 I mean, I'm not around here much,

741
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,580
 but this is just me coming in saying, look,

742
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,100
 if it's winter in a relationship

743
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,780
 for an extended period of time,

744
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,380
 it's not just going to magically turn to spring

745
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,940
 if you get married.

746
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,300
 It will only get colder.

747
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,500
 I promise you.

748
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,860
 And so some of you guys just need to hear me say tonight,

749
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,300
 it might be time to have a tough conversation

750
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,780
 and go your separate ways.

751
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,620
 Why?

752
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,260
 Because in the end, it's not the right relationship.

753
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,020
 Now, the reality is,

754
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,460
 I know what it's like to be in a relationship

755
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,620
 that you're scared to get out of.

756
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,740
 And the reason that you're scared to get out of it

757
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,860
 is because you just can't envision your life

758
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,140
 without that person in it.

759
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,220
 But just because you can't envision your life

760
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,340
 without that person in it

761
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,300
 doesn't mean God can't envision your life

762
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,460
 without that person in it.

763
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,660
 He's trustworthy.

764
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,020
 He's a good king.

765
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,180
 Will you follow him?

766
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,900
 Next question that would hopefully save your marriage

767
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,020
 before it begins is this,

768
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,540
 what is shaping your expectations of sex?

769
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,460
 Skip over to chapter four just real quick.

770
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:41,260
 I just want to highlight this real quick.

771
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,220
 But look at the wording.

772
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,540
 It says, "Behold," it's the guy talking.

773
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,940
 "Behold, you're beautiful, my love.

774
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,060
 "Behold, you're beautiful.

775
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,420
 "Your eyes are doves behind your veil.

776
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,300
 "Your hair is like a flock of goats."

777
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,940
 Put that one away, guys.

778
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,700
 And never bring it out.

779
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,580
 "Your hair is like a flock of goats

780
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,220
 "leaping down the slopes of Gilead.

781
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,540
 "Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes

782
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,020
 "that have come up from their washing."

783
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,540
 That's my favorite verse.

784
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,260
 'Cause he's basically saying,

785
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,020
 "I love your teeth because you have all of them.

786
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,100
 "Your lips," verse three,

787
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,820
 "are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely."

788
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,620
 He's just working his way down the woman's body.

789
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,060
 This is on their wedding night.

790
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,940
 And I love it because he's moving slowly.

791
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,380
 Verse four, "Your neck is like the Tower of David

792
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,540
 "built in rows of stone."

793
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,140
 Who says that?

794
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,540
 "On it hang a thousand shields,

795
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,860
 "all of them shields of warriors."

796
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,380
 He's talking about her necklace.

797
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,020
 Verse five, "Your two breasts are like two fawns,

798
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,220
 "twins of a gazelle that gaze among the lilies."

799
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,060
 I wonder, I just picture this girl like,

800
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,740
 "Shut up already, like, please."

801
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,100
 But what I love is that he's moving slowly

802
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,620
 and he's communicating.

803
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,660
 Most guys, when it comes,

804
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,700
 when you're in the moment having sex,

805
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,540
 you can't even put a sentence together.

806
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,380
 And here's this guy, he is communicating clearly.

807
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,140
 I love that.

808
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,820
 And he's moving slowly.

809
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,300
 Verse nine, "You have captivated my heart,

810
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,020
 "my sister, my bride.

811
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,980
 "You've captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes,

812
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,460
 "with one jewel of your necklace.

813
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,060
 "How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride.

814
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,020
 "How much better is your love than wine

815
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,220
 "and the fragrance of your oils than any spice."

816
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,060
 Like he is, they are moving towards sex

817
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,900
 and you know what he does?

818
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,860
 He just stops to affirm her more,

819
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,460
 which is amazing because most likely,

820
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,140
 this is this girl's first time

821
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,660
 to be naked in front of a man

822
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,540
 or ever touched in a sexual way by a man.

823
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,540
 And so how is he operating slowly, safely, and selflessly?

824
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,740
 So a good question to ask is,

825
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,340
 what is shaping your expectations of sex?

826
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,260
 And I would imagine that for many of us, it's pornography.

827
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,220
 Like statistics would show that for many of us,

828
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,780
 even though we know sex isn't reality,

829
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,780
 we still treat, even though we know porn is not reality,

830
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,620
 porn still acts like sex ed for many of us.

831
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,380
 So the Barna Group does a study

832
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,220
 and they found that among young adults,

833
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,820
 57% of young adults seek porn out at least once a month.

834
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,140
 So in this room, 57% of you

835
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,180
 most likely seek porn out once a month.

836
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,180
 Remember watching an interview with Channing Tatum

837
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,460
 and the interviewer said, "Hey, do you ever look at porn?"

838
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
 He's like, "Yeah."

839
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,220
 They said, "Have you looked at porn in the last six months?"

840
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,740
 He's like, "Yeah."

841
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,260
 "Last six weeks?"

842
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,340
 "Yeah."

843
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,940
 "Last six days?"

844
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,380
 "Yeah."

845
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,340
 "Last six hours?"

846
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,500
 He's like, "What time is it?"

847
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,180
 And it's kind of like, it was meant to be funny,

848
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,460
 lighthearted, why?

849
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,620
 Because porn has just become normalized in our society.

850
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,580
 Pornography was a part of my story for seven years,

851
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,940
 was a part of my journey.

852
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,740
 And you know what it has done is it's hijacked,

853
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,740
 it hijacked my understanding of sex.

854
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,460
 And so I even carried that into marriage,

855
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,040
 not the struggle with pornography

856
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,100
 because God freed me from it,

857
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,540
 the act of it prior to marriage,

858
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,300
 but what I brought into marriage was a tendency

859
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,500
 to try and pornify my marriage.

860
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,740
 See, that's what you'll do,

861
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,220
 is because what pornography will do

862
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,460
 is it will hijack your expectations for sex.

863
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,980
 But what you have to understand is that pornography,

864
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,300
 if it's shaping your understanding,

865
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,380
 this is where I'm trying to save your marriage

866
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,580
 before it begins.

867
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,340
 Studies have observed a correlation

868
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,660
 between men's porn usage and greater sexual dissatisfaction

869
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,100
 with their significant other

870
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
 in the form of sexual boredom or disappointment.

871
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,420
 So if you bring porn into your marriage, men,

872
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,540
 there's a high likelihood that you will experience

873
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,220
 disappointment or boredom with your spouse

874
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,820
 because she is not who you watch in pornographic films.

875
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,100
 But the same can go for women, ladies.

876
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,200
 Like, pornography isn't just a guy problem,

877
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,500
 it's a people problem.

878
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,540
 And statistics would show that women struggle with porn

879
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,220
 just as much as guys do.

880
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,220
 Another study demonstrated that a man's porn use

881
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,340
 can cause a woman to be more self-conscious

882
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,420
 about her body and sexual performance,

883
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,140
 and thus lead to a decrease in attraction

884
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,380
 and desire for intimacy in the woman.

885
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,420
 So men, if you bring porn into your marriage,

886
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,500
 and I'll flip it, women,

887
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,900
 if you bring porn into your marriage,

888
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,020
 you know what it can do?

889
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,420
 It can cause insecurity in your spouse,

890
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,540
 and it can decrease their attraction to you

891
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,940
 or their desire to be with you.

892
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,940
 Another study found that over an extended period of time,

893
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,620
 if there's porn use in the marriage,

894
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,620
 that the probability of divorce doubles.

895
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,380
 And so I just tell you that to say,

896
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,820
 look, some of y'all are like, well, I've already blown it.

897
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,520
 Like, I've been looking at porn for years.

898
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,460
 Hey, remember the power of Jesus Christ,

899
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,500
 that he gives new starts to messy lives,

900
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,260
 and it is never too late to step into obedience.

901
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,020
 And God can do a great work in your life,

902
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,100
 and you can have a great marriage

903
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,340
 that is preceded by an extended season of purity.

904
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,820
 And that will be a blessing to your spouse.

905
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,420
 Next question quickly is this, do you know what love is?

906
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,220
 Do you know what love is?

907
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,380
 You look at Song of Solomon, chapter eight.

908
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,940
 If you skip over to chapter eight,

909
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,300
 this is the love passage in the Bible

910
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,620
 when it comes to romantic love

911
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,180
 between a man and a woman, verse six.

912
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,580
 The woman is talking, she says,

913
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,780
 "Set me as a seal upon your heart,

914
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,660
 "as a seal upon your arm," watch this,

915
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,940
 "for love is strong as death,

916
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,900
 "jealousy as fierce as the grave,

917
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,640
 "it's flashes or flashes of fire,

918
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,300
 "the very flame of the Lord.

919
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,140
 "Many waters cannot quench love,

920
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,700
 "neither can floods drown it out.

921
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,420
 "If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house,

922
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,460
 "he would be utterly despised."

923
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,580
 Do you see what she's saying?

924
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,260
 She says, "Love is as strong as death."

925
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,540
 In the ancient Near East,

926
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,340
 people would compare their feelings to death

927
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,980
 to convey the intensity of them.

928
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,460
 We still do that today.

929
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,340
 We will still text, "I'm dead."

930
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,860
 Like we still use it to convey our feelings.

931
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,740
 We're just being biblical when we say that.

932
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,220
 But if you think about death,

933
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,620
 death is irreversible, right?

934
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,820
 Like no one dies and changes their mind.

935
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,020
 It's irreversible.

936
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,700
 She says, "Love is as strong as death."

937
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,000
 So when you stand on the altar one day and you say,

938
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,780
 "I promise to love you until death do you part,"

939
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,740
 you know what you're saying?

940
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,080
 You're saying, "Look, I know what love is.

941
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,160
 "Love is a choice.

942
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,100
 "Sometimes it's a feeling, but it is always a choice.

943
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,760
 "I don't need to know what's going to happen

944
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,620
 "between now and the day we die,

945
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,440
 "but I do know that I am committed to loving you

946
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,460
 "every single day because love is irreversible."

947
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,660
 And she says, "It's as jealous as the grave."

948
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,700
 Jealousy there, it's not talking about insecurity.

949
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,500
 It is talking about intense passion.

950
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,200
 It's the idea that love is passionately exclusive.

951
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,060
 It's as jealous as the grave.

952
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,140
 If you think about the grave,

953
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,840
 the grave doesn't share with anyone.

954
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,740
 Like no one gets put in the ground and then shared around.

955
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,720
 It's passionately exclusive.

956
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,440
 The love that I have with Kat

957
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,940
 is not to be shared with anyone else in the world.

958
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,600
 That's why websites like AshleyMadison.com,

959
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,560
 it's an app that exists for married people

960
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,760
 to have an affair.

961
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,160
 The tagline for Ashley Madison is,

962
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,540
 "Life is short, have an affair."

963
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,800
 It is the opposite of love.

964
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,200
 The final question that I want to ask you is this,

965
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,840
 to hopefully save your marriage before it begins.

966
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,900
 Have you both experienced a greater love?

967
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,000
 Have you both experienced a greater love?

968
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,340
 See, the love between a man and a woman

969
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,520
 in the Song of Solomon,

970
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,520
 it's ultimately to point to a love that is greater,

971
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,760
 the love of Jesus Christ that he has for his people,

972
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
 the church, the bride of Christ.

973
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,380
 Do you know the love of God,

974
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,380
 that God, a perfect father, gave his son for you?

975
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,540
 In love, he gave his son for you,

976
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,580
 Jesus Christ, who wasn't his God.

977
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,620
 He left heaven on a pursuit,

978
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,300
 like a man should pursue a woman.

979
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:45,300
 He left heaven pursuing you in me, coming to earth.

980
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,560
 And he loved you enough that he would give his life for you.

981
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,620
 So when Jesus Christ hung on the cross,

982
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,300
 he was thinking about you, in love.

983
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,740
 Have you ever thought that there is someone in this world

984
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,820
 that loved you so much that they actually died for you?

985
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,540
 And when he died on that cross,

986
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,420
 he took all of your sins upon himself.

987
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,220
 On the third day, he rose from the dead,

988
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,460
 conquering your sins, why?

989
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,340
 So that you could be completely forgiven by God.

990
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,300
 It doesn't matter where you've been, what you've done.

991
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,620
 Do you believe that because God loves you so much,

992
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,940
 he can forgive anything you've done,

993
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,020
 no matter where you've been and what you've done?

994
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,620
 And Jesus Christ has come so that through faith in him,

995
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,680
 when you surrender your life to him,

996
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,900
 you know what happens?

997
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,900
 Is you enter into a real, enjoyable,

998
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,020
 intimate relationship that will last for all of eternity.

999
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,340
 Jesus wants you for all of eternity.

1000
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,020
 Do you know that greater love?

1001
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,020
 I wanna close tonight just by

1002
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,140
 illustrating what I'm talking about tonight.

1003
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,380
 So if I can just invite some friends on stage, real quick.

1004
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,460
 (audience murmuring)

1005
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:07,500
 This is my friend Andrea, and I'm just gonna ask her

1006
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,780
 if she will just run in place.

1007
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,880
 So if you'll just start running in place for a minute,

1008
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,280
 or maybe for a few, but yeah, you wanna stretch it out,

1009
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,060
 get loose, it's great, good.

1010
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
 So here's what I want you to think about, okay?

1011
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,300
 Andrea's running to symbolize running towards Jesus.

1012
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,900
 And so she's fixing her attention forward,

1013
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,500
 she knows Jesus, she loves Jesus,

1014
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,380
 and she is running towards Jesus.

1015
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,580
 This is where you wanna be,

1016
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,460
 this is what you wanna be doing, okay?

1017
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,140
 You wanna smell like Jesus,

1018
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,860
 you wanna live fully surrendered to him,

1019
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,220
 you wanna fix your gaze on him and run towards him

1020
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,100
 with all of your heart.

1021
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,180
 And for some of you, this is just what you need

1022
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,940
 to focus on right now.

1023
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,380
 You need to not worry about finding the one,

1024
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,580
 you need to just focus on being with Jesus

1025
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,780
 and enjoying Jesus.

1026
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,380
 But if you're in a good place to date,

1027
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,660
 like Andrea, here's the reality,

1028
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,460
 like you've got options.

1029
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,420
 And so, hey, let me just say this,

1030
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,340
 for the guys in the room, like we can flip this as well.

1031
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,500
 So this isn't just an illustration

1032
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,120
 for the girls regarding guys, like you can flip it.

1033
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,580
 Guys, you can imagine yourself surrounded by girls.

1034
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,940
 Some of you are like, Lord, please make that so.

1035
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,940
 (congregation laughing)

1036
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,220
 But Andrea, like you've got options,

1037
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,780
 like you've got this option back here.

1038
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,220
 Andrea, why don't you go ahead and check it out?

1039
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,740
 Now, don't take your eyes off Jesus,

1040
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:39,740
 but Andrea, don't look back, but what do you think?

1041
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,420
 Like, hello, Andrea, I told you, stop,

1042
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,700
 don't look at me, don't look at him.

1043
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,860
 Here's the reality, like you have options,

1044
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,500
 but there are good options,

1045
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,660
 and then there are options that aren't the best.

1046
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,380
 So you've got some people

1047
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,920
 who are walking through life right now,

1048
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,320
 and they're just walking at a pace that you're not.

1049
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,100
 It's not possible to run towards Jesus

1050
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,060
 and keep your eyes on Jesus and look back at the same time.

1051
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,220
 And so there's going to be some options in your life

1052
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,820
 where they don't smell like Jesus.

1053
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,980
 You get around them and you don't smell Jesus

1054
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,620
 because they're not living surrendered to Jesus.

1055
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,380
 Or you know what, their understanding of sex

1056
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,920
 isn't being shaped by the word of God,

1057
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,580
 it's being shaped by culture.

1058
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,180
 Or maybe they just don't have the right people

1059
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,540
 in their life who are sharpening them and encouraging them.

1060
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,600
 And so I'm just telling you

1061
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,780
 that this guy isn't the best option.

1062
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,020
 And then you got these options.

1063
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,380
 So guys, you need to be running

1064
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,700
 because if you're not running,

1065
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,500
 she's going to leave you in the dust.

1066
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,660
 But you got these different options.

1067
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,180
 Now, I think about this option right here.

1068
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,020
 And here's the thing,

1069
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,620
 like he's running at the same speed you are.

1070
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,720
 Here's the difference.

1071
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,220
 He's running in slightly a different direction than you are.

1072
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,380
 And so this is where things can get problematic

1073
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,380
 because you know what, you can look and be like,

1074
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,300
 yeah, but you know what, we have so much fun together

1075
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,620
 and he's a family guy and he's got a lot of integrity

1076
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,780
 at his work and we're both highly ambitious.

1077
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,700
 And so we could be a power couple together

1078
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,820
 because we're both crushing it on our work.

1079
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,260
 We're both making a lot of money.

1080
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,660
 You put that together and the double income,

1081
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:31,900
 no kids season of life will be glorious.

1082
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,580
 And we like the same foods, we like the same music.

1083
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,900
 We got tickets to T-Swift today.

1084
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,460
 And so we're going to do that and that's going to be awesome.

1085
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,380
 Here's the problem is that he is,

1086
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,260
 right now it looks like he's just heading

1087
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,900
 in slightly different direction,

1088
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,260
 but you play this out over decades

1089
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,060
 and those are two totally different trajectories.

1090
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,740
 Andrea, my fear is that this is a scenario

1091
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:02,420
 with a guy who has never experienced that greater love.

1092
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,180
 What is most important to you, Jesus,

1093
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,020
 isn't important to him.

1094
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,020
 And if you're not careful,

1095
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,080
 you'll spend your marriage praying for your spouse

1096
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,860
 instead of praying with your spouse.

1097
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,940
 And so then Andrea, you've got guys that

1098
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,180
 you look to your right or your left,

1099
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,900
 hey, you don't need to find the one,

1100
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,120
 you can just find one.

1101
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,620
 And so let's just say you're out,

1102
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,380
 like you can just find one.

1103
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:33,020
 And here's the thing, like this is what you want.

1104
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,240
 Like you want to just run towards Jesus

1105
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,940
 and if you look to your right or your left

1106
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,220
 and you see someone else running towards Jesus,

1107
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,860
 you find someone that you get around him

1108
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,540
 and he smells like Jesus,

1109
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,100
 you spend time with him and it's clear

1110
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,420
 that he has friends who are encouraging him,

1111
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,500
 he has the right people in his life,

1112
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,260
 it's clear that he has an understanding

1113
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,340
 of what a spring-like relationship looks like,

1114
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,300
 he has a vision for what love is,

1115
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,540
 he's experienced that greater love,

1116
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,180
 then that can be a really good thing.

1117
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,700
 But it isn't an ultimate thing.

1118
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,980
 So here's the thing, Andrea,

1119
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,340
 whether that's your reality,

1120
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,760
 and that could be your reality,

1121
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,020
 like this winter, maybe God brings you into a relationship

1122
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,300
 and if he does, praise God, that's a good thing.

1123
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,620
 But whether that's your reality or this is your reality,

1124
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,480
 the best thing you can do is run wholeheartedly

1125
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,860
 towards Jesus 'cause we don't run to find a spouse,

1126
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,940
 we run to enjoy Jesus.

1127
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,780
 Would you guys give Andrea a hand?

1128
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,280
 (congregation applauding)

1129
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:48,980
 I just wanna ask you to close your eyes.

1130
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:54,900
 And I just wanna ask you to do business

1131
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,900
 with the Lord right now.

1132
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,860
 I don't know what he's doing in your heart,

1133
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,340
 I don't know what he's saying to you,

1134
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,300
 I don't know what he's pressing on you with,

1135
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,140
 but I do wanna say if you're here tonight

1136
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,800
 and you're understanding what a greater love looks like

1137
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,440
 for the first time, for the first time

1138
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,280
 you're understanding the love that Jesus Christ has for you,

1139
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,660
 and you wanna begin a relationship with him,

1140
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,640
 then I just encourage you right in this moment

1141
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,100
 to invite him in through faith.

1142
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,100
 Just say, Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?

1143
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,920
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

1144
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,240
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died on the cross for me.

1145
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,700
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

1146
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,740
 Would you come into my life?

1147
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,500
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

1148
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,380
 And would you begin to lead me in a new life?

1149
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,720
 No matter where you're at,

1150
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,140
 maybe God's calling you to get out of a relationship.

1151
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,540
 Maybe God's just revealing an area of your life

1152
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,220
 that doesn't smell like him.

1153
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,160
 My hope is that you'd just find his grace in this moment,

1154
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,760
 that you would sense that he's speaking to you

1155
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,940
 because he loves you.

1156
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,280
 He's not mad at you, but he loves you deeply.

1157
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,220
 And so would you just sit in that love tonight,

1158
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,620
 and would you meet with him?

1159
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,200
 (gentle music)
