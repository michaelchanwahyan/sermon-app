1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,080
 - Well hello, Porch friends, how we doing?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,380
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,080
 I love being here on Tuesdays.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,760
 Thank you for having me tonight.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,680
 We have prayed much already, so I shall dive right in.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,120
 We're wrapping up a series that we've been doing here,

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,080
 if you haven't been around, and I know I've met some folks

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,760
 who are here for the first time, we're glad you're here.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,400
 But we've been walking through a series called Adulting.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,080
 What we're looking at here is just a mature view on life.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,600
 The Bible says, "When I was a child, I thought as a child."

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,960
 But I gotta let those things go away

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,440
 'cause I'm not a child anymore.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,160
 There is a phrase that has been laid on your generation,

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,160
 which I believe is not necessary or correct

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,800
 if you don't want it to be.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
 And that is that you are the generation

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,980
 of perpetual adolescence.

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,400
 In other words, you just don't wanna grow up.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,040
 Hashtag adulting, man.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,680
 Every now and then, you'll do things that look like

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,600
 what a grownup would do,

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,440
 but you're just not ready to get it done.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,180
 So we date like children,

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,080
 we think of relationships like children,

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
 we forego family and responsibility like children,

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,620
 we play with faith like children,

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,160
 and not in the way that Jesus commands.

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,000
 We deal with our money like children.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,520
 We talk about things of corporate

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,680
 and communal relationships like children,

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,920
 and I'm telling ya, it won't go well with you

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
 if you do that.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,000
 And so we're not talking about what it means

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
 to be a generation of men and women,

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,160
 and not just any men or any women,

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,720
 but godly, spiritually appraised, informed men or women,

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,520
 so that it might go well with you.

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,240
 Let me just start by saying this,

41
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,840
 because every chance I get,

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,560
 if I could speak only on one topic,

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,440
 it would be on the nature and character of God.

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,280
 Why?

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,480
 Because my job is to be a servant of Christ

46
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
 and a steward of the mysteries of righteousness.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,520
 I've got nothing to offer you except what I've been given,

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,800
 and I want to proclaim to you the excellencies of God.

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,920
 And that starts with understanding who God is

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,400
 and what he's done for you,

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,380
 but the reason I want to talk about who God is

52
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,200
 and what he's done for you is because the very first lie

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 out of the chute attacked the very nature of God.

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,240
 And the problem that all of us have

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,920
 and the reason that we act like children,

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,740
 or if you will, impetuous, feeling-driven,

57
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,240
 emotionally-based people,

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,400
 is because we don't believe that there is a God

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,640
 who is good, that we are culpable to,

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,920
 that is sovereign, and that is wise, and that he loves us.

61
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,620
 And so we suppress truth and unrighteousness

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,020
 because we think that running away from this authority

63
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,260
 figure is what's going to give us authentic life.

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,440
 That lie doesn't just affect millennials.

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,780
 It affects folks 20 years ahead of you like me,

66
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,720
 and it affects folks 10 years behind you.

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,560
 It affects everybody.

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,120
 It's the first lie right out of the chute.

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,320
 God isn't good, his word's not true,

70
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,520
 disobeying him is not that big a deal.

71
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,720
 The very first lies that came.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,260
 Now you need to know this about God

73
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,860
 because one of the things that a wise and mature person

74
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,940
 will do is he won't jump to conclusions

75
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,940
 based on just some preliminary examination of the facts.

76
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,760
 He knows that not every good book has a great cover.

77
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,200
 And so he wants to see what the depths

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 of the content are there.

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,960
 Now when you want to find out who somebody is,

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,620
 you listen to their words because the words

81
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,880
 are the overflow of a man's heart.

82
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,940
 And then you want to look not just at their words,

83
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,180
 but how their works back up their words.

84
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,560
 So let me just take you to the words and works of God.

85
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,320
 What God has done in this book called the Bible,

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,060
 the book, that's an arrogantly titled book,

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,700
 the Biblias, the book, it is the one book you need to know.

88
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,540
 Why?

89
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,500
 Because it's the one book that tells you

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,940
 where you came from, why you're here,

91
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,180
 why while you're here the world is in the condition

92
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,580
 that it's in, what to do about that condition,

93
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,580
 why you can live with hope in the midst of this condition,

94
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,260
 and what the remedy to your condition is.

95
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,540
 The Bible is not a rule book, it is a love letter from God.

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,100
 It is his effort to explain to you things

97
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,820
 that eye hasn't seen, ear hasn't heard,

98
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,580
 things that haven't entered into the mind of man.

99
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,020
 The Bible is trying to let God share with you

100
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,020
 what is going on in his story.

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,260
 And what's happened is we're living in his story

102
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,620
 in a moment in time that is not as he desired,

103
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,180
 but because he is not a divine rapist,

104
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,280
 he does not impose on us that which we do not choose.

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,340
 God is a God of relationship,

106
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,020
 and because he's a God of relationship,

107
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,620
 he has given us the ability to make decisions.

108
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,540
 And because we have the ability to make decisions,

109
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,460
 some of our decisions can go in a way

110
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
 that though they seem right to us in the beginning,

111
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,400
 they end up as the way of death, just like children.

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,080
 Children sometimes think, if I eat this way,

113
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,760
 it'll be good for me, 'cause it always tastes good up here.

114
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,480
 But we know if you always eat what tastes good,

115
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,520
 it doesn't always go well with you from the neck down.

116
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,880
 It won't look good, and it won't feel good

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,680
 if you just put in your mouth whatever tastes good.

118
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,960
 Children run into danger, they don't know the difference

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,680
 between a rope and a snake, a curb and a cliff.

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,040
 And they need somebody to guide them.

121
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,500
 So I wanna tell you, what God has done in this book

122
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,620
 is he's told you that we are in the condition

123
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,740
 that we're in because we have rejected this idea

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,800
 that God is good, and that we can find life and light

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,360
 and hope and love and satisfaction in him,

126
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,120
 even though everything in the human experience early on

127
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,760
 testified that that was the case.

128
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,520
 We believed the lie, God wasn't good.

129
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,520
 The reason, the liar said, that he doesn't want us

130
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,560
 to eat of the tree of good and evil

131
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,960
 is not because we should show faith in him

132
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
 and have a relationship with him

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
 rooted in our own election.

134
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,640
 And the reason that, that's why God put it there,

135
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,360
 and the reason that God doesn't want us to eat of that tree

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,480
 is not because he thinks if we eat it

137
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
 we can be as smart as him and not need him,

138
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,640
 it's because he knows that nobody

139
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,280
 is intrinsically good except him.

140
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,200
 Our goodness comes from him.

141
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,240
 And knowing good and evil, we won't always choose

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,480
 that which is good.

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,120
 Can I get an amen from this crowd on this?

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
 Most of the mistakes that we make, even in our 20s,

145
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,000
 is not a mistake that we make from a lack of information.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,840
 We know that probably ain't right.

147
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,560
 Okay, being addicted to two-dimensional images of women

148
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,920
 and finding my sexual satisfaction there

149
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,760
 and finding my affirmation from women there

150
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,480
 in a fantasy world is probably not the best route to go.

151
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,040
 It'd be much better if I could really share my heart

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,640
 and soul with another and enjoy in reality

153
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,680
 what is only a fantasy for me.

154
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,360
 I am not all pro if I'm all maddened on Xbox.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,520
 And so I'm not gonna sit there and wear a Hall of Fame

156
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
 jacket 'cause I kick tail in some Xbox league

157
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,640
 and wonder why the world doesn't take note.

158
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,880
 I know that to be a man really in that small world

159
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
 of football, I gotta get out there

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,440
 and compete where it matters.

161
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,840
 And yet some of us give more time to being great

162
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,800
 with our thumbs than we do be actually great in our living.

163
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,480
 There's so many illustrations that most of the mistakes

164
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,720
 we make are not mistakes made because of a lack of knowledge.

165
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
 See, God says, look, here's your deal, Wagner.

166
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,600
 You can know everything that I know,

167
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
 but you're not gonna do what I do

168
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,920
 'cause you're not intentionally good.

169
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,320
 What you need is a relationship with me.

170
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,700
 And the reason I don't want you to eat of this tree

171
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,360
 that will make you think you don't need me

172
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,640
 is because you do need me.

173
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,040
 And the day you don't think you need me,

174
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,640
 you'll start doing things that seem right to you

175
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
 but will end up with death.

176
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
 So the story goes that we bought the lie

177
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
 that we don't need God.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,060
 We bought the lie that he wasn't good,

179
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,900
 that his word wasn't true.

180
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,240
 And we bought the lie that disobeying him

181
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,200
 was not that big a deal.

182
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,480
 And that got us to 2016 and where we are.

183
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,140
 But here's what you need to know about God.

184
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,640
 In Deuteronomy chapter four, God is starting to tell you

185
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,000
 a little bit about who he is and what he is like.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,600
 And he's going to do that by developing

187
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,920
 a relationship with people.

188
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,680
 And he's going to choose a certain group of people

189
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,000
 to work with, not because he loves those people

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,880
 more than other people, but because he's gonna show

191
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,360
 the world that through these people

192
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,840
 who he will give eyes to see, ears to hear,

193
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,760
 and hearts to respond, by the way that they begin

194
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
 to walk with God again, and by the way that they are blessed

195
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,340
 other nations would go, hey, what's going on with you?

196
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,840
 And they were to respond, not we're better than you,

197
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,120
 smarter than you, brighter than you,

198
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,300
 we got a better military than you.

199
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,800
 They were to respond, we have come to know

200
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,280
 that God is good and we have walked with him.

201
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,840
 So this is what God said to this group of people

202
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
 that he chose to reveal himself to.

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
 This is Deuteronomy chapter four, verse 32.

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,580
 He says, indeed, ask now concerning the former days

205
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,000
 which were before you, since the day that God created

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,280
 man on the earth, and inquire from one of the heavens

207
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,780
 to the other.

208
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,840
 In other words, go look back through all of human history.

209
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,680
 Has anything been done like this great thing,

210
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,280
 which is you who were lost and in darkness

211
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,200
 have been called out of darkness into this great light.

212
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,680
 Has anybody ever heard of anything like this?

213
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,380
 This isn't just some myth, this is anchored in history.

214
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,800
 Verse 33, has anybody heard the voice of God

215
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,380
 speaking from the midst of a fire

216
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,960
 as you have heard it and survived?

217
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,560
 No, God, the very God of creation,

218
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,200
 the power of the internal earth has come to you

219
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,280
 and told you something, or has a God tried to take

220
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,600
 for himself a nation from another nation

221
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,160
 by trials, by signs, and by wonders,

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
 and by war and a mighty hand and an outstretched arm?

223
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,120
 Now watch this, and by great tears

224
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,600
 as the Lord has done for you, know that the Lord,

225
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,080
 he is God, there is no other beside him,

226
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,800
 it says in verse 35.

227
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
 This is the God you've come to know.

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,800
 This is the words of Moses as he's getting ready

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,080
 to advocate his leadership, pass it on

230
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,240
 to the next generation of leaders,

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,680
 and he's telling them, just observe who you are,

232
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,120
 where you've come from, why you've been given

233
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,680
 what you've been given, out of the heavens,

234
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,960
 he lets you hear his voice to discipline you,

235
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,880
 and on earth he let you see his great fire,

236
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
 the scripture says, and you heard his words

237
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
 in the midst of the fire, why?

238
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,600
 Why does God give us his words?

239
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,660
 The scripture tells us in verse 37,

240
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,920
 because he loves your fathers.

241
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,680
 Therefore he chose to love the children of those fathers,

242
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,840
 and he personally brought you out of slavery

243
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,280
 and bondage and oppression from wicked rulers,

244
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,400
 which is represented by Egypt to the Israeli people,

245
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,040
 by his great power.

246
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,720
 You didn't do anything except follow God to life,

247
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,280
 just like in the New Testament.

248
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,640
 And when you got into this land you're about to go in,

249
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
 he's gonna drive out nations that are greater

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
 and mightier than you to bring you

251
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
 and to give you in their land for an inheritance

252
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,120
 as it is today, know therefore today,

253
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,240
 watch this, we're getting to the point,

254
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,080
 know therefore today and take it into your heart

255
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,160
 that the Lord, he is God in heaven, above,

256
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,520
 and on the earth below, there is no other.

257
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,740
 Know that he is God, know that he is good,

258
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,400
 know that his word is true, know that he's trying

259
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
 to save you from oppression, the oppression of self,

260
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,520
 or some sick other human who is trying

261
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,440
 to establish himself by oppressing you.

262
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,400
 And he says this to you, so you shall keep his statutes

263
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,480
 and his commandments which I am giving you today.

264
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,880
 That's not new information, right,

265
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,960
 that God wants you to listen to him,

266
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,600
 but I want you to listen to why.

267
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,720
 That it might go well with you

268
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,040
 and with your children after you,

269
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,560
 and that you may live long in the land

270
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,100
 which the Lord your God is giving you for all time.

271
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,240
 Did you see what the heart of God is?

272
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,260
 The heart of God is that you would grow up

273
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,080
 and not think like an impetuous child

274
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,640
 who always thinks he knows more than other people

275
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,520
 and who will throw fits and tantrums and cry

276
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,800
 and use intimidations and every manipulation

277
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,000
 known to humankind to get what they want

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,520
 because they are absolutely certain

279
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,980
 that their dad must hate them

280
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,320
 because he doesn't pour Mountain Dew on his Lucky Charms

281
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,780
 breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

282
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,680
 And yet that dad goes, listen, I'd love nothing more

283
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,440
 than to give you a bowl of ice cream every now and then.

284
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,640
 I love the marshmallow, you know,

285
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,060
 in that little bad sugar-coated wheat inside Lucky Charms,

286
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,600
 but we can't live like that.

287
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,740
 It's not because I'm mean.

288
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,520
 It's 'cause I love you.

289
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,800
 And see, what happens as you grow,

290
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
 you start to understand

291
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,560
 that your mom wasn't just a jerk

292
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,280
 and your dad wasn't oppressive.

293
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,760
 They really wanted it to go well with you,

294
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
 and so you start then to act like them

295
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,120
 and feed yourself like them

296
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,400
 and hopefully walk like they wanted you to walk

297
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,720
 if you had parents who pushed you in that direction.

298
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
 This is the story of who God is.

299
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
 He is our Father.

300
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,460
 Some of you guys did have parents

301
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,260
 who loved you well and led you well.

302
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,500
 And God, the Scripture says,

303
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,460
 has a special place in his heart for you.

304
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,580
 And he doesn't want you to continue

305
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,460
 the legacy of dysfunction.

306
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,300
 He wants it to go well with you,

307
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,180
 that it might go well with your children after you,

308
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,340
 and that you might live long in the land,

309
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,480
 not be defined by despair.

310
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,300
 Now, here's the thing.

311
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,820
 The way things go with leaders

312
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,660
 is typically the way things go with the land.

313
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,340
 The reason I love to talk to the porch

314
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,660
 is because this is true.

315
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,880
 The philosophy of schoolchildren in one generation

316
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,460
 will be the philosophy of government in the next.

317
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,920
 Let me say that again.

318
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,300
 The philosophy of schoolchildren in one generation

319
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,900
 will be the philosophy of government in the next.

320
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
 And so what you're seeing in America today

321
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,300
 is leadership that has not been discipled

322
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
 and that acts like children

323
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,380
 and that doesn't know that there is a God

324
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,160
 who they should trust in,

325
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,100
 that if they trust in him,

326
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,440
 it will go well with them and for their children,

327
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,980
 and they will live long in the land.

328
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,020
 What you're seeing is that we are about

329
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,420
 to put ourself in a position

330
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,160
 where our land is no longer secure.

331
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,220
 If there's anybody that's suffering in America today,

332
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,620
 it is children, and it is not going well with us in general.

333
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,620
 We keep pretending we don't have $19 trillion in debt.

334
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,260
 We keep pretending that annihilating 60 million Americans

335
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:59,260
 because they seem inconvenient to us is not a problem.

336
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,540
 And the fact that we don't keep adding workers

337
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,980
 to our workforce that would go to work

338
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,260
 and contribute to the social welfare system

339
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,420
 and the fact that they're absent

340
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,660
 isn't part of the reason that we have a problem

341
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,280
 supporting this generation of folks who aren't working now.

342
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,580
 We just suppress the truth that unrighteousness

343
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,860
 is not going well with us,

344
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,680
 and there's going to be a day very soon

345
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,580
 when we are not secure in the land,

346
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,420
 and I'm gonna tell you,

347
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,340
 already we see our children suffering immensely.

348
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,680
 Depression is at an all-time high with children.

349
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,280
 Suicide rates at an all-time high with children.

350
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,560
 Drug use, medicating ourselves, all-time high.

351
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,620
 Emptiness, lostness, despair,

352
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,660
 fracture in the home, all-time high.

353
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 Because we don't have leaders who are adults,

354
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,400
 who understand truth and consequences.

355
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,580
 And God loves you.

356
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,540
 Here's what I want to tell you something.

357
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,640
 You guys look at this and you go,

358
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,920
 "What is this world that our parents have given us?"

359
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,740
 And you probably look specifically

360
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,860
 at leadership and government and you go,

361
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,740
 "I don't have any interest in government.

362
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,040
 "I have no interest in politics

363
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,780
 "because politics is not the source of my hope."

364
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,100
 And let me just encourage you,

365
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,660
 you are absolutely right when you say

366
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,640
 politics are not the source of your hope,

367
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,840
 but I'm gonna tell you something.

368
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,200
 Politics are something that you're responsible for.

369
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,980
 And the source of your hope

370
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,960
 wants you to have an effective politic.

371
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,060
 And what I'm gonna talk to you tonight about

372
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,780
 is having an adult view of government, policy, and politics.

373
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,540
 Because let me tell you,

374
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,820
 right now in this generation,

375
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,700
 apathy towards politics is at an all-time high.

376
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,860
 And on one hand, I wouldn't blame you

377
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,140
 because you go and say

378
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
 there's nothing but corruption that is there.

379
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,260
 Let me just read you a few quotes

380
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,680
 that have been around when you start to think about

381
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,620
 politics in general.

382
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,260
 And I love these because you're not the first people

383
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
 that have been discouraged

384
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,700
 when you start to think about politics and how they go.

385
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,420
 John Adams.

386
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,540
 That's like, "We're just getting started, John Adams."

387
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,420
 Said this, "That in my many years,

388
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,100
 "I have come to a conclusion

389
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,180
 "that one, useless man is a shame.

390
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,100
 "Two is a law firm.

391
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,740
 "Three is Congress."

392
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,580
 All right?

393
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,940
 And that's like right out of the chute.

394
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,580
 Mark Twain said this, "Suppose you were an idiot.

395
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,660
 "And suppose you were a member of Congress."

396
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,860
 "But I repeat myself."

397
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
 That's what he said.

398
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,200
 G. Gordon Liddy, who worked in the Nixon administration,

399
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,040
 said this.

400
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,600
 He said, "A liberal, or somebody who doesn't live by laws

401
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
 "that are right, is someone who feels a great debt

402
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,900
 "to his fellow man, which debt he proposes to pay off

403
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,740
 "with your money."

404
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,700
 He didn't trust folks in government.

405
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,180
 P.J. O'Rourke, a guy that was another leader and thinker,

406
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,940
 said, "If you think healthcare is expensive now,

407
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,440
 "wait until you see what it costs when it's free."

408
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,860
 And one guy said this 400 years before Christ.

409
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,660
 "Just because you don't take an interest in politics

410
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,540
 "doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you."

411
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,700
 In other words, let me just tell you something, guys.

412
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,800
 Politics comes from the root word which means citizen.

413
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,300
 When you talk about politics,

414
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,340
 you're talking about citizenry.

415
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,460
 One of the same words that has the same root word

416
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,800
 as citizenry is the word for polite.

417
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,580
 In other words, politics is us talking about governance.

418
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,040
 How are we going to live?

419
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,860
 What is right, what is wrong,

420
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,260
 what is going to make it go well with us,

421
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,220
 and what is going to lead to despair?

422
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,700
 And so if you, Christian, if you,

423
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,580
 a person who's supposed to seek the welfare

424
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,260
 of the city in which you live, why?

425
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,380
 Because you're like your father

426
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,860
 who seeks the welfare of people

427
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,000
 and seeks to rescue them from darkness

428
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,420
 and deliver them to light.

429
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,100
 You, who are here as aliens and strangers,

430
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,940
 'cause you don't live like the rest of the children

431
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,780
 who don't know that there is a set standard

432
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,140
 of righteousness and good given you by a loving father

433
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,380
 who wants it to go well with you,

434
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,020
 you seek the welfare of others

435
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,820
 by being heralds of righteousness

436
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,940
 and declaring to others the way, the truth,

437
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,580
 and where life can be found.

438
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,140
 You should be concerned with the way

439
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,900
 that men govern their lives,

440
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,260
 because the way that men govern their lives

441
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,340
 will lead to the way that men live.

442
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:25,460
 And so you can't afford to be apathetic,

443
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,340
 apathetic from the word pathos, which means emotion.

444
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,020
 We get empathy.

445
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,740
 I feel your pain.

446
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,740
 If you are apathetic, it means you don't really care.

447
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,820
 One kid was asked by his teacher one day,

448
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,180
 "Hey man, what's apathy mean?"

449
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,620
 Johnny, and Johnny, "I don't know, I don't care."

450
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,540
 Okay, so that was the only question he got right, right?

451
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,040
 That's what apathy means.

452
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:56,140
 We can't afford to be apathetic about conduct.

453
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,280
 The same root word for politics

454
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,780
 is the same word for polite.

455
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,000
 The word polite is the word for what is right.

456
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,820
 The word right is the same root word for righteousness.

457
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
 If we're not concerned for righteousness,

458
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,620
 what are we concerned with?

459
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,500
 And the reason that God is concerned for righteousness

460
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,360
 is because he's concerned with you.

461
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,900
 And so I'm just gonna tell you something, gang.

462
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,740
 You don't have the option to sit back there

463
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,740
 and just say, "I don't care about polity,

464
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,940
 "governance, politics."

465
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,460
 The idea of being a citizen, that's an office in our country

466
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,020
 we have a country that is a government of the people,

467
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,780
 by the people, for the people, and God is for people.

468
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,780
 And so he wants you to govern in a way

469
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,260
 that leads to blessing.

470
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,780
 What you are doing when you vote

471
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,100
 is you are delegating your right to rule to somebody else.

472
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,900
 And so you better not be apathetic about that.

473
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:12,120
 You better care deeply about who your rulers are,

474
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,760
 and you better want to know who rules your ruler.

475
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,820
 If you're not actively, gang,

476
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,740
 taking on the swift destruction that's in our land,

477
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,960
 if you're not paddling against wrong,

478
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,840
 then you are being swept away

479
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,000
 by the current of unrighteousness.

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,620
 And it is the job of adults to say enough is enough.

481
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,180
 And I'm gonna tell you something,

482
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,080
 your generation had better grow up.

483
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,500
 Because we need you, because a lot of people

484
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,160
 in my generation have failed you.

485
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,500
 And so I'll tell you what you can do.

486
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,700
 You can say, "My daddy was a drunk,

487
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,660
 "my daddy left my mama, so I'm gonna be a drunk

488
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,260
 "and I'm gonna leave my mama."

489
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,960
 And guess what, your kids will be just as angry as you.

490
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,960
 You can say, "My mom medicated herself into numbness,

491
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,420
 "my mom slept with six, seven, eight different guys

492
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,320
 "while I lived in the home with her,

493
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 "and so I'm just gonna find my significance

494
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,900
 "and prostitute myself out to men in my 20s

495
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,660
 "and probably all the way through my life, just like mama."

496
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
 And you can be just as miserable as mom.

497
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,620
 Or you can say, "I'm gonna break the chain.

498
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,920
 "And I'm gonna maybe be the first person in generations

499
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,220
 "to start to not live like a child."

500
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,900
 And so I'm just gonna tell you, we, my generation,

501
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,020
 some of us have tried,

502
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,500
 but there has not been enough of us to make a difference.

503
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,940
 And we are giving you a problem.

504
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
 What children do when there's problems

505
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,060
 is they grab their blankie,

506
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,580
 they stick their thumb in their mouth,

507
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,660
 they go in the corner and they curl up and they go,

508
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,940
 (kissing)

509
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,260
 and I'm gonna tell you, we can't afford

510
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,220
 to have another generation of children.

511
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,220
 We need you to be men.

512
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,820
 We need you to be on the alert,

513
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,500
 to stand firm in the faith, to act like men,

514
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,000
 to be strong, to let everything you do be done in love.

515
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,100
 It is time for a generation to rise up

516
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,000
 and to understand truth.

517
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,440
 It is a fact that your generation is, right now,

518
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,860
 the major reason that a socialist

519
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,860
 is getting a lot of attention for leadership in his party.

520
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,740
 Socialism sounds like a great idea to children.

521
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,220
 I'm not gonna do anything,

522
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,980
 I'm gonna sleep in on Saturdays,

523
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,340
 I'm gonna play Xbox,

524
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,500
 and I expect there to be good food on my table

525
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,340
 in the evening.

526
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,940
 I'm gonna work out, I'm gonna be infatuated by body,

527
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,740
 I'm gonna play with myself and play with others' bodies,

528
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,940
 and I'm gonna expect to get to do that again the next day.

529
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,620
 If it's hard, I don't wanna do it very long.

530
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,560
 I want what I want, that's what children say.

531
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,620
 Somebody else can do the work.

532
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,500
 Feed me, clothe me, dress me, take care of me,

533
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,840
 and it will not go well with you.

534
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,540
 Now look, before I talk more about socialism in general,

535
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,900
 let me just tell you that I'm not wild

536
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,300
 about any of the solutions that are being put before you

537
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,740
 that are out there.

538
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,940
 I don't know if you guys have seen this little meme

539
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,980
 that's been out there right now.

540
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,940
 There's Sanders, there's Trump,

541
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,780
 there's Hillary, there's Cruz.

542
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,780
 (audience laughing)

543
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,220
 I ain't gonna go with Pinestraw.

544
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,340
 You ever feel like that?

545
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,660
 You're like, what the, you know, why?

546
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,460
 That's why you're apathetic.

547
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,220
 Hey, let me just say something to you real quick,

548
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,420
 because people ask me this time,

549
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,340
 what do I do right now?

550
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,460
 How do I vote?

551
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
 How do I determine how I participate

552
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,180
 as a person charged by God and given the freedom

553
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,140
 to have an office in a democratic republic,

554
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,360
 which means that we have the right

555
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,260
 to delegate authority for governance to other people.

556
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,780
 What do I do if I don't see anybody fit there?

557
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,140
 Well, I'll tell you what you don't do.

558
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,820
 Sometimes you can vote for the lesser of two evils,

559
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,660
 and this is important.

560
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,020
 I want you to listen to me.

561
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,660
 Until Jesus Christ himself runs for office,

562
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,460
 you will always be voting for the lesser of two evils.

563
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,980
 The Bible says all men are liars.

564
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,240
 Jesus says that when you look at a woman

565
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,300
 with lust in your heart, you commit adultery,

566
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,180
 but watch, listen to me.

567
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,780
 While it's true that compared to the righteousness of God,

568
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,380
 all men are liars, that doesn't mean you hire somebody

569
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,960
 who habitually practices deceit.

570
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,060
 Just because it's a fact that if you look at somebody

571
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,820
 with lust in your heart, you're an adulterer,

572
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,380
 it doesn't mean, gals, that you just marry a guy

573
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,780
 and you ignore his philandering ways.

574
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:04,740
 There are individuals who the direction of their life

575
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,540
 is not towards deceit, although compared

576
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,580
 to the holiness of God, all men are liars.

577
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,060
 There is none who does right.

578
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,700
 It's always the lesser of two evils,

579
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,060
 but is there a man whose practice

580
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,060
 and who the direction of their life, not the perfection,

581
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,820
 but the direction of their life is towards rightness?

582
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
 Are they humble?

583
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,860
 Are they ruled by a wisdom that is more

584
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,440
 than just the polls of the day?

585
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,420
 Do they know that there is a God who intends it

586
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,720
 to go well with them, who defines morality, not culture?

587
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,660
 And there are times when you will look

588
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,220
 at different candidates and you'll say,

589
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,900
 I think I can support this candidate,

590
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,460
 but I'm gonna tell you, there are certain things

591
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,580
 that you look at in candidates and you go,

592
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,120
 I can't call that a lesser of evils.

593
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,700
 That is flat evil.

594
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,380
 When you have somebody who says as part

595
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,700
 of their effort to be in office,

596
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,920
 I think it's okay to kill people,

597
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,540
 you cannot delegate your authority to that person.

598
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:09,740
 When you say, I think it's okay to treat people differently

599
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,800
 because of the color of their skin,

600
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,980
 or their gender, or their nationality,

601
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,440
 to oppress them, to treat them as worms,

602
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,300
 or cockroaches, or as less than human,

603
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,000
 you cannot vote for that person.

604
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Because you can't delegate your authority to them,

605
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,720
 so you'll tell, what do I do if it's them or Pinestrong?

606
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,960
 Okay, one of the things that really bothers me

607
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
 is I hear people say this, well, I'm not gonna vote

608
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,680
 for that person because they're not electable,

609
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,380
 not enough people will vote for them,

610
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,340
 and so if I vote for them, I'm throwing my vote away.

611
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,020
 You are never throwing your vote away

612
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,500
 when you stand for righteousness, ever, okay?

613
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,540
 And what happens is too many people have bought the lie

614
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,180
 that you can't elect somebody like that,

615
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,980
 and all of a sudden, we quit pursuing something like that.

616
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,020
 Do you guys know that maybe what we think

617
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,580
 is the greatest president who ever lived, Abraham Lincoln,

618
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,580
 when he ran, there were two primary parties

619
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,980
 in our system of government.

620
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,820
 They were the Whigs and the Democrats,

621
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,420
 and he ran as a third-party candidate,

622
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,660
 something called a Republican, and he got elected.

623
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,740
 Sometimes, a third-party candidate won't get elected,

624
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,680
 but what he'll do is he'll start to awaken the country

625
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,620
 to something better, and people sometimes don't think

626
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,220
 that there is something better out there

627
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,740
 because everybody either settled or was apathetic,

628
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,680
 didn't care, and didn't participate.

629
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,700
 You don't have that freedom.

630
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,260
 Adults don't put their thumb in their mouth

631
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,220
 and sit in the corner and sulk.

632
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,820
 They seek justice, they do good, they speak up,

633
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,620
 they stand firm, they stay humble, and they serve their king.

634
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,820
 So sometimes, gang, you might have different views

635
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,740
 on certain financial policies,

636
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,900
 you might have different views

637
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,540
 on even certain immigration policies

638
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,380
 about who we should let in

639
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,620
 and how we should deal with folks who are here illegally,

640
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
 and you might say that's a lesser of two evils,

641
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,380
 but there are certain things where you're gonna say,

642
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,080
 "I cannot vote for a lesser of two evils

643
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,620
 "because I can't delegate my authority to evil."

644
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,580
 And if that is the case, you write in, you speak up,

645
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,020
 you tell people why you can't,

646
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,500
 and you rally support behind somebody

647
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,300
 whose direction is towards righteousness,

648
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,160
 and maybe eventually, we'll have something better.

649
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,780
 But you cannot not vote because our country's leaders

650
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,340
 are not chosen by people who have the right to vote.

651
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,240
 Our country's leaders are chosen by people who vote.

652
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,320
 And actually get in there and do it.

653
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,900
 And adults don't back down.

654
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,900
 They go to work, and they stand firm.

655
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,960
 So let me just say to you, as individual citizens

656
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
 who are concerned, therefore, with,

657
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,960
 as the Latin word for citizen is the same word as politic,

658
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,040
 it's a politike, and that person is concerned

659
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
 with governance, he governs himself well,

660
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,360
 and he decides to have others govern the land well.

661
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,760
 Let me tell you that one of the problems we have

662
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,080
 is that only a virtuous people

663
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,980
 are capable of enduring freedom.

664
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,180
 As nations become more and more corrupt,

665
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,520
 as they become slaves to more and more masters,

666
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,320
 they will be victims of more and more tyranny.

667
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,660
 In fact, when the Constitutional Convention in 1787 gathered

668
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,940
 and there was a lot of secrecy about what was happening

669
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,720
 and putting together the Constitution,

670
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,140
 a lady caught Benjamin Franklin as he was walking out

671
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,760
 of the Constitutional Convention, and she said,

672
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,700
 "Mr. Franklin, what kind of republic have you given us?

673
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,180
 "What kind of government have you given us?

674
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,040
 "Is it a republic or is it a monarchy?"

675
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,280
 And with no hesitation, Franklin looked at her,

676
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,380
 and he said, "It is a republic, ma'am,

677
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,820
 "if you care to keep it."

678
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,720
 Now, how do you keep it?

679
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
 You keep it in the way that our early leaders said

680
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,840
 that we should keep it.

681
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,280
 Listen to some of this stuff right here,

682
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,600
 and then I'm gonna tell you guys what we can do

683
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,060
 in light of where we are.

684
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,140
 This is George Washington

685
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,560
 at our very first presidential inauguration speech.

686
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,280
 He says, "The foundation of our national policy

687
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,720
 "will be laid in the pure and immutable principles

688
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,480
 "of private morality.

689
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,500
 "The propitious smiles of heaven

690
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,520
 "can never be expected on a nation

691
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,580
 "that disregards the eternal rules of order and right

692
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,840
 "which heaven itself has ordained."

693
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,240
 John Adams said, "Our constitution was made

694
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,080
 "only for a moral and religious people.

695
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,600
 "It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."

696
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,680
 One guy said this about government in general

697
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
 when he took a look at everything that was going on,

698
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,320
 and that is this, that the best argument against democracy

699
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,520
 is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.

700
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,200
 "Democracy," one guy said,

701
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
 "gives every man the right to be his own oppressor."

702
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,060
 In other words, once people figure out

703
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,240
 that they can vote for themselves their own entitlements,

704
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,960
 it's the beginning of the end.

705
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,360
 This is why you have got to speak up to your generation

706
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,720
 who has somebody running for national leadership

707
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,320
 in the same way that you ran for class president

708
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,200
 in the fourth grade.

709
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,280
 How'd you do that?

710
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,960
 - If you make me class president,

711
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,280
 we'll have ice cream every day for lunch

712
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,120
 and pizza every day,

713
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,560
 and we'll have summer recess, we'll go for six months,

714
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,120
 and lollipops and cotton candy

715
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,440
 and finally they just pull you off the stage, right?

716
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,780
 (audience laughing)

717
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,620
 But people are like,

718
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,980
 "Wow, he's gonna give us ice cream every day for lunch.

719
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,580
 "Let's vote for Todd."

720
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,680
 (audience laughing)

721
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,260
 Well, Todd didn't exactly approve that with the school board

722
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,620
 and those that fund ice cream every day for lunch.

723
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,940
 And so I just wanted to say this to you guys

724
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,580
 because that's a child's view.

725
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,020
 Let somebody else work for me.

726
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,460
 I'm gonna be lazy and selfish.

727
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,620
 So I wanna just acknowledge this.

728
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,180
 The inherent vice of capitalism,

729
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,440
 by the way, Churchill said this.

730
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,180
 The inherent vice of capitalism

731
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,140
 is an unequal share of the blessings.

732
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,620
 Some people work hard and get more,

733
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,620
 or some people work and get lucky.

734
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,580
 And so within a capitalistic society,

735
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,760
 there is an unequal sharing of the blessings,

736
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,420
 but the inherent blessing of socialism

737
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,900
 is the equal sharing of misery.

738
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:29,420
 Margaret Thatcher said the problem with socialism

739
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,060
 is that eventually you run out of other people's money.

740
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,980
 I love this quote by a guy named Herbert Spencer.

741
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,500
 He said, "The ultimate result of shielding men

742
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,820
 "from the effects of folly

743
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,820
 "is that they'll fill the world with fools."

744
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,540
 You can't legislate the poor into prosperity

745
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,900
 by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.

746
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,140
 It just doesn't happen.

747
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,660
 What one person receives without working for,

748
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,700
 or another person must work for without receiving,

749
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,380
 that's a problem.

750
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,820
 And what happens is when half the people get the idea

751
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,660
 they don't have to work

752
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,340
 because somebody else is gonna work for them

753
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,760
 and they will take care of them,

754
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,920
 then when the other half gets the idea

755
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,160
 that it's no good to work

756
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,460
 because they don't get taken care of

757
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,820
 with their own effort and work,

758
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,880
 then nobody works and then you've got real problem.

759
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,300
 That's the problem with socialism.

760
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,140
 I love this meme that's been put out there right now

761
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,340
 that just says, "Hey, look, man, here we go."

762
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,100
 Right?

763
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,400
 So, hey, I took half of your sign

764
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,540
 because you had one and I didn't.

765
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,860
 I'm sure you understand.

766
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,220
 See, that's the problem with socialism right there, okay?

767
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,120
 That's not the way it works, children.

768
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,620
 You go to work, you take care of yourself,

769
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,220
 you take care of those who cannot take care of themselves.

770
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:53,140
 You're generous and because you are not just a capitalist,

771
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,280
 but you're a capitalist whose life is informed by Christ,

772
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,420
 you, like him, though you are rich,

773
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,360
 become poor for the sake of others,

774
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,500
 just like Jesus did for us.

775
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,060
 All right?

776
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,880
 So, gang, listen.

777
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,660
 [audience applauding]

778
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,240
 Your generation is feeding off

779
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,120
 this fourth grade elementary school candidacy.

780
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 Your generation is apathetic towards what is polite,

781
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,920
 political, right, righteous.

782
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,760
 We can't do that.

783
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,540
 There's 83 million of you.

784
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,000
 You have the ability to go,

785
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,380
 "Hey, look, I came from a dysfunctional family

786
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,260
 "who for the last 16 years and the 10 years before that

787
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,080
 "and the 10 years before that has lived irresponsibly.

788
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,480
 "I'm not gonna continue the cycle of madness

789
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,020
 "that my parents have given me.

790
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,180
 "I'm gonna say we're gonna break the chain.

791
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,800
 "And I'm not gonna be apathetic about how we're governed.

792
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,980
 "I'm gonna get engaged.

793
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,640
 "I'm gonna cast my vote for righteousness

794
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,600
 "and I'm not gonna delegate my right to rule

795
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,780
 "to people that aren't ruled rightly."

796
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,200
 That's what adults do.

797
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:14,160
 So here's what I would just encourage you guys with.

798
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,660
 I would encourage you guys in the midst of this situation

799
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,120
 that we're in is to know this,

800
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,180
 that anarchy and rebellion is easy.

801
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:29,680
 But administration, okay, which is righteous rule, it's not.

802
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,600
 And children always do what's easy.

803
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,000
 Adults do what's hard.

804
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
 If they're good adults, right,

805
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,680
 that's what you wanted your dad to do,

806
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
 to do the hard thing 'cause it was right for the family.

807
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,000
 And some of you guys don't like dad

808
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,220
 because he advocated his role.

809
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,560
 And this is your time.

810
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,040
 And so if you see poor leadership before you learn from it

811
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,160
 and don't repeat their sins,

812
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
 somebody has to say enough and make it your generation.

813
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,240
 Let's change this thing.

814
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,880
 And say, "I'm not gonna vote."

815
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,160
 Certain people, they're not just the lesser of two evils.

816
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,660
 That is evil and I will not support that.

817
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,320
 That is irresponsible.

818
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,680
 That's that oppression of the poor,

819
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,220
 that discriminatory racial language, that fascism,

820
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,620
 that murder of the innocent.

821
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,280
 I cannot delegate my authority to you.

822
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,440
 I will find another.

823
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,600
 But I will not just do nothing.

824
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,440
 Anybody can rage against the man, folks.

825
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,520
 That's what kids do.

826
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,320
 They throw tantrums against the man.

827
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,580
 Adults step up and go, "I'll be the man.

828
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,860
 "I'll do right.

829
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,620
 "I'll take this thing on and I'll change this bad boy around

830
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,480
 "and I'll be a part of the solution."

831
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,240
 And so what I'm gonna do tonight with you guys

832
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,840
 is just encourage you to get busy and be the solution.

833
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,020
 What I wanna tell you to do is to make sure

834
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,440
 that you're not somebody that thinks

835
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,040
 that the solution is government,

836
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,640
 but you're also not somebody that thinks

837
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,000
 there is no opportunity to do something

838
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,700
 in the way that we are governed.

839
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,040
 That we wanna be people who step up and say,

840
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,800
 "Hey, I'm gonna try and make a difference

841
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,520
 "in this world, in this life."

842
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,440
 Let me just encourage you,

843
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,640
 this is the purpose of government.

844
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,980
 It's in 1 Peter chapter two, verses 13 and following.

845
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,840
 It says, "Submit yourself for the Lord's sake

846
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,860
 "to every human institution,

847
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,600
 "whether to a king as to one in authority

848
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,880
 "or to governors as sent by him

849
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,680
 "for the punishment of evildoers

850
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,360
 "and the praise of those who do right."

851
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,080
 That's the purpose of government,

852
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,680
 to punish evildoers and to praise those who do right.

853
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,260
 And so you wanna make sure that you put in office

854
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,900
 people who know what evil is

855
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,380
 and call evil, evil and good, good.

856
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:52,620
 And woe to a land when they call evil, good and good, evil.

857
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,480
 "For such is the will of God,

858
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,980
 "that by doing right,

859
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,600
 "you might silence the ignorance of foolish men.

860
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,080
 "So act as free men," the scripture says.

861
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,080
 "Do not use your freedom as a covering for evil,

862
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,920
 "but use it as bond slaves of God.

863
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,680
 "Honor all people, love the brotherhood,

864
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,840
 "fear God, honor the king."

865
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,880
 We wanna be individuals that understand

866
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,980
 that the way we choose a king is we ask our king,

867
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,580
 again, ask our ruler, who rules my ruler?

868
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,180
 And I wanna just share with you

869
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,900
 this little section of scripture

870
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,020
 also in Deuteronomy in chapter 17.

871
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,780
 This is what God said to Israel

872
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,240
 about something that needs to be true of the king.

873
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,080
 The king's gotta know that God is good, his word is true,

874
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,360
 that disobeying him is gonna cost people eventually.

875
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,480
 One of the problems we have is that right now,

876
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,620
 people go, "Well, it's still working.

877
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,000
 "We're still being disobedient, we're still being lazy.

878
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,440
 "It's not hurt us yet, so I guess we can keep doing it."

879
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,720
 And we're just ignoring the law of the harvest.

880
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,440
 That's you reap what you sow.

881
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,700
 You reap it later than you sow it,

882
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,720
 and you reap more than you sow.

883
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,880
 What do I mean by that?

884
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,520
 If you sow an apple seed,

885
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,280
 you're not just going to get an apple,

886
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,880
 and you don't just get an apple the next day.

887
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,520
 It takes time for that apple seed to germinate, die,

888
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,360
 and go in the ground,

889
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,080
 but when an apple seed germinates and grows,

890
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,240
 what do you get, an apple?

891
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,480
 What do you get?

892
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,200
 You get an apple tree.

893
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,720
 You reap what you sow, you reap it later than you sow it,

894
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,200
 and you reap more than you sow.

895
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,580
 Adults know that.

896
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,080
 And they don't keep reaping destruction

897
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,220
 and think it's gonna turn to prosperity.

898
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,920
 You don't just entertain your flesh

899
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,580
 and do whatever the heart wants

900
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,780
 and expect there not to be a devastation in your life

901
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,440
 and the life of those that are around you.

902
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,280
 You know that, you've experienced that.

903
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,080
 And so this is what God said to the nation of Israel.

904
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,640
 When you go to enter into the land,

905
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,600
 which the Lord, dear God, gives you in verse 14,

906
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,880
 and you possess it and you live it,

907
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,200
 and you say, "I will set a king over me

908
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,800
 "like all the nations who are around me,"

909
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,040
 he would say, "That's a problem,"

910
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,280
 but he says, "You're probably gonna do that one day."

911
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,560
 And he says, "When you do that,

912
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,280
 "I want you to make sure that he does this."

913
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,320
 Jump down to verse 18.

914
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,160
 He says, "It shall come about

915
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,480
 "when this king sits on the throne of his kingdom,

916
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,640
 "he shall write for himself a copy of this law

917
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,840
 "on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priest."

918
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,680
 So watch this.

919
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,960
 This is the only person in the entire nation,

920
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,520
 okay, gang, that was supposed to have

921
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
 his own copy of the law.

922
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,840
 And when he becomes a ruler,

923
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,920
 he was supposed to sit down and to hand write out

924
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,800
 the constitution for how people should be governed.

925
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,320
 And he wasn't just to do it on his own.

926
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,560
 People were to look over his shoulder,

927
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,200
 hey, hey, Chumlee, you just missed

928
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,600
 an entire paragraph there.

929
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
 Well, I'm not really wild about it.

930
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,320
 It's not yours to decide what part

931
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,360
 of good governance you adopt.

932
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,240
 This is the constitution that will lead to blessing.

933
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,120
 We believe in rex, not rex lex, but lex rex.

934
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,960
 What's that mean?

935
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,360
 It's an old Latin phrase for the king is not the law.

936
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,600
 That's rex lex.

937
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,960
 We are lex rex.

938
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,080
 The law is king.

939
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,800
 There are certain things that we can't tamper with.

940
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
 And if you tamper with them,

941
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,760
 it's not gonna go well with us.

942
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,240
 So let's make sure you get it right.

943
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,520
 And by the way, this is where the idea came

944
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,600
 that our president says,

945
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,360
 "I'm gonna live by this constitution,"

946
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,000
 which understood sin, nature of man,

947
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,440
 which is why it divided powers,

948
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,680
 because they knew that power corrupts

949
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,400
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

950
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,000
 They knew that this nation had come about

951
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,280
 because of divine providence.

952
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,640
 They knew that all men were given by their creator

953
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,720
 certain inalienable rights.

954
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,640
 And they knew that if they did not govern themselves,

955
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
 it wasn't gonna be long before the government

956
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,960
 of the people, by the people who didn't govern themselves,

957
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,440
 would have a government for the people,

958
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,080
 which was leading to destruction.

959
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,640
 David and I were talking about this beforehand

960
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,680
 and I've mentioned before,

961
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,520
 and he reminded me of the fact

962
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,320
 that the communist government of China

963
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,280
 looked at America and the fact that America kept winning.

964
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,640
 Have you heard one of our candidates say,

965
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,720
 "China's killing us because our leaders are idiots.

966
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,520
 "They're killing us, they're killing us."

967
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,920
 Well, here's the truth.

968
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,400
 For a long time, China looked at America,

969
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,440
 "They're killing us."

970
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,240
 And China sent sociologists over here to study America.

971
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,240
 And when they came over here,

972
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,320
 they thought that the reason that we were successful

973
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,640
 is because of maybe our history, our political systems,

974
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,400
 our economic systems, our cultural perspective.

975
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,880
 They thought maybe it was 'cause we had powerful guns

976
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,840
 or some system of politics or economics.

977
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,320
 But it says they studied over 20 years

978
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,200
 and they went back home and they reported

979
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,160
 to the communist leadership of China

980
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,800
 that the reason that the culture of America

981
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,640
 is more prosperous than the culture of China

982
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,440
 is because of the moral fabric of the nation

983
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,120
 being built on this thing called a Judeo-Christian ethic.

984
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,640
 That is the communist observation.

985
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,080
 They go, "Interestingly enough,

986
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,720
 "this church that we've tried to oppress in China,

987
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,600
 "when it's come in here and it's gone into certain villages

988
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,160
 "and the Christian moral foundation in China

989
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,880
 "has swept through a village

990
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,880
 "where the culture of faith emerges inside Chinese villages,

991
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,560
 "we can see that there is a reduction in opium addiction,

992
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,400
 "there's a reduction in crime,

993
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,200
 "and Christian communities and families

994
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,800
 "grow wealthier in China than their neighbors."

995
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,280
 It's almost like Deuteronomy 4 is true.

996
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,080
 And what the Chinese government said is,

997
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,540
 "Look, gang, it's what Alex de Tocqueville found

998
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,700
 "when he came over here from France.

999
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,740
 "He said the secret of America is her greatness,

1000
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,480
 "and when she ceases to be good, she will cease to be great."

1001
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,600
 And folks, what you've got going on right now

1002
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,400
 is we have a nation of children who want what they want,

1003
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,040
 and we no longer work for the common good,

1004
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,260
 and we no longer pursue what divine providence

1005
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,060
 has embedded into law, and we're acting like children.

1006
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,420
 And I feel this way, so it must be okay.

1007
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,820
 You have to let me do these things.

1008
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,080
 I don't care if it redefines the historic family,

1009
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,280
 which has always been the root foundation of strength

1010
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,760
 for any civilization.

1011
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,120
 I don't care that life and future generations

1012
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,400
 are the source of our strength and posterity.

1013
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,500
 If we don't want it, we'll kill it.

1014
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,000
 And when they come, we'll ignore them

1015
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 and keep choosing our own little fantasies,

1016
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,360
 and we'll never grow up.

1017
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
 Some of you guys have grown up in those homes,

1018
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,920
 and it's time for some adults to show up,

1019
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,640
 and this generation can do it.

1020
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,900
 And we need you.

1021
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,360
 And some of you guys need to be reparented

1022
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,040
 and reeducated by the Father in heaven who loves you

1023
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,860
 and cares for you.

1024
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,120
 Now look, here's what I'm gonna tell you.

1025
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,560
 I don't believe that hope rides on Air Force One.

1026
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,800
 I believe the hope of our nation rides

1027
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,780
 in the hearts of individuals,

1028
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,460
 and it rides in a righteous generation.

1029
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,880
 The way to affect an election,

1030
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,340
 ultimately the way to affect a country,

1031
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,240
 I would tell you is simply this,

1032
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,120
 is to share with others how they can become

1033
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,760
 and walk among the elect.

1034
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,960
 The elect are those, literally,

1035
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,080
 that means to be called out of darkness

1036
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,120
 into His marvelous light.

1037
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,840
 The way to change your country is to change its citizenry,

1038
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,400
 and the way to change citizenry is to proclaim Christ.

1039
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,780
 And so why you should vote, every chance you get,

1040
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,840
 you vote with your life, and you vote with your prayers,

1041
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,260
 and you vote with your mouth,

1042
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,000
 and you declare the goodness of God.

1043
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,600
 Let me just encourage you, gang.

1044
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,380
 You should desire righteous laws,

1045
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,900
 because righteous laws lead to prosperous lands,

1046
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,580
 and because you care about people,

1047
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:59,220
 you want there to be a governance that is good.

1048
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,020
 And you go, well, Ty, I don't know if I wanna,

1049
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,320
 you know, legislate morality.

1050
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,940
 I don't know if we should legislate morality.

1051
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,020
 That's what law is, it's a moral code.

1052
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,860
 There is no such thing as a law

1053
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,220
 that is not the legislation of somebody's morality.

1054
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,060
 The question is not should we legislate morality,

1055
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,020
 the question is whose morality are we going to legislate?

1056
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,620
 Man's, it seems right, but ends in death,

1057
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,860
 or God's, 'cause he wants it to go well with you,

1058
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,560
 your children, and your posterity.

1059
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,460
 Just so you know, this thing called the Establishment Clause

1060
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,020
 which was written into our Constitution,

1061
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,660
 which says that government should make no law

1062
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,020
 respecting the establishment of the religion

1063
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,260
 or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,

1064
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,760
 was written not to keep the church out of government,

1065
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,700
 but to keep the government out of the church.

1066
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,820
 That idea of separation of church and state,

1067
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,140
 it's not in your Constitution.

1068
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,460
 It was written by President Jefferson at the time

1069
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,900
 to a group of Baptists in Connecticut

1070
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,780
 who were concerned that the Congregationalist church

1071
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,820
 which dominated in Connecticut

1072
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,260
 and was trying to influence government

1073
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,600
 by having their particular expression of following Christ

1074
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,300
 to be the rule and the law of the land,

1075
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
 the Dansbury Baptists said to the President,

1076
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,900
 "We're concerned that we may not get

1077
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,780
 "to participate in government

1078
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,420
 "because we're not Congregationalists."

1079
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,500
 And he said, "We will make sure

1080
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,160
 "that there is a wall of separation

1081
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,940
 "between church and state."

1082
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,140
 And what that means is we're not gonna let the state

1083
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,540
 tell you how to worship God.

1084
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,640
 But it was never ever intended to say

1085
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,700
 that we don't want the church

1086
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,460
 to inform how we govern ourself.

1087
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,080
 That's where righteousness comes from.

1088
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,340
 So I'm not here, gang, listen, this is my job

1089
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,180
 and this is your job

1090
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,940
 and this is what I'm gonna ask of you tonight.

1091
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:44,180
 We're not here to impose our will on anybody,

1092
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,460
 but we are here to make a divine proposal.

1093
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,900
 And that is, gang, there's a better way.

1094
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,400
 And we tell our friends, look, I know you think

1095
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,100
 that right now you're in your 20s

1096
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,620
 and you can just kinda party on

1097
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,780
 and you'll get serious about life later,

1098
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,100
 but that's not gonna go well with you.

1099
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,760
 I know you feel this way.

1100
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,680
 I know the world's telling you

1101
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,180
 it's okay to chase your feelings,

1102
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,460
 but I'm telling you, feelings are real,

1103
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,900
 they're not reliable.

1104
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,340
 And what you wanna do is be somebody

1105
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,020
 just like Jesus makes a proposal,

1106
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,820
 there's a better way, come with me.

1107
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,420
 Somebody who used to live in darkness,

1108
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,580
 but now has been called out and I'm living in light,

1109
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,420
 come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden,

1110
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,380
 I will give you rest.

1111
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,940
 They may not listen.

1112
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,480
 It's not our job to change them,

1113
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,780
 but it is our job to make sure

1114
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,020
 that we don't participate in their anarchy

1115
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,880
 and rebellion against a government

1116
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,520
 that they don't get to vote for.

1117
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,520
 Loving people won't do it.

1118
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,020
 They will speak up, stand firm, stay humble,

1119
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,880
 and serve the king.

1120
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:49,420
 So I wanna just encourage you with this, man.

1121
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,900
 This is not new information that we're gonna live in a land

1122
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,060
 that goes through what we're going through.

1123
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,420
 You know, we were told that in the last days,

1124
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,840
 difficult times will come,

1125
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,360
 and men will become lovers of self.

1126
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,100
 And so here's what I would offer to you,

1127
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,120
 just a couple of quick points.

1128
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,340
 Number one, don't panic.

1129
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,580
 Don't panic, man.

1130
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,280
 But let's start with just praying.

1131
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,620
 First Timothy chapter two says this.

1132
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,020
 First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers

1133
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,180
 and petitions and thanksgivings be made for all men.

1134
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,120
 First Timothy two.

1135
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,900
 And especially those who are in authority,

1136
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,220
 so that we may lay a quiet and tranquil life

1137
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,800
 in all godliness and dignity.

1138
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,420
 Because this is good.

1139
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,260
 You see this?

1140
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,420
 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.

1141
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,700
 He wants kids to live lives of peace,

1142
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,020
 not rebellion and anarchy,

1143
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,820
 not raging against the man,

1144
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:50,380
 but following men that seek justice,

1145
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,300
 do good, serve God,

1146
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,840
 and honor the righteous king.

1147
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,320
 So we wanna pray.

1148
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:03,140
 We wanna be people who, as it says in Jeremiah 29,

1149
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,460
 seek the welfare of the city in which we live in.

1150
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,060
 And so part of seeking the welfare

1151
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,820
 is that we speak with informed tongues,

1152
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,140
 and we propose a better way.

1153
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,940
 And we say, guys, I know that kinda,

1154
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,460
 you know, the prevailing wisdom of the day

1155
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,660
 is, you know, kinda try before you buy and live together,

1156
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,820
 but let me just tell you, from a sociological perspective,

1157
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,780
 that's not working out well for people.

1158
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:28,340
 I know that our generation has been told

1159
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,020
 and sold a bill of lies that if we feel a certain way,

1160
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,580
 we should chase it, but let me just tell you,

1161
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,780
 that doesn't go well with anybody.

1162
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,500
 That's the way that children live.

1163
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,500
 Not people who stand firm and act like men,

1164
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,900
 and let everything they do be done in love,

1165
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,620
 not in lust and licentiousness.

1166
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:51,020
 Colossians chapter four says this,

1167
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,140
 devote yourself to prayer,

1168
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,340
 keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving,

1169
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,140
 praying at the same time

1170
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,980
 for those that are also participating

1171
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,040
 in trying to prevail polity and righteousness,

1172
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,020
 that God will open to us a door

1173
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,180
 for the words that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,

1174
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,180
 for which Paul at this time had been in prison.

1175
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,180
 He said, pray that we'd speak clearly and winsomely.

1176
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,220
 Pray that God would let it be obvious to me

1177
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,120
 in the way I ought to speak,

1178
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,600
 and then meanwhile, all of us,

1179
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,940
 let's conduct ourself with wisdom toward outsiders,

1180
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,500
 making the most of every opportunity.

1181
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,060
 Let our speech always be with grace,

1182
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,180
 seasoned with salt, as it were,

1183
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,300
 so that we'll know how to speak to every person.

1184
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,260
 So gang, we need to pray.

1185
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,520
 And need to be people that aren't panicking,

1186
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,700
 aren't surprised, but we pray.

1187
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,500
 Secondly, we want to purify ourself.

1188
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,500
 We want to lead from moral authority.

1189
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,260
 This is what the scripture says

1190
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,980
 in first Peter chapter three, verse 15, it says,

1191
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,460
 but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts.

1192
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,620
 In other words, if you're gonna call people to light,

1193
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,380
 you don't want to be people who keep living in darkness.

1194
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,260
 It doesn't mean you're gonna be perfect.

1195
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:03,100
 Hypocrites, people who sin are not hypocrites.

1196
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,260
 You need to know that.

1197
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,080
 People who say something is wrong

1198
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,540
 and then do it as if it's right, that's a hypocrite.

1199
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,260
 Somebody who makes a mistake and goes, that's a mistake,

1200
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,660
 that's not a hypocrite.

1201
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,700
 That's human.

1202
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,060
 And as you mature, you become less and less

1203
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,200
 prone to those mistakes.

1204
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,500
 You discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.

1205
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,160
 You sanctify yourself as a follower of God who is good.

1206
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,700
 And you follow the Lord in your heart,

1207
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,420
 always being ready to make a defense.

1208
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,160
 When anyone asks you to give an account for the hope

1209
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,020
 that is in you, and you do it with gentleness and reverence,

1210
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,980
 and you keep, it says in verse 16, a good conscience.

1211
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,780
 So the thing in which you're slandered

1212
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,100
 as people who are oppressive and who think

1213
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,900
 that they're more self-righteous than other people,

1214
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,740
 the thing in which you are slandered,

1215
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,980
 those who revile your good behavior in Christ

1216
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,340
 will eventually be put to shame.

1217
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,180
 In other words, just what Jesus did when he was accused.

1218
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,580
 He just said, hey man, look.

1219
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:02,060
 Wisdom will vindicate itself by our deeds.

1220
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,760
 If you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing.

1221
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,920
 Vote for that candidate.

1222
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,300
 But I'm just gonna tell you, if you keep doing

1223
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,780
 what you're doing, you're not gonna like what you got.

1224
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,220
 And so, I'm gonna suffer if I'm in a land

1225
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,620
 where the majority of people want to pursue

1226
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,560
 a lack of wisdom and unrighteousness.

1227
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,060
 And I'm gonna love you and not be angry

1228
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,560
 and be forgiving towards you, but I'm gonna just

1229
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,060
 keep telling you there's a better way.

1230
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,620
 And I'm gonna live in this land that is letting

1231
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,020
 perversity and evil be the rule and the law of the land.

1232
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,180
 I'm not gonna participate in that.

1233
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,740
 And you may mock me because I judge you,

1234
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,860
 but eventually you're gonna come back to me.

1235
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,340
 And you're gonna go, you know what?

1236
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,020
 There's something about your home

1237
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,540
 that's different than my home.

1238
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,640
 There's something about your leadership

1239
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,780
 that's different than my leadership.

1240
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,840
 There's something about your love

1241
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,740
 that's different than my lack of love.

1242
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,940
 Would you teach me more of your will and way?

1243
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,940
 So we pray.

1244
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,460
 And we purify ourself.

1245
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,700
 And then gang, I'll just end with this.

1246
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,060
 We proclaim.

1247
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,860
 We are heralds of righteousness.

1248
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:10,260
 We are declarationers.

1249
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,900
 First Peter chapter two, verse nine says this.

1250
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,140
 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,

1251
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,220
 a holy nation, a people for God's own possession

1252
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,100
 so that you might proclaim the excellencies

1253
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,300
 of him who has called you out of darkness

1254
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,220
 into his marvelous light.

1255
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,220
 Gang, I wanna tell you something.

1256
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,300
 The reason that our country is in the condition

1257
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,480
 that it's in today is because of the church.

1258
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,840
 This is not a radical homosexual problem.

1259
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,620
 This is not a pro-choice problem.

1260
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,160
 This is not a democratic problem.

1261
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,800
 This is not a republican problem.

1262
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,600
 This is a spiritual problem.

1263
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,760
 And the reason there's a spiritual problem in America

1264
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,880
 is because the church has been weak,

1265
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,560
 ineffective, and compromising.

1266
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:51,760
 Because we don't teach the word of God.

1267
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,740
 We don't sanctify Christ as Lord in our own life.

1268
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,720
 We've either made politics our savior

1269
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,780
 or we've made it our sworn enemy.

1270
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,800
 And both of those are unbiblical.

1271
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,040
 Instead, we're servants of the king

1272
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,720
 who seek the welfare of the city that we're in.

1273
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,180
 And we don't vote for compromised evil people.

1274
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,080
 And when we have evil as the law of the land,

1275
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,240
 we don't participate in it.

1276
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,240
 We live rightly.

1277
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,640
 And we love.

1278
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,520
 And we propose a better way.

1279
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:26,480
 With our speech seasoned with salt, as it were.

1280
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,680
 And we just say, man, listen,

1281
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,200
 I think what you're doing is wrong.

1282
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,400
 I think it's gonna hurt you.

1283
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,560
 But I'm gonna love you.

1284
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,760
 And I'm gonna live my life this way.

1285
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,800
 You live your life that way.

1286
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,480
 If that's what you wanna do, I'm not gonna endorse it.

1287
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,320
 I'm not gonna condone it.

1288
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,240
 I'm not gonna call it right.

1289
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,760
 I'm not gonna participate in the craziness

1290
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,160
 of the spirit of the age.

1291
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:49,700
 I'm gonna represent the one who created the age.

1292
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,120
 The ancient of days.

1293
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,800
 And I'm gonna tell you he's good.

1294
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,400
 And he loves you.

1295
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,520
 And there's a way out.

1296
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,840
 Pray.

1297
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,240
 Purify.

1298
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,080
 Proclaim.

1299
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,480
 Participate.

1300
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,320
 Step up.

1301
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,600
 Speak out.

1302
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,000
 Stand firm.

1303
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,780
 Stay humble.

1304
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,620
 Serve the king.

1305
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,840
 Father, I pray that this is the generation right here

1306
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,400
 where we turn this mess around.

1307
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,800
 That we stop being children who think

1308
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,640
 that we don't have to do anything

1309
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,840
 and someone else will take care of us.

1310
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,840
 That we stop being small-minded and think

1311
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,400
 that there is no law that we're in any way

1312
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,040
 accountable to or responsible for.

1313
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,880
 We know better.

1314
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,280
 We know we reap what we sow.

1315
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,560
 And we just keep kicking the can down the road.

1316
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,680
 And our parents did it and they seemed

1317
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,800
 to quote unquote get away from it

1318
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,600
 even though we were miserable growing up underneath it.

1319
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,680
 We know there's a real debt that's there.

1320
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,880
 We know it's just a matter of time

1321
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,960
 before the world gets its piece of us

1322
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,680
 and says your devalued currency,

1323
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:50,960
 which is the rule and the law

1324
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,080
 and the monetary system of the world,

1325
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,000
 is just a joke.

1326
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,760
 And if we could, we'd come get you.

1327
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,240
 And so Lord, I pray we'd start to live

1328
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,160
 austere, wise, humble lives.

1329
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,720
 Not be bullies.

1330
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,740
 Not be arrogant.

1331
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,720
 I pray we wouldn't be hopeless either.

1332
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,120
 But we would do exactly what the scripture says.

1333
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,520
 We would honor the king.

1334
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,200
 We'd pray.

1335
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,640
 We'd sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts.

1336
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,520
 And we would live our lives in a holy way

1337
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,600
 before the people.

1338
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,280
 Proposing to them a better way

1339
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,800
 that you have shown us because you're good,

1340
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,360
 your word is true.

1341
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,400
 And following you is a blessing in Jesus' name.

1342
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,240
 Amen.
