1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,480
 He makes me lie down in green pastures, He leads me beside still waters.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,400
 He restores my soul, He leads me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,080
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,360
 are with me.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,400
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,060
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,600
 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,360
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,400
 in the house of the Lord forever."

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,560
 What's up Porch, how are we doing tonight?

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,120
 Hey, it's so good to see you.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,160
 Hope all is well.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,120
 Whether this is your first time or your last time at the Porch, I am so glad that you made

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
 it.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560
 My name is Timothy Atik, I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark on Sundays as well

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
 as here at the Porch.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,720
 Hello to everyone watching at a Porch Live location tonight.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,820
 I'm so glad that you are tuning in with us wherever you are at.

20
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,600
 So here's the deal.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,520
 Some of you know this, not everyone knows this.

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,720
 You might have watched a Netflix documentary on this, but in 2017 there was a 26-year-old

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,960
 entrepreneur named Billy McFarlane who came up with an idea.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,400
 So he got together with a rapper friend named Ja Rule, and the two of them decided that

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:49,480
 they were going to try and throw an epic music festival on an island in the Bahamas called

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,240
 Fire Fest.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,680
 So what they did is they went to this island in the Bahamas with some models and they took

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:06,560
 some pictures of these models on white sandy beaches, and then they asked some influencers

29
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:15,440
 to promote that they are having a concert on a private island in the Bahamas where Blink-182

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
 is going to come and different musical artists are going to come, and it's going to be this

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,220
 all-exclusive, luxurious, epic three-day weekend.

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,860
 So people began to push it on social media, and the thing sold out just like that, which

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:40,920
 is amazing, unless you're the organizers who have not planned any logistics yet for a weekend

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,720
 concert that you just sold out.

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,240
 So this 26-year-old Billy McFarlane and this rapper Ja Rule realized that they just sold

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,240
 out a concert that they haven't planned for, and so they began to plan for it, and what

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,240
 they realized is that the island that they had said they were going to hold it on couldn't

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,080
 even hold the amount of people that they had sold tickets to.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,040
 And instead of working the math and making the decision, "This won't work," they instead

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,320
 decided to cross their fingers and hope for the best.

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:24,400
 And so these people left the United States and flew to the Bahamas to be a part of a

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,080
 music festival that had no planning that went into it.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,400
 And so when people showed up, the organizers just started pumping people full of alcohol,

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
 hoping that they wouldn't realize what was happening.

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,560
 And then when night began to fall, people began to wonder, "Where am I staying?"

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,600
 And it is then that everything began to unravel, and people realized that the luxurious cabanas

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:59,360
 that they thought that they had rented were actually hurricane shelter, little pop-ups

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,560
 that were drenched in water, and people began to run for their lives trying to take shelter.

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,200
 The food that they thought they had purchased were actually cheese sandwiches and styrofoam

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,280
 cartons.

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,760
 And so you had these people who were trapped on an island with a festival that they had

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,240
 paid thousands of dollars to attend, and the festival never got going because all the musical

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,840
 artists bailed.

54
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,920
 And so did Billy McFarlane.

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,720
 And so the reason I tell you that is I want you to think about people's experiences at

56
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,940
 Fyre Festival.

57
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,120
 You know what happened?

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,680
 Is their dreams and reality went in two totally different directions.

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,160
 Like they dreamed of a three-day epic weekend with friends, seeing musical artists, taking

60
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,200
 in exotic drinks, meeting new people, and what was reality?

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,000
 They found themselves in an airport desperate to get out with no food and no water.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,400
 The places they thought they would be staying were actually miserable hurricane shelters.

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,800
 Their dreams and reality went in two totally different directions.

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
 And I wonder if that describes your life right now.

65
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:33,400
 Like you are living your very own Fyre Festival where your dreams and your reality are going

66
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,180
 in two totally different directions.

67
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,580
 Like your dreams of being married and your reality, the person you thought you were going

68
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,500
 to be married to just broke up with you, that's a tough place to be.

69
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,520
 Your dreams of crushing it in your job and your reality, you just got let go from that

70
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,760
 job, that's a harsh reality.

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,080
 Your dreams of being physically fit and in the best condition of your life at the age

72
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,280
 of 29 and your reality that you have more health issues than some people in their 50s

73
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,040
 is a harsh reality.

74
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:23,040
 Your dreams of being happy all the time and completely settled in your young adult years

75
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:31,160
 and your reality that you have been in a funk for months now and you just don't feel yourself

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,120
 and you really just don't like being around people and even to come here tonight felt

77
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,520
 like climbing a mountain, that's a harsh reality.

78
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,560
 And we need to talk about it.

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,200
 Like how do we navigate the times, the days, the weeks, the months, the seasons of life

80
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,360
 where our dreams and reality seem to go in two different directions?

81
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,440
 The good news is that we're not left to ourselves to try and figure that out.

82
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,400
 Like the Scriptures talk a lot about it.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,600
 If you're new to the porch, we teach the Bible here.

84
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,760
 The reason that we put so much emphasis on this book is that we believe that God went

85
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,400
 to great lengths to speak to us through this book.

86
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,720
 So when we open this book, it's kind of like we're opening up God's mouth.

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,360
 God speaks to us when we read this book.

88
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,860
 And if you're new, we are in the middle, this is the third week of a series where we're

89
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,440
 going through the most famous chapter in the entire Bible.

90
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 It's Psalm 23.

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,720
 It's most often read at funerals, but this passage is so much more than a funeral passage.

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,360
 It is a passage to life to the full.

93
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,960
 And it's written by a guy named David.

94
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,880
 And David knew what it felt like for his dreams and reality to go in different directions.

95
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,520
 David was a guy who lived on the run for 15 years because a guy was trying to kill him

96
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,880
 and take his life.

97
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,080
 David was a guy who lost his best friend.

98
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,560
 His best friend passed away.

99
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,600
 David had kids and his daughter got raped.

100
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,400
 Four of his kids died prematurely.

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
 He had to bury four of his kids.

102
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,400
 One of his kids rebelled against him and tried to steal the throne from him.

103
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,660
 David had to lead his country through a three-year famine.

104
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,320
 David was a guy who knew what it felt like for his dreams and reality to go in two totally

105
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,880
 different directions.

106
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,560
 And yet these are the words that he writes.

107
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,040
 He writes these words.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,800
 "The Lord is my shepherd.

109
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,580
 I shall not want.

110
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,140
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

111
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,780
 He leads me beside still waters.

112
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,900
 He restores my soul.

113
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,240
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake."

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
 Now watch this.

115
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,340
 Verse four is where we're landing tonight.

116
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,640
 We're just going verse by verse through this passage.

117
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,480
 It's taken us five weeks to do it.

118
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,360
 This is week three.

119
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
 Verse four.

120
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,700
 "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,

121
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,520
 for you are with me.

122
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,140
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

123
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,860
 Not only are we looking at the most famous passages in the Bible, but we're looking at

124
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,420
 the most famous verse in the most famous passage in the Bible.

125
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,300
 "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."

126
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,300
 Why?

127
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,540
 "For you are with me.

128
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,000
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
 And so here's the deal.

130
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
 Let me just ask you, hey, I'm just asking you to be honest.

131
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,640
 You don't have to be honest.

132
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,640
 This is a church, so some people are like, "I definitely can't be honest at church."

133
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,160
 Some of you guys have no problem being honest.

134
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
 If you're in one of those seasons of life where your dreams and reality have gone in

135
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
 two different directions, would you just slip up your hand real quick so I know who I'm

136
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
 talking to?

137
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
 Okay.

138
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,040
 There's a lot of people in this room.

139
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,040
 Hey, I would say that's me too.

140
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,120
 I would say that that's right where I'm at even this week.

141
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,280
 My dreams and reality have gone in two different directions.

142
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,320
 Here's what we want.

143
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,140
 We want our circumstances to change, right?

144
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,360
 That's what we want most.

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,220
 We want our circumstances to change.

146
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,220
 But as we look at Psalm 23 verse 4, what I would argue is that more than our circumstances

147
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,320
 changing, there are three other things that might need to change if you want to navigate

148
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,300
 the path of the valley of the shadow of death.

149
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,740
 The first thing that might need to change is this.

150
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,820
 You might need to change what you believe, okay?

151
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,120
 The first thing that I want to encourage you, if you feel like right now your dreams and

152
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,520
 reality are going in different directions, if you feel like you are in some ways walking

153
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,620
 through the valley of the shadow of death, then I want to encourage you, you might need

154
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,260
 to change what you believe.

155
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,260
 Now that sounds like a big statement.

156
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,500
 You just walked into a church and the guy on stage is telling you, you might need to

157
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,260
 change what you believe.

158
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,900
 Why do I say that?

159
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,820
 Well, I told you that King David is writing this passage.

160
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,780
 Who was David to God?

161
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:31,740
 God looked at David and gave David a title.

162
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,620
 Here's the title God gave to David.

163
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,620
 God referred to David as the man after my own heart.

164
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:45,340
 It's a pretty big compliment when the God of the universe looks at David and says, "You

165
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,940
 know who you are?

166
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,260
 You know who you will be?

167
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,820
 You will be the man after my own heart."

168
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,660
 But God had a deep affection for David.

169
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,100
 He made David king of his people, the nation of Israel.

170
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:10,580
 And yet David, the man after God's own heart, God's king, the guy that God had made king,

171
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,660
 he's the one saying that he is walking through the valley of the shadow of death.

172
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,860
 Do you know what that tells us?

173
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,980
 It tells us that bad things happen even to God's people.

174
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,340
 So that's why I say you might need to change what you believe because your belief structure

175
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:35,060
 really might not be able to handle the truth at this point that bad things happen even

176
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,940
 to God's people.

177
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,140
 To just dig down the rabbit hole a little bit more, if you were to look back at what

178
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,860
 David said last week, at the end of verse 3, what does he say?

179
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,240
 He says that his shepherd leads me in paths of righteousness.

180
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,460
 What did we say that means?

181
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,540
 It means that David is saying God leads me in right paths.

182
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:06,060
 And so what David is saying is the right paths in life are the paths that lead to green pastures

183
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,540
 and still waters, and the right paths also lead straight through the valley of the shadow

184
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,980
 of death.

185
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:26,060
 Do your beliefs allow for that type of experience where God can be good for leading you to green

186
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,300
 pastures and quiet waters, and God can still be good when He leads you through the valley

187
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,220
 of the shadow of death?

188
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,540
 Does your beliefs really allow for that?

189
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,580
 Because this is what the Scriptures teach.

190
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,760
 I mean, I think about what Jesus says in John 16, 33.

191
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,180
 What does He say?

192
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,340
 He says, "I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace."

193
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
 Watch what He says.

194
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,060
 Watch His wording.

195
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,180
 He says, "In this world you will have trouble."

196
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,920
 Like, I don't know how Jesus could have been more clear.

197
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,660
 He gathers His friends on the night that He is about to leave them.

198
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,860
 He's like, "All right, guys, bring it in.

199
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,140
 Take a knee.

200
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,360
 In this world you will have trouble."

201
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,860
 So Jesus, let me make sure I'm hearing you.

202
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,380
 If I believe in you, everything's going to go exactly how I want it to go.

203
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,700
 I'm going to get the guy.

204
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,980
 I'm going to get the job.

205
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,500
 I'm going to make the money.

206
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:42,120
 "In this world," hello McFly, is anybody home?

207
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:51,160
 "In this world you will," not you might, not it's a possibility, not if you draw the short

208
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,080
 straw, but you will have trouble.

209
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,160
 Jesus couldn't have said it more clearly, and yet we lose our ever-loving minds and

210
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
 we feel like God has abandoned us.

211
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,560
 He's deserted us when things don't go how we want them to go.

212
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,700
 I've experienced that.

213
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,640
 I've watched other people experience that.

214
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 You know what we want?

215
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,680
 We want karma.

216
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,240
 We want the idea that if you do good, you get good.

217
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,720
 That's the belief system that many of us live with.

218
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,880
 I remember watching a friend in his mid-20s begin dating this girl.

219
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,680
 Did everything right.

220
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
 Did everything right.

221
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,520
 They were dating for months.

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,640
 He's a godly man.

223
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,200
 She's a godly woman.

224
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,500
 He was trying to lead her in a healthy way.

225
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,680
 They were physically pure in their relationship.

226
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,400
 He was very respectful.

227
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,120
 He was very thoughtful.

228
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,400
 Took her on great dates.

229
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,440
 Was trying to do everything that God would want him to do.

230
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,120
 And out of the blue, she broke up with him and ended up not too long from them getting

231
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,180
 together with another guy and they got married.

232
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:06,380
 And I remember this guy just thinking, "I did everything right."

233
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:15,060
 I remember when my close friend, I was in my mid-20s, he passed away serving our country.

234
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:22,780
 And I remember getting the news that he had, the tank he was in ran over an IED and it

235
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,560
 killed him.

236
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,060
 And I remember getting that news and driving down the toll road with tears in my eyes just

237
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,380
 wondering, "God, why would you let this happen?"

238
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,980
 Even recently, within the last few months, there's been various challenges that our family

239
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,800
 has navigated and there's part of me that's just been like, "God, what are you doing?"

240
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
 You know what we want?

241
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,660
 We want God to be like a cosmic-sized vending machine.

242
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,340
 You know where you walk up and you look and it's like E6.

243
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,700
 So you just have to push two buttons, E6.

244
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,060
 So we're like, "As long as I push E, meaning I read my Bible and I pray and I come to the

245
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,340
 porch and as long as I push six, which means I don't do too many stupid things and I try

246
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:15,780
 to live a good life, then what we expect is for God to drop down exactly what we want."

247
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,100
 And yet we live in these moments where the vending machine of heaven gets jammed and

248
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,540
 we're like, "What's going on?"

249
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:34,300
 See Jesus told us, "In this world you will have trouble."

250
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
 My time's not over yet.

251
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,980
 I mean, I know I've been talking a while, but what if y'all did that?

252
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
 What if you all set timers?

253
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,340
 You're like, "They'll all go off when we think you've been talking too long."

254
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,980
 That would be an amazing way to do church.

255
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,100
 Anyway, I want to encourage you to answer this question.

256
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,020
 I'm going to put it on the screen.

257
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,860
 Here's the question.

258
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:06,900
 Can God lead you through a moment or season of deep darkness and still be fully good,

259
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,820
 trustworthy, faithful, and worthy of your life and worship?

260
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,980
 David says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death."

261
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,020
 Another way of saying that is, "Even though I walk through deep darkness."

262
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,020
 Like David is writing about a time in his life of deep darkness.

263
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:36,860
 Like it's possible that his life was even on the line when he was writing this, and

264
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,120
 yet he still saw his shepherd as good.

265
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,580
 This is the question that I have my kids pondering right now.

266
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,780
 This is a big one for our family.

267
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,180
 Like we sat at night, what we do when we sit around the dinner table, we don't do this

268
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,220
 every night, but when we do have a family dinner, we've got these little flashcards

269
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,980
 of the alphabet.

270
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,340
 And for each letter of the alphabet, there's one attribute of God.

271
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,380
 And so recently we talked about, for P, we talked about God being perfect.

272
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:15,360
 And I asked my kids who really handled our move to Dallas hard, like the move was very

273
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,860
 difficult for them, like very challenging for them, heartbreaking for them.

274
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,460
 And so I asked them, I said, "Hey, do you all believe God's perfect?"

275
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,460
 They're like, "Yes."

276
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,580
 Even moving us to Dallas.

277
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:39,620
 Well, I've got to think about it, because perfect, just because God's perfect doesn't

278
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:52,980
 mean your experience on earth will be perfectly what you want it to be.

279
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,780
 As I've been preparing this series, I read through a book called A Shepherd's Look at

280
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,660
 Psalm 23 by a guy named Philip Keller.

281
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,700
 And here's what he said.

282
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:08,500
 He said, "It's common practice for shepherds to take their flocks to higher country during

283
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,740
 the summer.

284
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,060
 But in order for the shepherd to ascend the mountains with his sheep, he must lead his

285
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,300
 sheep through valleys.

286
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,180
 And the valleys can be places where there are predators, avalanches, poisonous plants,

287
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,100
 storms, and floods along the valley floors.

288
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,820
 In addition, since the sun does not shine into the valley very well, there really are

289
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,220
 shadows which at any moment may become shadows of death."

290
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,100
 So what does this mean for the Christian life?

291
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
 Here's what it means.

292
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:46,220
 It means the path to spiritual mountaintops will inevitably take you through dark valleys.

293
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,660
 Like when you look around and you see really spiritual people, if something in you is like,

294
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,500
 "Man, I just want to be a godly person.

295
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,020
 Like I want to be someone on fire for the Lord."

296
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,060
 Well, just take to heart what A.W.

297
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,460
 Tozer, a famous author and pastor from the 1900s said.

298
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:14,020
 He said, "It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until he has hurt him deeply."

299
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,940
 You know what this means?

300
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:23,740
 It means God isn't just leading you through the valley, He is leading you to new heights.

301
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,820
 He is taking you to new places of intimacy with Him.

302
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:34,980
 He wants you to flourish, but a part of you flourishing might be taking you through places

303
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,820
 of deep darkness.

304
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,300
 Charles Spurgeon, famous pastor from the 1800s said this.

305
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:48,900
 He said, "I have learned to kiss the waves that throw me against the rock of ages."

306
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
 Do you hear what he's saying?

307
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,660
 I've learned to kiss the waves that throw me against the rock of ages.

308
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,580
 Because sometimes when your dreams and reality go in separate directions, it can feel devastating,

309
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,140
 it can feel disappointing, and yet that is where God meets you.

310
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,740
 And He doesn't waste your pain.

311
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,700
 In God's economy, no pain is pointless.

312
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,940
 God can take your pain and He can use it in a very specific way to draw you closer to

313
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,960
 Him for you to see God in ways that you've never seen Him before.

314
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,980
 And so let me just encourage you with this.

315
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,460
 It's interesting because a lot of times when life is good, someone else gets the credit,

316
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,460
 right?

317
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,520
 Like when we get into a relationship and our life feels amazing, like we give the credit

318
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,580
 to the relationship.

319
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,860
 Or when things are going well at work, we give the credit to our hard work or something

320
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
 else.

321
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,100
 Like when life is good, someone else gets the credit, but when life is bad, God gets

322
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,540
 the credit.

323
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,700
 Like we blame God, but when life is good, we celebrate someone or something else or

324
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
 ourselves.

325
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,600
 Here's the reality.

326
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,900
 Change what you believe.

327
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,820
 In this world, you will have trouble.

328
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,180
 And because of that, here's what I want to encourage you to do.

329
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,500
 Be grateful in the good times and be faithful in the tough times.

330
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 That's it.

331
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,040
 That's the key.

332
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,500
 Be grateful in the good times.

333
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,740
 So when life is good, for those of you who didn't raise your hands, your dreams and reality

334
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,460
 are not in two separate directions.

335
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,100
 They're actually synced up.

336
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,760
 Be grateful.

337
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,140
 Get on your knees and praise God for that.

338
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,200
 And if your dreams and reality are going in different directions, be faithful.

339
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,940
 Be faithful.

340
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,660
 Just because you can't see God doing something doesn't mean he's not doing something.

341
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,540
 But you might need to change what you believe.

342
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,660
 We don't believe in karma.

343
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,740
 We believe in a good shepherd who will lead you to green pastures and quiet waters, and

344
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,500
 he will also lead you to the valley of the shadow of death.

345
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,900
 Number two, you might need to change what you fear.

346
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,000
 You might need to change what you fear.

347
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 What does David say?

348
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,900
 He says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death," what's the next words?

349
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,140
 "I will fear no evil."

350
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:32,420
 So he's looking at his deep season of deep darkness and he says, "I will fear no evil."

351
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,260
 Why?

352
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,100
 Why?

353
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,700
 "Because his good shepherd is present and his good shepherd is prepared."

354
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,060
 His good shepherd is present.

355
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,060
 What does David say?

356
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,340
 "I will fear no evil."

357
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
 Why?

358
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,660
 "For you are with me."

359
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:56,100
 See when you realize that your good shepherd is with you, every single inch of the valley

360
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,260
 of the shadow of death, it changes things.

361
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,460
 When you are confident in the character of God and you know that he is with you, it changes

362
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
 things.

363
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,920
 But he's not just present, he's prepared.

364
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,020
 That's why David says, "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

365
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,820
 The rod of the shepherd speaks to the power and the authority of the shepherd.

366
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,420
 See the rod of the shepherd was used to protect the sheep.

367
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:32,560
 It was to fight off predators and the rod was also used to discipline the sheep.

368
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,100
 So that's a reference to the power and authority of the shepherd.

369
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,900
 But he says, "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

370
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,900
 The staff is what we think of when we think of images of shepherds.

371
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,340
 It's what has the crook in it.

372
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,620
 See the staff of the shepherd represented the care and compassion of the shepherd.

373
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:00,140
 The shepherd would use the staff to pull a sheep in close to him to examine him to make

374
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,660
 sure that he or she was okay.

375
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:10,320
 The staff is what was used to pick up a baby lamb to bring it to its mom.

376
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,420
 The staff sometimes, Philip Keller writes, that sometimes the staff was used just to

377
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,580
 touch the side of a sheep to give direction.

378
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,600
 And at other times, if a shepherd had a favorite sheep, sometimes the shepherd would take the

379
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:30,100
 staff and just touch the side of the sheep as a sign of affection to say, "I'm here and

380
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,420
 I care for you."

381
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,580
 And so David is able to say, "I will fear no evil."

382
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,580
 Why?

383
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:43,800
 Because he's confident that his shepherd is present and his shepherd is prepared.

384
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,860
 And so do you believe that God is with you?

385
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,380
 Like, do you firmly believe that God is with you?

386
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,500
 Every minute of every day.

387
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,820
 I know just something that helps put this in perspective for me.

388
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,100
 Several years ago when my oldest son Noah, when he was about four years old, he woke

389
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,820
 up one afternoon from his afternoon nap and he was just screaming his head off.

390
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,980
 And we were like, "All right, well, sometimes this is normal."

391
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,540
 And so we just kind of let him be.

392
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,820
 But it didn't stop.

393
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,260
 Like, it went on for an hour, went on for two hours.

394
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,900
 So this kid, he's just losing his mind for two hours.

395
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,700
 Then we move into the night.

396
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,260
 We move into the evening and he is still crying.

397
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,340
 And so we begin to think through different scenarios.

398
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,140
 Like, what's causing this?

399
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,660
 The options are, number one, he had a bad dream.

400
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,540
 Number two, he doesn't feel well.

401
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,540
 Number three, he's possessed.

402
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
 Like, we don't know.

403
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,340
 Like, we're trying.

404
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,020
 We're all viable, trying to figure it out.

405
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,460
 Didn't seem like it was the first one.

406
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,740
 Didn't seem like it was the second one.

407
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,780
 We were going to go ahead and just hope for the best that it wasn't the third one.

408
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,980
 So I remember we put him in his bed to go to sleep and he's just still losing his mind.

409
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,380
 And so what I do as his dad is I just go and I get my pillow and I get a blanket.

410
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,380
 I walk into his room.

411
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,540
 I pull out his trundle bed and I say, "Hey, dude, I'm going to sleep in here with you."

412
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:24,300
 I lay down and the minute I did, he stopped crying and he fell right to sleep.

413
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:31,820
 And I tell you that just to say the presence of his father changed something.

414
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:40,020
 And when you begin to believe that your God, that the God of the universe, the God where

415
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,900
 Jesus Christ, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are God, that He's

416
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:58,060
 with you, that He loves you, and He is with you every single inch of the valley, it can

417
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,780
 change things.

418
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,560
 Like when you wake up tomorrow morning, He's in your room with you.

419
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,620
 When you are driving your car, He's there.

420
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,220
 When you're at work, He's there.

421
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,980
 He's with you every moment of the day and He's prepared.

422
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,540
 He's prepared with power and authority, but also care and compassion.

423
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,000
 He's prepared for every aspect of your life.

424
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,860
 Do you believe that?

425
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,300
 David was able to say, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

426
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,820
 I will fear no evil."

427
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,100
 He didn't have to fear the valley.

428
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,280
 Why?

429
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,640
 Because he feared his good shepherd.

430
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,780
 That's why I say you might need to change what you fear.

431
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:52,340
 What I'm inviting you to do is to displace your fear from your circumstances to your

432
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,180
 good shepherd.

433
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:01,140
 See a lot of times we position faith as the opposite of fear.

434
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,420
 But faith isn't actually the opposite of fear.

435
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,180
 Faith is the redemption of fear.

436
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
 You're like, "What are you talking about?"

437
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,060
 Well, let me show you.

438
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:17,180
 If you were to look at Mark chapter 4, verses 39 through 41, it's a famous passage that

439
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,660
 we use when we talk about anxiety or the storms of life.

440
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,980
 It's a story about Jesus calming the storm.

441
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,900
 And when Jesus calms the storm, listen to what He says.

442
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,580
 It says in verse 39 that, "He," Jesus, "awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea,

443
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,740
 'Peace be still.'

444
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,420
 And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

445
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,940
 And Jesus said to them, 'Why are you so afraid?

446
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,380
 Have you still no faith?'"

447
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,040
 We're like, "Oh, well, that's the opposite.

448
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,220
 Faith is the opposite of fear."

449
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,360
 But look at what happened with the disciples.

450
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,420
 It says, "And they were filled with," what?

451
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,840
 "Great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this that even the wind and the sea

452
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
 obey Him?'"

453
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 Do you see?

454
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,620
 Their fear was transferred from the sea to the one who was greater than the sea.

455
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,660
 That's the redemption of fear.

456
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,580
 That's faith.

457
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,100
 And so when I tell you, "You might need to change what you fear," what I'm inviting you

458
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:27,820
 to do is to trade up from the fear of your circumstances to the fear of the one who is

459
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,180
 greater than your circumstances.

460
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,780
 That's what I'm talking about.

461
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,380
 So what does it mean to fear God?

462
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,620
 What does it mean to fear God?

463
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:47,000
 Well, fear is what happens when humility and awe get together and have a baby.

464
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,240
 When humility and awe get together, they give birth to fear.

465
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,020
 Fear is what happens when you see God for who He is and you realize who He is and who

466
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,940
 you're not.

467
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,500
 That He's God and you're not.

468
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,240
 That He's big and you're small.

469
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,100
 That He's strong and you're weak.

470
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,540
 That He's in control and you're not.

471
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,780
 That's humility.

472
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,380
 And then you think about awe.

473
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,920
 You stand before Him and you realize He's not just a great God who spoke the universe

474
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,660
 into being.

475
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,800
 That He is in control of all things.

476
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 He's not just great.

477
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,060
 He's also good.

478
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,660
 That He actually cares.

479
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:40,220
 And when you come to God with a posture of humility and awe, the result is fear, which

480
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,260
 is simply redeemed faith.

481
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:55,140
 And the product is not anxiety, but awe, because you look at God instead of your circumstances.

482
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:02,340
 The real picture of this is when Jesus walks on water and invites Peter to do the same.

483
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,380
 Peter begins to walk on water and then he begins to sink.

484
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,580
 Why did he begin to sink?

485
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,500
 Because he began to look at the waters instead of looking at the one who controlled the waters.

486
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,900
 And so I just tell you that to say you might need to change what you fear.

487
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,620
 I know for me just personally, like I have a personality that leans toward anxiety.

488
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,820
 I have taken medication for anxiety at different points in my life.

489
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:34,000
 That's the way my personality leans is toward anxiety.

490
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,380
 And just in the last week, there are things that could cause me fear.

491
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,340
 Like I went to the doctor and the doctor looked at my vocal cords.

492
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,300
 It was like you got a small bump on your vocal cords.

493
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,020
 It was like that's never what you want to hear.

494
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,460
 So tomorrow I go on seven days of vocal rest.

495
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,820
 My wife is so thrilled.

496
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,460
 She's not going to hear from me for seven days.

497
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,220
 But there's room for all sorts of fear.

498
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,900
 Like what's going to happen?

499
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
 What does this mean?

500
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
 Am I going to be able to speak?

501
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,040
 That's what I do for a living.

502
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,820
 And then different things have gone on with our kids in different ways that it's like

503
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,060
 how are they going to turn out?

504
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,780
 They're not going to turn out right.

505
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,740
 They're not going to turn out right.

506
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:33,660
 And it's like I can either fear my circumstances or I can look to the one who is in control

507
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,220
 of.

508
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,940
 He's just greater than my circumstances.

509
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,980
 And he's good.

510
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,200
 And he's great.

511
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,220
 And he's with me.

512
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,280
 And he'll never leave me or forsake me.

513
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,560
 And even if things don't go how I want them to go, in the end it's going to be better

514
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,380
 because it's going to be what he wants, not what I want.

515
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,000
 And so I just want to encourage you to change what you fear.

516
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,160
 And then finally, you might not just need to change what you believe or change what

517
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,240
 you fear.

518
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,080
 I want to invite you to change what you expect.

519
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,120
 What do I mean by that?

520
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,640
 When I talk about what you expect, let's just talk about what our expectations are.

521
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:30,080
 Our expectations or what our anticipation is, is of a day when things are going to be

522
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,520
 normal again.

523
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,960
 Like that's what we expect.

524
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,240
 That's what we're hoping for.

525
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,280
 That's what we're waiting for.

526
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,720
 We're just waiting for the dreams and reality that are going like this to kind of get redirected

527
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,680
 by Google Maps and they're going to find their way back together to where our dreams and

528
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,240
 reality are going in the same direction.

529
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,880
 And that just might be the wrong expectation.

530
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,200
 You might need to change what you expect.

531
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,840
 There's two things that I love from this one verse that I want to highlight for you.

532
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,280
 The first is this.

533
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,280
 I always find it interesting that David says he walks through the valley of the shadow

534
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
 of death.

535
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,160
 Have you ever thought about that?

536
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,480
 Like how would your version read?

537
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:34,840
 The TAV, the Timothy Attik version would read, "Even though I sprinted through the valley

538
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,520
 of the shadow of death."

539
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,400
 It would not read, "Walk, because I can run.

540
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,880
 I ran in high school on track.

541
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,840
 I got the letter jacket to prove it.

542
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:54,600
 About 30 pounds heavier, but still I can run, people."

543
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,080
 What would yours read?

544
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,400
 "Even though I scrape and clawed my way through the valley of the shadow."

545
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,160
 It's like David's not in a hurry.

546
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,800
 He's not in a hurry to get through it.

547
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,600
 Even though I walk, I just walk through the valley of the shadow of death.

548
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,440
 He's not frantic.

549
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,960
 He's not trying to escape it to get back to comfortable green pastures.

550
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:28,200
 As fast as possible, he's on his feet and he's moving one step at a time.

551
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,660
 I find that interesting.

552
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:38,240
 The second thing that I really love about this is the shift in the passage from he to

553
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,100
 you.

554
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,080
 So I don't know if you noticed it, but in the first three verses, look back at the first

555
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
 three verses.

556
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,720
 "The Lord is my shepherd.

557
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
 I shall not want."

558
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
 Watch this.

559
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,560
 "He makes me lie down in green pastures.

560
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,720
 He leads me beside still waters.

561
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,440
 He restores my soul.

562
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,560
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake.

563
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,560
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."

564
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
 Why?

565
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:07,440
 "For you are with me."

566
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,320
 The language goes from distant, "He's doing this," to intimate, "You."

567
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:23,680
 Isn't it interesting that the greatest intimacy often comes through the greatest trials in

568
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,960
 life?

569
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,240
 Sometimes the greatest intimacy with God comes through the greatest trials.

570
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,040
 Why would I say that?

571
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:43,400
 I say that because when life is good, we forget about God.

572
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,120
 When life is hard, we have to make a decision.

573
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:52,040
 We're either going to reject God or we're going to cling to Him.

574
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,960
 And so I'll just say, man, I've shared with you guys before, 2022 was the hardest year

575
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,440
 of my life.

576
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,920
 Hardest year of my life.

577
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:12,920
 And I can say with confidence that I know God better today than I did 12 months ago.

578
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:20,320
 And I am more confident that God is good than I was 12 months ago.

579
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,360
 And it hasn't been an easy week.

580
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,240
 It hasn't been an easy week at all.

581
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,920
 The next week, I already know it's going to be a very difficult week, but I am more confident

582
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:41,240
 than ever that God is good, even in the midst of the trials, because there's an intimacy

583
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,800
 that I've gotten to experience with Him.

584
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,560
 Because for an extended part of 2022, I looked to my circumstances for my joy.

585
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,640
 And when I did, I lost my joy because there was no joy to be found in my circumstances.

586
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,040
 I was probably on the verge of depression.

587
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:11,880
 And then Psalm 34, I read it and it said this, "Those who look to Him are radiant."

588
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:19,160
 David says, "I sought the Lord and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears.

589
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,640
 Those who look to Him are radiant."

590
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,360
 And I realized I'm not radiant.

591
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,080
 I'm borderline depressed.

592
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,200
 And I began to turn my eyes back to the Lord and He restored my joy.

593
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,600
 And so even now when not everything is exactly how I want it to be, my dreams and reality,

594
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,320
 at least this week, are going in different directions.

595
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,160
 And yet I can tell you, I have my joy.

596
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,720
 My joy is intact.

597
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,840
 Why?

598
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,080
 Because He's still good.

599
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,940
 He's the good shepherd.

600
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,760
 He is present and He is prepared.

601
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,280
 His rod and His staff, they comfort me.

602
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,560
 And they can comfort you as well.

603
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
 You know, it's interesting.

604
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,920
 If you think back to how I started, I started talking about fire festival.

605
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,880
 So if you were to take that analogy and you were to apply it to your life, doesn't that

606
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,920
 make God the organizer?

607
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,800
 Like you see the flaw with the analogy, right?

608
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:30,600
 Because now I've put God in the position of this 26-year-old entrepreneur who made a mess

609
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
 of things.

610
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,480
 Here's the difference.

611
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,400
 Billy McFarland did no planning.

612
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,600
 Jesus said, "In this world you will have trouble, but take heart."

613
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,200
 Why?

614
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,480
 I have overcome the world.

615
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,400
 How did He overcome the world?

616
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:02,360
 Well, Jesus walked through the Kidron Valley to the Garden of Gethsemane where He would

617
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,120
 pray as the good shepherd.

618
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,920
 It was in the Garden of Gethsemane where as the good shepherd, He would tell the Father,

619
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,040
 "Not my will, but Your will be done."

620
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,160
 He would lay down His life as a good shepherd.

621
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,120
 And then He would be arrested in that garden and led back through the Kidron Valley, led

622
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,800
 like a sheep to the slaughter.

623
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:31,280
 See He walked through the valley of the shadow of death, once as a good shepherd and the

624
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,040
 other as the Lamb of God who would take away the sins of the world because He would go

625
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,520
 to the cross and it was on that cross and it was through His empty tomb that we just

626
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:48,840
 celebrated on Sunday that He would conquer Satan, sin, and death.

627
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:57,640
 And so we can look to Jesus with confidence and expectation because He has already overcome

628
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
 the world.

629
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,240
 So we don't have to have our best life now because our short stay here on earth is but

630
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,760
 a few mere years, but a day is coming where He will come and He will take us to where

631
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
 He is.

632
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,600
 In Revelation 21 it's clear that for those who know Jesus, a day is coming where there

633
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,480
 will be no more pain, no more tears, no more death because the old has passed away and

634
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
 the new has come.

635
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,080
 Jesus Christ is the one who has overcome the grave.

636
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:33,480
 He has conquered sin and death and He will make all things new.

637
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:40,200
 And He, according to the Scriptures, is the good shepherd who laid down His life for His

638
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
 sheep.

639
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,840
 So I just ask you, do you know Him?

640
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
 Do you know Him?

641
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,040
 If you don't know Him, what's keeping you from knowing Jesus Christ?

642
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,440
 Like if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, what's keeping you from Christianity?

643
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,960
 What's keeping you from Jesus?

644
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,800
 Figure that out tonight.

645
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,240
 Wrestle with that truth tonight.

646
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:12,640
 And if you know Jesus and yet you're not clinging to Him, let me just say He's trustworthy.

647
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,960
 He's with you.

648
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,340
 He's for you.

649
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,600
 He's present.

650
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,960
 He's prepared.

651
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,680
 Would you trust Him tonight?

652
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,680
 Let's pray together.

653
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:41,240
 If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ and yet you

654
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:48,120
 realize what Jesus has done for you, that He died on a cross for you, He rose from the

655
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:53,720
 dead conquering all of your sin.

656
00:44:53,720 --> 00:45:01,080
 And He did that to bring you into a right relationship with God.

657
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,480
 If you want to know Jesus Christ tonight, if you want to be made right with God, if

658
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,640
 that's you, I just invite you in this moment, just in the quietness of your own heart, there's

659
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,280
 no magical words.

660
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,640
 It's just you saying what you believe to be true.

661
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,040
 It can go something like this.

662
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:27,400
 You can just repeat after me, just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?

663
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,460
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

664
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,840
 Thank you, Jesus, that you rose from the dead for me.

665
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,160
 Would you come into my life?

666
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,640
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

667
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:55,000
 And would you begin to lead me in a new life with you as my Savior and as my King?"

668
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:06,240
 Just say these words, say, "Jesus, I give my life to you tonight."

669
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:14,520
 And if you're here and your dreams and reality are going in two different directions, I just

670
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,680
 want to invite you in this moment to just tell God, just say, "I trust you."

671
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,000
 Just say that.

672
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,360
 Just say those words, "I trust you.

673
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:33,720
 I trust you."

674
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,720
 And this is just a moment for you to do business with the Lord.

675
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:44,920
 If there's any ways where your beliefs need to be changed, maybe you've been living for

676
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:56,880
 karma more than Christ, maybe you just confess that to Him and you invite His healing in.

677
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,120
 Just do business with the Lord.

678
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,320
 Lord Jesus, we need you.

679
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
 We love you.

680
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,720
 We just pray that you, by the power of your Spirit, would have your way in our hearts

681
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,720
 tonight.

682
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,360
 We thank you that you are the Good Shepherd who laid down His life for the sheep.

683
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,280
 God, I thank you that even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

684
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,560
 we don't have to fear evil, for you are with us.

685
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,360
 And you're right in your step to comfort us.

686
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
 We need you.

687
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,800
 In Jesus' name.

688
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:34,800
