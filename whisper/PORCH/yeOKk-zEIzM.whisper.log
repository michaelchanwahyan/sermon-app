[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.880]   - All right, let's go.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Houston.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880]   I know you guys have been meeting here.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480]   I love y'all too.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.800]   Welcome friends in Northwest Fayetteville, Arkansas,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.600]   and the other 13 live locations.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.520]   I know Fort Worth tonight is also gathering.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.200]   So depending on where you're at,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.960]   welcome everyone and everybody just tuning in from online.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.160]   It has been a minute and gosh, man,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.280]   it is good to see you guys.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.800]   And like JD said, some of y'all,
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.400]   you guys got plans after time or something.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.800]   Hey, I'm gonna welcome you to something
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.020]   that happened recently in my life
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.760]   since last time we were all together.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.040]   I do pretty much the same thing every single day
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.480]   after I get home from work.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.400]   I go into the house, I kiss my wife, kiss my kids,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.640]   and then I take our 130 pound Rhodesian Ridgeback on a walk.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.580]   Now I don't walk and I don't run.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.920]   So I have a longboard.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.160]   Yes, just like that 14 year old that you grew up with.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.500]   And I take him on the longboard.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.120]   We have a shock collar.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.920]   Don't email me, he never gets shocked.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.000]   He's like a big baby elephant
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.360]   that you gotta take on a walk once a day.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.720]   And I take him on one lap around the block,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.800]   get on the longboard, hop on there, no leash.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.240]   He just follows right behind me.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.160]   I finish it and then we go inside.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.280]   A couple days ago I was doing that, got home,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   took the lap with the dog and I went up to the house
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.520]   and I was about to go inside and I smelled smoke.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.880]   And you know when you have that experience
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.220]   where you could smell, it was like six o'clock at night,
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.460]   and there's a difference when you smell
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.640]   something like grilling steaks.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.240]   It smells like hickory, you're like,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.080]   man, that sounds great.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.400]   And then we've all smelled what is clearly
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.920]   like something is burning around here,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.840]   like significantly burning.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.880]   So I begin to go, is somewhere on our house
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.000]   something on fire?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   And I begin to look around the outside
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.200]   of the perimeter of the house and look through
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.940]   and be like, man, 'cause that's not a good thing.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.120]   Anytime that happens, where is this smell coming from?
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.800]   I mean, really strong smell.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.920]   And I get around the house and I don't see anything
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.800]   and so I begin to kind of wonder,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.560]   is there something on with the neighbor's house?
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.440]   And I go over, I'm in my alley,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.600]   behind my neighbor's house and between my house
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.320]   and I see clearly smoke coming up from the backyard.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.560]   And not just like any smoke, like,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   oh, maybe they're doing s'mores.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.220]   You know, that's what people do in June.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.600]   Like a thick, white, billowing cloud of smoke.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.520]   Like clearly something is burning over there
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.640]   and I'm beginning to go like,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.160]   man, what is possibly going on?
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.440]   And I come up to the fence and I didn't wanna just like
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.360]   open their gate and go into their backyard like,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.080]   hey, it's the neighbors, we're coming over.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.920]   If they were just, I don't know what they could've
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.060]   been doing, but I couldn't see.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.180]   So I go up to the fence and I begin to just like
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.720]   try to peek over and see what's going on,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.880]   hoping there's no one like sunbathing nude
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.720]   or something going on.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.000]   And I begin to like look over and which clearly,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.440]   if they're doing that and they have smoke,
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.320]   they've got more problems than we can talk about here.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   But anyway, so I begin to like try to look at the fence,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.320]   but it was too tall, it was a really high fence.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.220]   So it was one of those moments where, guys,
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.120]   at least you've all experienced this when you were a kid
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.360]   and you threw a ball over the fence
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.180]   and you had to like hop over, where I'm jumping up
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.120]   to try and hold myself for a second just to see
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.560]   and I keep jumping up to hold myself,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.120]   hoping that no one's looking out the window
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.960]   like who's this psychopath that is jumping over our fence?
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.160]   And all I can see is smoke.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.360]   I mean like thick, white smoke.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.440]   I can't see the fire.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.080]   And 'cause as far as I could get up there,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.400]   I couldn't see what was down below.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.160]   And so I take the dog, the baby elephant,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.480]   take him back home, put him inside and I'm like,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.120]   hey, talking to my wife, I'm gonna go check on,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.400]   there's something burning in the neighbor's yard.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.600]   And by the time I got back over there,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.800]   you know, maybe they had seen me jumping over,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.560]   someone had put the fire out.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.920]   And I still never quite figured out exactly
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080]   what was taking place back there.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   But the reason I start there is because in that moment,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.940]   I know that there's a fire that is taking place.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.200]   And fire is not necessarily one of those bad things
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.440]   where anytime it's present, you're like,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.800]   hey, this is an emergency,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.400]   we need to make sure that we put that out.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.080]   Fire can be a great thing.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.920]   It's not inherently a bad thing.
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.440]   A fire in a fire pit in your backyard can be awesome.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.760]   A fire moving through your property,
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.240]   burning the fence or burning your house
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.480]   is an incredibly destructive thing.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.440]   But it's not inherently or not always
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.880]   necessarily a bad thing.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   It depends on what the source of the fire is,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.240]   on why there's a fire there, on what it's burning.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.480]   What does it have to do with seven deadly sins?
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.460]   Tonight, we're gonna talk about a deadly sin
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.840]   that is very similar to fire.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.080]   And that it's not inherently,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.840]   every time it's there, a bad thing.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.840]   There's plenty of times when it's appropriate to be there.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   But if unchecked or if there for the wrong reason
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.760]   or expressed in the wrong way,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.120]   just like a fire is incredibly destructive.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.460]   And that seventh deadly sin
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.900]   or that one of the deadly sins is anger.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.520]   Anger is one of those things that inside of your life,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.720]   it's not always a wrong thing, there are appropriate times.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.280]   The Bible says God is angry at times in Scripture.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.180]   Specifically at an injustice in our world.
[00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.000]   You can't love someone and not experience anger, right?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.120]   Like if I love someone and someone is hurting them
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   or abusing them, I would rightly feel anger,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.380]   righteous anger towards that person.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.960]   We're told that God feels that.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.080]   There's appropriate times to have anger,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   it's not always bad.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.920]   And when you look at the news
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.360]   and you see what happens with George Floyd,
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.600]   you should appropriately feel anger.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   That is wrong, not okay.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.500]   There's appropriate experiences of anger.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.200]   But at the same time,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.640]   there's also not appropriate experiences of anger
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.460]   or expressions of anger.
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.520]   There's sinful anger that can take place.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.280]   It depends on what the source, what the cause,
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.120]   what's taking place.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.640]   Tonight, we're not talking about righteous anger.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.840]   We're gonna talk about the deadly sin of sinful anger.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.320]   Because I'm like, several,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.760]   or really all of them can be toxic,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.300]   but this one in particular,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.340]   the effects are seen and are rippling
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.640]   all throughout our culture
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.680]   of anger being experienced
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.780]   and not knowing how to express it.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.080]   And what we're about to talk about tonight,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.880]   I promise you this,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.360]   if just Christians would apply the things
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.760]   that we're gonna look at,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.060]   myself, you, if you claim to be a follower of Jesus,
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.760]   if just us would apply the teaching of Jesus
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.120]   on what relates to this, our world would change.
[00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.140]   It's one of the things that it's impossible
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.220]   to not look around.
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.220]   People are angry about corona.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.460]   People are angry about their job.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.220]   People are angry about the fact that they can't work.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.860]   People are angry about the fact that they are work.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.700]   People are angry about the fact
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.220]   that we're streaming or we're meeting right now.
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.140]   People are angry about any list of things.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.100]   And oftentimes, sinful anger can grab our hearts,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.940]   and anytime it does, it is devastating,
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.960]   and it is destructive.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.260]   And this will destroy your marriage
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.420]   if you allow it to.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.900]   It'll destroy your relationships if you allow it to,
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.060]   but it doesn't have to.
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.820]   So we're gonna look at three things in the Scripture.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.060]   What is the root of anger?
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.440]   'Cause I think it'll surprise you.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.900]   And we're gonna look at the results
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.060]   over and over the Scripture say,
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.720]   if you don't deal with your anger, that will take place.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.880]   And then look at the remedy
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.500]   that God uniquely provides in our world,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.540]   unlike any other remedy that our world has to offer.
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.820]   So we're gonna look at the roots.
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.820]   If you take notes, the roots, the results, and the remedy.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.340]   The first one, the root of sinful anger.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.340]   Let me ask a few questions before we go in there,
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.100]   because the challenge with anger is it kind of masks itself.
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.700]   So most people are like, look, I'm not angry,
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.700]   I'm just frustrated.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.300]   I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.700]   I'm not angry, and it kind of masks
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.580]   behind these little things.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.220]   But here's some ways that you may know that you're angry.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.140]   Is there anyone in your life
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.140]   that a part of you hopes that they fail,
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.460]   or they suffer?
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.100]   You got some anger, bitterness buried in your heart.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.820]   Is there anyone whose name, when you bring them up,
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.380]   it makes you upset?
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.620]   Thinking about what they did makes you upset.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.500]   Anger and bitterness have taken root.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.740]   Is there anyone who you would avoid in public,
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.780]   or you wouldn't wanna go to that party,
[00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.140]   you wouldn't wanna go there or go to that dinner
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.820]   if they were around, because if something
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.020]   that happened between you, there's anger.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.620]   Is there anyone you're waiting, maybe it's a family member,
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.500]   maybe it's a friend, maybe it's an old roommate,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.300]   you're waiting to let back into your life
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.460]   'til they apologize and say what they did,
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.580]   or pay back for what they did?
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.220]   There's anger that's taken place.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.980]   You can't always tell on the outside.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.940]   A lot of times, the most angry people,
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.220]   they're just totally internal, and they just replay tapes
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.100]   over and over in their head.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.580]   They got these constant kind of battles
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.540]   going on in their mind, and they wouldn't think
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.020]   of themselves as angry, 'cause they're not
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.060]   very vocal about it, but there's anger
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.660]   buried in their heart, oftentimes leading them
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.500]   to keep those feelings to themselves,
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.260]   which only makes it worse.
[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.000]   So the root of sinful anger, where does it come from?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.620]   Jesus says this in Mark chapter seven, verse 21.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.740]   For it is within and out of a person's heart
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.040]   that evil thoughts come.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.700]   Wait a second, thoughts come from your heart?
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.820]   Jesus, I think you mean the mind.
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.660]   The Bible, over and over, when it talks about the heart
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.200]   and the mind, it just kinda talks about the control center,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.780]   the command center of your operating system,
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.820]   if you will, of your things.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.300]   When it says hearts, thoughts come out of the hearts.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.060]   Well, what's surprising is what he mentions next.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.500]   Here's the evil thoughts that come out of your heart.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.340]   Sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:30.500]   malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.180]   arrogance, and folly.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.740]   Wait a second, Jesus, those are all actions.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.680]   What do you mean that those are evil thoughts?
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.500]   Jesus says every evil action comes from an evil thought
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.820]   that has taken place in the mind,
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.760]   and all of that comes from the heart.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.860]   All of these are evils, and they come from inside,
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.820]   and they defile a person.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.000]   Jesus says sinful anger, what leads to malice,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.860]   what leads to murder, comes from within the heart.
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.620]   In other words, typically, when I get angry, I get upset,
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.260]   I usually don't think, oh man,
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.900]   there's something going on inside of me.
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.860]   I think this person lied to me.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.780]   This person took credit for something that they didn't do.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.060]   This person cut me off in traffic,
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.540]   and they need to learn how to drive.
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.660]   I think that the expressions of anger come from the outside,
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.860]   and Jesus says, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.840]   Anger comes from within.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.460]   You may go through life, and it'll trigger it.
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.620]   Stress will trigger your anger,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.860]   and all of a sudden, you're just really overwhelmed at work,
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.580]   and you explode on your roommate,
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.020]   or you lash out at a friend.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.420]   Jesus would say, that's not because of the stress,
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.980]   that's because you have something broken
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.820]   inside of your heart.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.220]   The root of your anger comes from within.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.900]   If you don't fix that, you cannot fix your anger.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.580]   Jesus' baby brother, James,
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.300]   his baby brother was not named Jesus,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.460]   that would be interesting.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.860]   James, at some point in his life, trusted in Christ.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.700]   We don't have time to go into that,
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.400]   but how crazy is that, his little brother?
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.820]   And he writes a book called the Book of James.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.100]   In the fourth chapter of that book,
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.260]   listen to what he says about what causes conflict,
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.580]   causes division, causes fights.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.500]   "What causes fights and quarrels among you?"
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.060]   Well, James, let me give you the answer.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.540]   She was mean.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.720]   She was hurtful.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.860]   They didn't respond.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.820]   They didn't invite me to come.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.660]   Nope.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.420]   They come from your desires that battle within you.
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.820]   You desire, but you do not have, so you kill.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.020]   And James is exaggerating.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.360]   He's saying, you desire, so you don't have, so you kill.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.780]   And all of a sudden, you go, no, no, no, I'm never killed.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.180]   The same expression that leads to killing someone
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:35.580]   is anger, hatred, bitterness.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.140]   And James says, all of that anger,
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.180]   it doesn't come from the outside.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.140]   It doesn't come from what was done
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.740]   or wasn't done against you.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.980]   It comes from within.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.300]   In Hebrews chapter 12, verse 15, it says this.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.780]   "See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.260]   "and that no bitter root grows up
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.740]   "and causes trouble and defiles many."
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.340]   The Bible says, like, bitterness,
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.300]   think about this, it's so brilliant.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.780]   It's like a root that'll come in your life,
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.220]   and as it grows, it begins to impact your life.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.100]   Why is that brilliant?
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.060]   Because what's a root?
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.140]   A root is something that, you know,
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.100]   the roots of a plant, the roots of a flower
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.300]   are something beneath the surface.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.640]   You can't see 'em, but they're impacting everything
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.020]   that you can see on the surface.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.380]   It's what the author of Hebrews says,
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.480]   you know, that's like what bitterness is like.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.340]   It's this thing that is beneath the surface,
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.220]   and it just gets buried underneath there,
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.980]   and somebody called you a name in sixth grade,
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.980]   and every time now anybody insults the way
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.380]   that you look on the outside,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.620]   so there's a root of bitterness that's growing underneath,
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.260]   and you can't see it, but it's buried there,
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.500]   and it's affecting everything,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.620]   just like the roots of a flower affect everything
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.380]   that you can see above the surface.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.660]   That root of bitterness is gonna affect everything
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.260]   above the surface in your life,
[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.260]   and if you want to deal with anger, or sinful anger,
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.860]   it involves dealing with it at a heart level.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.420]   In other words, the temptation will always be,
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.580]   or often be, to think that anger is something
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.520]   that is caused by other people around us,
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.640]   as though like, you know, I'm justified in what I did
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.660]   because of, you know, the actions that they took.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.000]   My roommate, all of a sudden, I come home,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   we've been sharing a room for a while,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.040]   I've told him so many times, when you wash the dishes,
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.280]   and you get dishes in there,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.160]   make sure that you don't leave it out
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.600]   because your little crusty noodles
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.440]   end up caking to the outside of the metal,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.000]   and it's disgusting, and how many times,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.240]   what am I, your mom right now?
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.800]   And you think that, man, I'm angry because of that.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.960]   Jesus says, no, no, no.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.240]   Anger comes from within,
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.320]   as though like this would be you and I's heart,
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.440]   and inside of it has a potential,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.160]   and the capacity to carry around anger,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.440]   and then something triggers it,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.720]   where a roommate comes out, and comes all of a sudden,
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.800]   and they failed to, you know,
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.100]   clean up the dishes that they had,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.000]   or they borrowed your clothes without even asking,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.640]   and all of a sudden, boom, and it pops out,
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.680]   and it's not because of something that they did.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.000]   What they did just triggered the anger
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.820]   that is already inside of your heart to come out.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.660]   This is the way the Bible talks about it,
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.800]   that you'll be going along, and road rage.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.480]   People are driving, and you think it's because,
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.600]   look, you're driving, we're going up 75,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.560]   and we're locked gridlock here,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.160]   and everyone, if you could just learn how to drive,
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.640]   and you explode, and you think it's because
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.400]   people don't know how to drive.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.200]   You think it's because people,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.520]   if we could all just drive 70 people,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.760]   the problem would go away.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.520]   And James says, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.280]   Jesus says, no, the anger, it's already in there.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.800]   Those are just triggers that are bringing it
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.040]   out to the surface.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.900]   At work, where you snap, and you respond to a coworker,
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.540]   or to your boss, or you lash out with an email,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.480]   because they got credit for something that they didn't do,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.960]   or you lash out because you didn't get credit
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.420]   because of something you did do.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.680]   And Jesus says something really profound,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.840]   and really necessary if you and I are gonna experience
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.680]   freedom from anger, which is knowing
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.220]   anytime that anger pops up, it's a heart issue.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.540]   It's underneath the surface.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.080]   There is a way to address it.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.320]   And if you do not address it,
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.160]   it, like any fire that seeps out,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.300]   will continue to burn and bring destruction
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.140]   to everything it touches.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.100]   And let me just say this.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.820]   In the room, all of us have certain levels of anger
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.420]   that are buried in our heart.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.580]   And all of us also express that anger in different ways.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.460]   Like, there's really at least two categories
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.300]   of people in the room.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.860]   There would be people, when it comes to getting angry,
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.420]   they would be what you would call an exploder.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.160]   This is the guy, gets upset, punches a hole in the wall.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.260]   We're very clearly like, yes, he has an anger problem.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.240]   Very easy to see.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.260]   This is the girl who, you know, gets upset,
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.400]   just goes on, you know, a rampage online,
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.560]   and she is keyboard caring,
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.480]   going to everybody's comments,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.080]   being like, I can't believe you.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.720]   It's clear, like, man, she's clearly angry.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.980]   So there's the exploder, and then there are the imploders.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.600]   This is a much more difficult to see perspective on anger,
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.160]   or expression of anger.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.120]   This is the person who doesn't explode outwardly.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.180]   They get hurt, and they just shut down.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.880]   They begin, you hurt them in a relationship,
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.100]   they totally withdraw.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.700]   This person ends up behaving passively aggressive
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.920]   towards you, or, you know, she's like,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.600]   you're friends, or you thought you were friends,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.000]   and you're like, well, why didn't you invite me to the party?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.140]   And she's like, oh, what?
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.700]   And she just behaves in a way.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.600]   Or she's passively aggressive, as in passive aggressive,
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.060]   meaning on the outside, it's passive.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.140]   But there's clearly anger and hurt that is taking place,
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.140]   and just as angry and hurt and seeping with bitterness
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.360]   can be that person.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.180]   Often, the imploder, if you are one, you deny your anger.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.300]   And somebody hurts you, and you don't even have time
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.740]   to totally process it all in the moment,
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.220]   and so they're like, hey, I'm sorry, did that hurt you?
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.780]   And you're like, no, no, everything's fine,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.860]   just please leave me alone for the rest of my life.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.860]   That's what you do.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.820]   But you harbor that anger, and you're gonna carry it around,
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.980]   and you may not last out of the person who hurt you,
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.780]   but you'll carry it around, and it will come out,
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.140]   even on people who have nothing to do with that hurt.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.800]   But the root of all of it is at the heart,
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.440]   and there is a way to address it.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.320]   Ultimately, the results of what happens
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.040]   from sinful anger are the same every single time.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.540]   Jesus says this in Matthew chapter five, verse 21.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.200]   This is in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.960]   Most famous sermon Jesus ever gave, just picture it.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.240]   They call it a mount, Sermon on the Mount,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.080]   because he taught it.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   In Matthew chapter five, verse one,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.020]   we're told from a mountainside.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.160]   Jesus is sitting there, early in his ministry,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.440]   very first message he ever gives,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.920]   thousands of people gathered around.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.460]   See it.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.460]   This Israeli 33 or 30-year-old rabbi shows up,
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.980]   and he begins to teach and blow everybody's category
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.500]   in the sermon, and this is one of the things that he says.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.320]   You've heard it said long ago, you shall not murder,
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.380]   and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:49.880]   But I tell you, anyone who is angry with a brother
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.900]   or a sister or a person will be subject to judgment.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.860]   That word subject to judgment is just out of step
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.300]   with God's command, has fallen short of what God commands.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.220]   In other words, Jesus is like,
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.780]   you guys put the line at murder.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.300]   As long as you don't murder, no anger problem.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.420]   Jesus says, no, that's not where God puts the line.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.340]   Anyone who holds anger in their heart
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.460]   is out of step with God.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.460]   Now, the word anger in this context, or being angry,
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.020]   is not the word like you had an angry thought,
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.060]   a one-off occasion.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.220]   It's a word to dwell on or focus on that anger,
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.040]   continue to replay it, not deal with it.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.940]   In other words, it's not an anger you feel in a moment,
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.700]   it's an anger you fuel or you feed over time.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.120]   You keep replaying, you keep replaying,
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.500]   and the more you replay it, the more you continue
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.000]   to not believe more and more the best about someone
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.380]   you believe the worst and worst and worst and worst
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.420]   and worst, and Jesus says, when you do that,
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.340]   you are just as guilty and just as off
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.060]   as the person who murders.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.420]   And then he says, verse 23,
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.020]   if you are offering a gift at the altar,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.700]   that'd be like if you're going to church,
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.420]   and you remember that your brother or sister
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.620]   has something against you, I want you to leave your gift
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.060]   at the altar, in the front of the altar.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.900]   You go there to church, raising,
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.560]   you turn graves into gardens, yes I will,
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.660]   and you realize, man, I think that Becky was hurt
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.160]   by the tone of that email or my text message
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.860]   or what I did.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.180]   He says, in the moment when you realize that,
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.860]   I want you to leave your gift at the altar
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.500]   and go and be reconciled in that relationship,
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.460]   then come back and offer your gift.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.380]   Why would you say that, Jesus?
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.900]   Because Jesus knew that the results of sinful anger
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.300]   every time are broken relationships.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.940]   Every time sinful anger takes place in the heart,
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.820]   every time you allow it and I allow it to exist
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.480]   in your hearts, the damage that's gonna take place
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.980]   is damage to you and damage to your relationships.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.780]   And I'm not even talking about like, oh, well,
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.020]   you know, Becky hurt me in that moment,
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.540]   so now I guess Becky and I are just gonna be off.
[00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.940]   You harbor that bitterness and it's gonna show itself
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.260]   back up in all kinds, every relationship.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.580]   There are lots more relationships than just that one.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.380]   Because the damage or the results of sinful anger
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.180]   in the heart are always broken relationships.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.900]   Jesus says something really profound.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.380]   I think about this.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.020]   I don't know, maybe you're here and a friend invited you
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.320]   and you're not even sure where you are in faith.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.840]   What Jesus just said to his audience,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.060]   how category-blowing was this?
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.960]   I want you to prioritize over giving any sort of sacrifice,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.060]   overcoming the church and worship,
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.240]   I want you to prioritize your horizontal relationships
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.980]   with other people above this one.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.340]   Like in other words, hey, we're not gonna be good
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.780]   if you continue to live not good with other people.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.860]   You continue to hide behind like, well, you know,
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.540]   they hurt me and they need to come apologize to me
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.660]   because really, you know, I may have not been the best
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.420]   in that moment, but if anybody is at fault, it's them,
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.300]   Jesus would say.
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:56.460]   You just recognize that you're off with someone
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.460]   and you should go seek that person out.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.860]   Because if you don't, broken relationship
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:03.740]   will take place there, it'll take place in your future,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   and in a way, it disconnects you from right relating to God.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.620]   Some of you were really hurt by your dad,
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:20.040]   and I love you, I see you, I love this group,
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.200]   I love this generation, I believe in this generation,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.680]   and as a bigger brother in life,
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.080]   I'm telling you, you've gotta forgive him.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.560]   Holding onto that is only gonna hurt you,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.480]   and you know what, if I knew your story
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.960]   and I knew what happened, I would be angry too.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:46.080]   You holding onto that, and that anger, it's not going away,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.520]   and it's gonna keep following you.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.520]   So as someone who has no skin in the game
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.480]   other than I care about each one of you,
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.800]   you have got to deal with that hurt.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.440]   Some of you have a past job,
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.380]   and you weren't treated right there.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.700]   And so one day, you just kinda like went MIA,
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.720]   and you were like, I'm gonna do ghosting to my work,
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.420]   and I'm just saying, I'm done, I'll leave the computer,
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.100]   and I'm not coming back anymore,
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.500]   'cause I've been updating my LinkedIn profile,
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.300]   and I got some leads, and I'm gonna run that direction,
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.900]   because you guys don't appreciate me,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.980]   and ain't nobody got time for that,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.880]   and you decided you were gonna let that hurt rule your life.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.460]   And you may need to call up your old boss,
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.020]   and say, hey, I didn't act like God would've had me,
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.360]   and the way that I responded to how I was feeling,
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   or the hurt that I experienced was wrong.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.780]   And you need to forgive and make the decision,
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.100]   and I'm gonna talk more in a second
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.220]   about what that looks like.
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.400]   Some of you are angry, understandably,
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.640]   you're just angry at men,
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.440]   because you were sexually abused,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.880]   and it wasn't your fault.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.120]   And that type of action angers the heart of God,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.600]   and it was wrong, it wasn't deserved,
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.320]   and it wasn't okay.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:13.040]   But you've gotta work through that hurt, and that anger,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.980]   and I hate that you feel that,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.320]   and it's really understandable you feel that.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.200]   But if you keep holding that, it is not going away,
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.360]   and God loves you.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.600]   He doesn't want you to go through life
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.340]   holding onto that pain and that anger,
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.800]   'cause it's not hurting them, it's hurting you,
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.380]   and will continue to hurt you.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.440]   I don't know what experience it is,
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.440]   maybe it's family, or a sibling, or a past roommate,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.200]   and you're really hurt, understandably really hurt,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.920]   a boyfriend who cheated on you.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.400]   But if you hold onto that bitterness,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:11.240]   it'll continue to grow, to add more experiences like it,
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.960]   and like a fire, will eventually make its way out,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.820]   and hurt any relationship that's in your life.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.500]   When I do counseling with couples,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.420]   when I do marriage counseling,
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.700]   or I agree to marry someone,
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.100]   I ask the same question, one of the questions I ask,
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.080]   I ask it every time.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.460]   And I ask both the groom to be, and the bride to be,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.340]   is there anyone in your life who you've not forgiven?
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.760]   Parent, past relations, is there anyone
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.020]   that you're harboring, holding to bitterness on?
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.180]   And if they say yes, so and so,
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.580]   I tell them I won't do the wedding,
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.400]   until they've worked through that,
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.540]   and it's not because I don't love them,
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.500]   it's not because I don't care about them,
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.780]   it's because I love them so much,
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.140]   I want them to make sure they enter into marriage,
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.340]   with the footing that I'm not going through life
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.460]   holding onto hurts, and bitterness, and anger, and grudges.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.020]   Because if you hold onto hurts before you get into marriage,
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.420]   you're gonna hold onto 'em when you get in there.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.260]   'Cause you're already used to it,
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.080]   it's just what I do.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.540]   When somebody really deeply hurts me,
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.860]   and almost always the case,
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:18.320]   the answer to that question if someone says yes,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.380]   I haven't forgiven this person,
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.220]   you know what it is?
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.740]   It's not that, oh, you know what?
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.240]   The grocery clerk at Trader Joe's was like,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.700]   oh, you can have one bag, and I was like,
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.420]   oh my gosh, and this is the person I'm angry,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.580]   it's never that person.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.700]   It's my dad.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.140]   It's my mom, she walked out.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.320]   It's my sister.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.260]   It's some like intimate relationship.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.940]   And I lovingly look, and I say,
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.860]   if you can't work through that, and forgive that person,
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.440]   you're not ready to marry him,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.100]   or you're not ready to marry her.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.560]   Because that intimate relationship
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.780]   that really hurt you, that's generally how it gets hurt,
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.580]   is it's like it's a father figure, it's a mother figure,
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.620]   it's a sibling, it's my own blood.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.980]   That's why the pain is so deep.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.460]   You will have the same experience with your husband,
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.700]   with your wife.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.020]   Listen to me very closely.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.600]   If you have not forgiven people,
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.860]   as lovingly as I can say it,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.000]   you are not ready to get married.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   85% of you, 80% of you, will get married by age 35.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.860]   So, everyone but y'all.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.420]   And, I'm totally kidding.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.000]   That's true.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.860]   Statistically speaking, that's true.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.520]   Statistically speaking, what else is true,
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.480]   is 50% of you will get divorced.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.320]   Why?
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.400]   Because people go through life,
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.400]   and they hold onto these hurts,
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.600]   and they feel justified in these hurts,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.720]   and I can't believe that he did that,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.760]   and no one ever says, you need to deal with that pain,
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.680]   you need to deal with that hurt.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.800]   Then they take it into marriage,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.880]   and then the most intimate human relationship
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.720]   you're gonna have.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.040]   Anyone know what that is?
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.580]   It's not your sister, it's your spouse.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.440]   The person who the most intimate relationship you have,
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.120]   and then they hurt you.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.840]   And, just how deeply intimate it is,
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.860]   also equates to how deeply painful it will be
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.000]   when they hurt you, and they will hurt you.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.880]   Sometimes intentionally, sometimes not intentionally,
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.280]   it's just a part of being married
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.880]   to another sinful human being.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:08.920]   So, if you haven't worked through,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.140]   and you're the person who, man, when I get hurt,
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.720]   I hold on, I hit the ejection button, I get out,
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.480]   you are not ready to get married.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.160]   Because when you move in that direction,
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.060]   marriage is one deep hurt after another,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.820]   and having to choose, I'm not holding onto this grudge.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.300]   What I mean, like, imagine with me.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.180]   I saw this illustration, a friend of mine shared it with me,
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.120]   and I was just like, man, it's such a great illustration.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.620]   Especially for this group as it relates to marriage.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.700]   And I know a lot of you are like, dude,
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.500]   I'm not even dating, and you're angry at me
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.380]   because we're talking about marriage.
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.220]   I know you're not.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.380]   I'm saying, before you even get there,
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.300]   you need to know, if you hold onto that hurt,
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.420]   you hold onto that roommate,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.380]   and I can't believe that he did that,
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.580]   and I don't talk to him anymore.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.860]   You're the type of person that is gonna hold onto hurt
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.380]   against your spouse.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.220]   'Cause you're gonna get in there,
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.960]   and you're gonna realize, it's great,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.360]   if you're dating and you're like,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.240]   not us, baby, we're together forever, it's amazing.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.320]   You're gonna realize,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.640]   there are gonna be times where they deeply hurt you.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.320]   And you're gonna find yourself going, I cannot believe that.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.680]   And all of a sudden, if you make,
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.920]   you're already making the practice that,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.660]   hey, I got hurt, I hold onto it.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.440]   You're gonna hold onto it, and the more that you do,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.760]   it's gonna wall off and separate you from that other person.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.600]   What do I mean?
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.560]   You're gonna get in a marriage,
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.040]   and all of a sudden, you're gonna be around
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.960]   that special someone girl, and you guys got married.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   Like, go there with me in your head.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.480]   You guys got married, it's beautiful.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.040]   You're probably not even dating, but just mentally,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.400]   put a faceless person next to you,
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.460]   and you're like, they look like everything
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.200]   I ever wanted in them, and this is so great,
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.480]   and they have the job that we want,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.400]   and we're married together.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.360]   Go there with me for a, it just happened.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.720]   You get married, things are going great,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.480]   honeymoon, everything's awesome.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.580]   Eventually, you're like, oh man,
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.980]   you brought in this relationship debt.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.280]   We gotta get rid of your debt,
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.260]   or we gotta get rid of my debt.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.360]   So we're getting on a budget, honey.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.520]   And then she's gonna show up, and she's gonna say,
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.480]   hey, great news, I know you're gonna be pumped for me.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.120]   There was a sale at Nordstrom's.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.960]   And so they had these shoes, and I was like,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.640]   oh my gosh, I can't believe that.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.420]   It would be like wrong to not buy these shoes,
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.440]   because I'm gonna need shoes eventually,
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.240]   and this is the most affordable I've ever seen them before,
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.340]   and you're gonna be like, we're on a budget, babe.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.780]   Why did you not follow the budget we agreed to
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.620]   that we set out on?
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.960]   You will like continue to do this.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.360]   And I'll tell you why, it's 'cause you're selfish.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.120]   You don't care about it, and you'll lash out,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.480]   and you'll hold onto that grudge,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.000]   and all of a sudden, that offense gets buried
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.040]   inside of your heart.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.880]   And you're gonna go, this is just who she is.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.240]   She doesn't care.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.560]   Same thing's gonna happen to girls.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.920]   You're gonna find yourself, your husband,
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.360]   all of a sudden, you had weekend plans.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.960]   And when you were dating, one of the things
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.080]   you loved about him was he was flexible,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.920]   he was just go lucky, he doesn't keep a calendar,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.600]   like he's not rigid, and I'm a little type A,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.160]   and so it really balances us out,
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.320]   and I just love that about him.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.640]   And then you get married, and you know what?
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.460]   You had a shower planned, a good friend of yours,
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.000]   maybe your bridesmaid, and you're wedding,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.360]   she's got a wedding shower coming up,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.960]   and you were supposed to go as a couple shower,
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.880]   you're gonna go together, and he double booked.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   'Cause remember, you married a guy who's not rigid,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.080]   doesn't keep a calendar, so he's a little flexible,
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.120]   and you're like, you don't even care about me.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.680]   You knew how important this was to me,
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.840]   and the thing that you were so like,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.400]   oh, I just love that about him, all of a sudden,
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.800]   you're like, you don't care.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.200]   Then, one night, you come home,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.420]   and one of you decides you're gonna initiate sex.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.960]   And the other person finds himself going,
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.160]   oh man, it's just been like a really stressful time,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.040]   or I'm just really tired right now,
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.640]   and I'm just kinda not in the mood.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   I know what you're thinking, you're like,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.480]   (laughs)
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.680]   no, we won't, I will always be in the mood.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.720]   I'm gonna marry someone with the same sex drive that I have,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.880]   we'll always be in the mood.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.720]   No, you won't.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.280]   And you're thinking right now, no, he's wrong,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.100]   we totally won't.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.280]   Nope, you're still wrong.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   Not gonna happen.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.000]   And you are gonna initiate sex,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.040]   and they are gonna say no.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.320]   And you are gonna feel offended,
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.960]   and you're gonna go, what, oh,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.000]   what, you just think I'm fat now?
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.920]   Is that what this is about?
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.800]   And you're gonna run there, and think,
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.600]   he doesn't care about me.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.240]   And all of a sudden, that offense continues to build,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.000]   and to build, and to build.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And then, we didn't even introduce the in-laws.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.120]   Okay?
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.480]   (audience laughs)
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.400]   And she's got a really close relationship with her mom,
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.840]   so she calls her mom all the time.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.000]   And when you were dating, you didn't even realize it,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.400]   'cause you didn't see her on the phone all the time,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.360]   'cause you didn't live together.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.680]   And she would just call her mom every night
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.620]   after she got done with the date,
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.960]   she's driving home, she's calling her mom,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.280]   you don't even know it, they're really close,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.200]   talks all the time.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.660]   Then you get married, you live together.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.780]   You see it all the time.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.760]   Sitting on the couch, you're like,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.820]   I thought we were gonna watch the show,
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.080]   and she's talking to her mom, giving the update.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.480]   And when she has trouble, she needs advice.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.320]   Who does she call?
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.520]   She calls her mom.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.360]   You had no idea.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.680]   And all of a sudden, you begin to think,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.820]   this woman doesn't even respect me.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.960]   She doesn't care about my opinion.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.280]   She just cares about her mom.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.160]   She cares about what she thinks way more
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.960]   than she does what I think.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.080]   And all of a sudden, bitterness after bitterness,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.520]   then you got holidays, and you were like,
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.680]   man, holidays are gonna be great, I can't wait.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.580]   Once you get to the fact that, hey,
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.580]   you now divide the carries on the holidays.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.640]   So you're like, oh, we're going to Christmas at your mom's
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.920]   or Christmas at my mom's?
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.680]   And she's like, well, I think we both know
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.800]   that your family's a little awkward,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.720]   and mine gives the best gifts,
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.440]   and so this feels like really easy.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.520]   Let's do Thanksgiving with yours.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.840]   And you're like, Thanksgiving?
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.880]   That's like the B-team version of holiday.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.780]   You don't care, you know my mom gave birth to me, right?
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.080]   And all of a sudden, what gets buried is anger,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.760]   bitterness, and hurt.
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.300]   And then, he ends up working late,
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.220]   and you had plans that night, and you're like,
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.640]   I told you we had dinner with the Smiths.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.320]   Do you not care about our family?
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.600]   And he's like, yes, what do you think I do at work all day?
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.820]   Just get a massage?
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.700]   I care about our family, I work really hard.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.920]   And both of you go, you don't care.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.200]   You don't care about our family, you don't care that I work.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.500]   And all of a sudden, step after step,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.560]   it just begins to grow.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.180]   And then, you introduce little ones.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.260]   Those are gonna be fun.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.700]   They got these little kids, they look like you.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.040]   It's little mini me, little girl,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.600]   princess dresses all the time, super fun.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.860]   They also don't sleep that great.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.160]   So one of you is gonna be what we call a light sleeper.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.460]   And what's gonna happen is they're gonna be the one
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.780]   who hears the children at night.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:51.940]   Typically, this is always the mom.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.140]   They've got some weird spidey sense.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.020]   But they end up waking up in the middle of the night,
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.440]   they hear the kids crying out there, like,
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.300]   and they wonder, why don't you care about our kids?
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.800]   I'm always the one getting up in kids,
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.040]   and I'd like a little help from time to time,
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.840]   because I'm up all hours of the night,
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840]   and you don't even care.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.760]   And I kicked you six times last night,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.640]   and you don't care about your children.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   And it continues to grow and grow.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.600]   And you know what's weird?
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.700]   Like, you get better over time as you do these things,
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.880]   and you begin to hold on.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.480]   And little things, that you're like,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.520]   how did that even become a thing?
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.100]   Becomes a thing.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.240]   What do I mean?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.680]   Eventually, after those little kids come,
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.400]   you're gonna be, sometimes,
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.880]   things happen with the body and hormones,
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.560]   and there I go.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.840]   And the wife will feel like,
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.800]   man, I just don't feel as pretty as I used to feel,
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.920]   and I can't work out nearly as much,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.520]   'cause I have these babies all around me all the time
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.880]   that are just little milk monsters,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.560]   and I feel like I'm just kinda gross.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.440]   And then you get this sale, and you get that dress,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.040]   and he was like, get that dress, and you get that dress,
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   and you get home, you go into a banquet for his work,
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.600]   and you put it on, and you're like, oh man,
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.240]   I just need some affirmation right now.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.640]   I just feel like, it's been kinda gross for a while,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.400]   and I just wanna look pretty and just be affirmed.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.000]   And you ask your husband, how do I look?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And he says, great.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.880]   Men.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.360]   She doesn't want you to say great.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.040]   She wants you to say, oh, wow!
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.640]   We are getting a babysitter, we are canceling the banquet,
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.680]   we're getting a hotel is what we're getting.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.200]   That's what she wants you to say.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.480]   But she doesn't hear that.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.880]   So all of a sudden, she runs to, great?
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.120]   I look great?
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.520]   He doesn't even love me.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.960]   And one by one by one,
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.120]   your relationship begins to get walled off.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.600]   And that offense after offense
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.120]   builds a fence between the two of you.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.720]   It happens, it's happening,
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.920]   it's why the divorce rate is what it is.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.660]   And if you can't learn to be the type of person
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.360]   that doesn't hold on and say, I'm keeping this,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.740]   you're not ready for marriage.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.600]   If you're in a place where you're seriously dating
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.440]   and moving in that direction
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.360]   and you haven't forgiven people in your life,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.320]   we'll talk about that in just a second,
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.780]   you are not ready to move in that direction.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.560]   And now is the time,
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.600]   whether you're single, dating, whatever you're at,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.500]   to begin to form the habit.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.700]   I don't hold onto these.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.960]   'Cause anytime I do, it's gonna keep showing up
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.600]   and keep breaking down relationships.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.880]   Jesus says it happens every time, but there is a solution.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.000]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 26 and 27 says this.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.300]   In your anger, do not sin.
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.800]   Do not let the sun go down while you're angry.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.000]   Do not give the devil a foothold.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.240]   Get rid, I want you to listen to this next verse.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.140]   The apostle Paul wrote this next verse
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.240]   from a Roman jail cell
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.640]   where law enforcement had wrongly arrested
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.180]   him for a crime he did not commit.
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.720]   He was waiting to be killed
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.600]   for the crime of being a Christian.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.100]   He went sitting, drinking a latte
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.360]   at some all-inclusive resort
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.520]   when he wrote what he was about to write.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.460]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.880]   And as he leaned back with scars on his back
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.400]   from being whipped against the jail cell,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.360]   he penned down the following words in 60 AD.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   "Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger."
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.720]   All bitterness, Paul?
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.560]   All of it.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.680]   "Brawling and slander, and every form of malice,"
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.320]   which is just ill will towards people.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.480]   How do I do that, Paul?
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.560]   "Be kind and compassionate to one another,
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:51.800]   "forgiving each other just as Christ, just as in Christ.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.680]   "God forgave you."
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.000]   The remedy for sinful anger is forgiveness.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.600]   And I'm making the decision to forgive.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.440]   Now, what does forgiveness mean?
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.720]   'Cause this is a word that's really churchy
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.120]   that most people are like, "Oh, yeah, I know what it means."
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:07.960]   And they don't.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.920]   Like, forgive and forget, that's right.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.480]   No, that's not right.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.520]   What does forgiveness mean, biblically?
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.280]   Everyone following me?
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.800]   It means I'm releasing in the face of hurt,
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.000]   in the face of harm taking place against me,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.160]   in the face of whatever has made me anger, angry, and bitter.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:32.000]   I'm choosing to release my demand for justice
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.840]   or for payback to God.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.560]   I'm choosing, "Hey, you cheated on me,
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.400]   "and I'm really angry,
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.220]   "and I want you to suffer because of that."
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.160]   I'm choosing to forgive you by releasing
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:49.760]   the demand that's in my heart for justice to God.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.120]   Forgiveness is not excusing sin.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.480]   It's not saying, "Oh, it's not that big of a deal."
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.620]   No, sin is a huge deal.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.680]   It's such a big deal, Jesus had to die for it.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.760]   Forgiveness does not require forgetting.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.700]   In fact, I don't even know that you can fully forgive
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.800]   someone if you just forget.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.600]   That'd be awesome if men in black could just show up
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.920]   and be like, "Hey, you never remember this again."
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.120]   No, real forgiveness shows itself in that you did that,
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.020]   and I forgive you.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.920]   I'm not holding you accountable for paying back
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.400]   for what you owe me, for what you took,
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.240]   for how you hurt me.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.360]   It's releasing that to God.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.080]   I'm trusting God with justice.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:31.200]   Forgiveness is not denying your hurt or your anger,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.240]   and forgiveness is not conditional.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.180]   It does not require the person to ask for forgiveness
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.400]   or to own their part or even be present.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.200]   It's releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.120]   The Bible just said, "How do we forgive?"
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.080]   And Paul said, "You forgive like God forgave you
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.840]   "when you didn't deserve it, still don't deserve it,
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.840]   "haven't earned it, but in Christ, he forgave you.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.900]   "He paid for all of that debt, for every hurt,
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.620]   "for every wrong, for every justice that will
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:12.060]   "and must take place, and we forgive just like God forgave."
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.040]   In Matthew chapter 18, let me tell a really quick story.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.840]   We're not far from landing the plane.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.480]   Matthew chapter 18, the disciples come up to Jesus,
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.120]   and this was all throughout Jesus' teachings.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.160]   I mean, it's pretty crazy.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.160]   You read over and over, like he was really passionate
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.440]   about, "I love relationships, and if you hold onto anger,
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.700]   "you're not gonna have good relationships.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.600]   "You've gotta forgive."
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.320]   And so Jesus had these guys, the disciples,
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.520]   that heard him talk about this a lot,
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.260]   and they come up to him, and Peter is like,
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.520]   "Hey, guys, I got a question for Jesus.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.360]   "I got an answer.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.760]   "I'm really proud of my answer.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.840]   "Can't wait to see what happens."
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   Goes up to Jesus, "Jesus, how many times
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.940]   "do I forgive my brother?"
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.200]   Now, in Jesus' time, there were a few schools of thought,
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.260]   or there were these philosophy rabbis, basically,
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.180]   that had these camps of like,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.700]   "Hey, this is the number you forgive.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.460]   "Up to three times, if they do that action,
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.300]   "you forgive them."
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.620]   Other people would be like, "No, you forgive them once.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.800]   "If they do it again, they do it once,
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   "shame on me if they do it."
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.400]   No, however that expression goes,
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.040]   if they do it twice, shame on me.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.400]   Once, shame on them, whatever that is.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.760]   There were these different schools of thought.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.320]   Peter comes up, he says, "How many times should I forgive?"
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   And then he throws out what he was like a zinger.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.300]   "Up to seven times?"
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.060]   And the reason I say he would have been proud of it
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:21.140]   is because there's no rabbis that were teaching that.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.760]   So he's going, "Hey, look how generous I am.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.740]   "Up to seven, huh?
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.580]   "How about that?
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.860]   "Look how great I am."
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.600]   And Jesus says, "Not seven times, Peter.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.020]   "70 times seven."
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.780]   In other words, you never stop forgiving.
[00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   And jaw drops happen all around Jesus.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.900]   We go, "What?
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.260]   "Over and over and over?"
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.840]   Over and over and over.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.460]   Is that how God has forgiven you?
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.300]   And then he tells this parable,
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.260]   and it's a beautiful parable,
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.180]   and we don't have time to read it right now,
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.140]   but here's the summary of the parable.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.460]   Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven is like this.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.900]   "There was a guy who had a $6 billion debt."
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.740]   Literally, if you take the number
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.820]   that Jesus equated, $6 billion.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.860]   This dude had hit Vegas way too many times.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   Something had happened, he got in debt to another guy,
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.280]   $6 billion, and the guy says,
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.600]   "Hey, you're way overdue on your debt,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.440]   "and you gotta pay your debt."
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.220]   And the guy says, "I can't pay it, $6 billion."
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.800]   He says, "All right, take him, take everything he owns,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.260]   "take his family, and sell 'em,
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.920]   "and we'll take the products that are over there,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.780]   "or we'll take whatever we make off of that person."
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.620]   And the servant, we're told, was in debt.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:22.860]   He throws himself to his knees.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.940]   He begins to say, "Jesus, Jesus."
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.260]   He begins to say to the person in the story,
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   "I'll pay it back.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.280]   "Please, give me enough time.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.820]   "Please, show me mercy."
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.420]   And those listening would have known,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.960]   you can't pay $6 billion back.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.140]   This was a debt way too great.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.300]   But the servant's begging, "Please, give me mercy.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.180]   "Please, I'll pay it back."
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.100]   And we're told, the person he was in debt to
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.180]   showed him mercy and said, "I will forgive the debt."
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.980]   The guy gets up, he goes home, he's really excited.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.740]   He's gonna go tell his wife, "We were in six,
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.580]   "that's a good day.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.560]   "You get $6 billion out of debt?
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.460]   "That's an exciting day.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.780]   "We're going out for champagne or sparkling grape juice
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.020]   "or whatever you feel okay about."
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:07.000]   And he goes, and on the way home,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.440]   he bumps into a guy who owes him 1,000 bucks.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.980]   And he grabs the guy and he says, "Where's my 1,000 bucks?"
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.820]   Jesus is telling the story, so brilliant.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:17.820]   He's a great storyteller.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.100]   He's telling his audience.
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.220]   On his way home, he bumps into the guy
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.140]   that owed him 1,000 bucks.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.140]   He begins to shake him and say, "Give me my $1,000."
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.980]   And that guy says, "Please, give me time.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.140]   "I'll pay it back, I'll pay it back, I'll pay it back."
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:27.980]   And he says, "No."
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.620]   And he throws and sells his family
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.700]   and does what was supposed to happen to him.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.260]   And we're told that the original guy,
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.780]   the $6 billion guy who forgave the loan,
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.600]   finds out about it.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.720]   And he comes and he says, "You wicked servant.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.940]   "I forgave you a million times more of what you owed,
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.240]   "what you can never pay back.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.860]   "And this guy actually could pay back what you owed him.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.500]   "And yet you didn't show mercy to him.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   "You think I'm gonna show mercy to you?"
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.120]   And then Jesus says this line.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.100]   "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you.
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:08.400]   "Unless you forgive your brother or sister from the heart."
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.940]   Wait a second, are you saying that,
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.640]   like if I'm a Christian, but I don't forgive somebody,
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.860]   that you're gonna throw me in some jail?
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.620]   And Jesus is saying, "If you're a Christian,
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.820]   "you forgive people.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.620]   "Because you've been forgiven of a debt
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.400]   "way bigger than whatever they did to you."
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.960]   And I know that's crazy, because the pain in this room,
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.380]   I've been doing this 13 years.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:42.280]   The stories that I've heard of horrific things
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.260]   that have happened are that, they're horrific.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.220]   And Jesus would say, "No matter what the pain was,
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.660]   "and it wasn't right, and it wasn't deserved,
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.660]   "and it wasn't fair, and it wasn't okay,
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:58.000]   "but it pales in comparison to what you and I have done
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.040]   "in sinning against God, and you must forgive
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.480]   "and choose to forgive."
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.220]   What does it look like to forgive?
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.420]   It looks like canceling the debt,
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.140]   and let me be really clear, I'm gonna move quick,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.580]   and I wanna, best I can, help practically walk through
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.820]   what that looks like, I think, in your life.
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.940]   Inside of the parable, Jesus says forgiveness
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.540]   is canceling a debt that's owed.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.140]   It's like, "Hey, you don't owe me anymore,
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.000]   "and I wanna encourage you to do something
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.660]   "that was really helpful for me."
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.620]   There was a moment I sat down in my life
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.060]   where I realized I was carrying a lot of hurt
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.620]   from my father, who was absent.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.500]   Wasn't present, and I began to process through that pain
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.380]   and through just the counsel of scriptures like these
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.220]   and other believers in my life, going,
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.600]   "In order to cancel a debt, it's really hard
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.980]   "to cancel a debt if you don't know how much the debt is,
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.380]   "if you don't know what the debt is."
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.820]   And I began to go like, "Man, identifying,
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.640]   "what did he take from you, what was taken from you?"
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.100]   'Cause if I'm gonna cancel that,
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.580]   this blanket statement ends up happening
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.500]   for a lot of Christians, they're like,
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.580]   "Yes, I forgive, I feel good today, and I forgive,"
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.820]   and then it pops back up.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.100]   In order to really forgive, you gotta decide,
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.840]   "Hey, I'm not holding this against you anymore.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.500]   "I'm canceling what I feel like you owe me
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   "because God has already canceled all that I owe him,
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.420]   "every way that I've sinned against him."
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.620]   And I sat down, and you know what I began to do,
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.180]   I began to write out very specifically,
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.620]   maybe this will be helpful to you,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.620]   you took from me having a father around.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.780]   You took from me a dad who came to my sport games
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.820]   in college, in high school.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.180]   You took from me, Monday nights,
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.620]   I had to drive across town to that terrible apartment.
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.620]   And I didn't want to, and I didn't have a choice,
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.020]   'cause custody do orders.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:52.460]   You took from me having an example in my life
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.740]   of what it looks like to love a wife.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:46:02.880]   And I'm deciding, you don't owe me anymore.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.600]   (sighing)
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.880]   You never owe me.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:14.560]   Every sin that we commit is ultimately a sin against God,
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.480]   and I'm not holding onto that anymore.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.240]   And that's between you and God.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.880]   Every sin that you've done will be paid for on the cross,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.400]   just like every sin I've done was paid for on the cross.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.020]   I'm not carrying that anymore.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.440]   Some of you, you've got to do this.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   And my heart breaks because I know
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.280]   he took from you your virginity.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.300]   He took from you.
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:49.400]   Having a mother around her, she took from you.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.560]   He took from you the shame that you carry every day
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.920]   from abortion that you didn't want to get,
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.620]   and he told you you needed to get.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.000]   You've got to let it go.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.500]   Holding onto it will only hurt you.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.360]   And one of the most healthy things you can do
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.620]   is to sit down and write out,
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.380]   this is what was taken from me.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:20.160]   This is what I experienced, and it wasn't right.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.600]   And I'm not saying it was right by forgiving it,
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.660]   but I'm not gonna live my life allowing my past experiences
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.520]   and past hurts and people that hurt me so deeply
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.160]   to rule my life, to rule my future marriage,
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   to determine the type of person I'm gonna be.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.460]   I'm not doing that anymore.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.680]   I'm not putting whether or not I'm gonna have
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.960]   a healthy relationship with my future husband
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.960]   in the hands of somebody who did horrific things against me.
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:47.880]   I'm not giving you that power, and it won't be easy,
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.080]   and it's really hard.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.060]   But God promises when we do,
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.880]   not only do we look more like Jesus,
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   we experience freedom because holding onto that bitterness,
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.160]   it's only gonna hurt you.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.720]   And as you head into life, all of us have sinned
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.160]   against a perfect God.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:13.880]   And what we do as Christians, and this is why I say
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.340]   there is no remedy that I know of
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.640]   outside of what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:24.560]   Where the way that we deal with sin
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.800]   that happened against us and terrible, painful things
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:32.840]   that happened against you is not by pretending they didn't.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.320]   It doesn't work.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.280]   It never will work.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.560]   It's by making the decision.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:43.280]   What you did was terrible.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.620]   It hurt me, it deeply.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:48.720]   I've carried that pain for years,
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.960]   and it's making the decision.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.320]   I'm not gonna carry it anymore
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.600]   because I'm bringing like every hurt
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.360]   I've ever had in life
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:06.640]   into the God who was unjustly,
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:12.320]   unfairly killed, crucified,
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.240]   and had his life taken
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   for every father in this room who failed their kids,
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:26.860]   for every sexual abuser, every racist police officer,
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:34.520]   every atrocious act, all of them were paid for.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.480]   And this is the only way to experience freedom,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.840]   is to accept, God, I'm a way bigger sinner.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:45.880]   I've done way worse things than what I am asking
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.520]   or what I'm holding other people,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   or I've done equally as terrible things.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.400]   The forgiveness that you have extended me
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.600]   is far greater than any forgiveness
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.840]   I'll ever be able to give them, and I am accepting.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.920]   You paid for it on the cross.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.080]   Every horrific action will be paid for
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.120]   and was paid for on the cross,
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:06.320]   will be paid for by that person for all of eternity.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.640]   Every injustice will be made right,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   even the ones not caught on camera.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.280]   And I'm not gonna hold onto that bitterness anymore.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.440]   I'm not carrying that for the rest of my life.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.400]   And I love you guys.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.240]   I love you.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.080]   I love you.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:22.020]   And I don't want that for you.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.560]   But I don't have a decision
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.800]   over whether you're gonna release that,
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.640]   whether you're gonna decide,
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.200]   I'm not carrying this any longer.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.120]   I'm not gonna define my future,
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.360]   but what happened in the past,
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.200]   what happened against me in the past,
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.400]   it's not a decision I get to make, that's one you have to.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.880]   As you walk through that, if we can serve and care for
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.560]   and come alongside, we'd love to.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.200]   God has extended to all people.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.220]   You bring those and you drop them.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.300]   They have been paid for.
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.760]   You don't have to hold those.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.800]   You release them to me.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.760]   You release them to me.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.240]   Let me pray.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:07.120]   Father, thank you for the fact that
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.640]   when we didn't deserve it, we don't deserve it,
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.880]   you extended a forgiveness
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.480]   to a debt we could never repay.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:22.440]   Candidly, in life, it feels
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.620]   like what you ask us to do sometimes is not possible.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.560]   And so I pray that you would help
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.840]   hundreds of us in the room
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.400]   who've experienced hurt at levels
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.120]   we can't even really put into words.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   I pray for the hundreds in here
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:40.960]   who've been sexually abused or raped.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.700]   I pray for those who were molested by a family member,
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.660]   their parents divorced, their parents was alcoholic,
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:53.200]   they abused them, they were robbed,
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.260]   they were unjustly treated by coworkers.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:01.780]   You would help us, God,
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.500]   to have the strength to do what feels impossible,
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.020]   but you went well beyond
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:10.900]   in the lengths you went to forgive us.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.300]   And you gave us your spirit.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.660]   And so would you by your spirit help us,
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:19.540]   strengthen us, and move us,
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.820]   will we be free, forgiven?
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.860]   Worship you in song, amen.
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:35.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
