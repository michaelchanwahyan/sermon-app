[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [music]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.020]   [music]
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.020]   [cheers]
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.020]   >> PORCH, how we doing?
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.020]   Hey, hey.
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.020]   So amazing just to be with you guys.
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.020]   PORCH Live locations, Boise, Scottsdale, Indianapolis, Fort
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.020]   Worth, all over the place.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.020]   God is moving on the move through the lives of young
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.020]   adults.
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.020]   If we haven't met, my name is JP, Jonathan Bercuda.
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020]   It's a privilege to serve with you tonight.
[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.020]   I spent a lot of time in this place and just have a really
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.020]   special place in my heart.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020]   Josiah said today, hey, welcome home.
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.020]   And I feel that.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.020]   I feel like I'm visiting home.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.020]   I'm going to start by sharing a prayer that Sam sent me today.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020]   He said, JP, I'm praying for tonight.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020]   I sense the spirit giving me a prayer to pray that I'm excited
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.020]   about.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.020]   I'm praying that pastors would be born tonight.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.020]   That there would be someone sitting up top in the back hung
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.020]   over and in shame for the decisions he or she has made in
[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.020]   life.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020]   But who could be set free tonight and become a mouthpiece
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.020]   for God.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.020]   I'm asking that your kind would be multiplied not for your glory
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.020]   but for God's and for the good of his kingdom.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.020]   May you rightly handle the word of truth and God, use your
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.020]   faithfulness to set apart new vessels as holy and ready for
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.020]   the master's work.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.020]   And I just responded, what a perfect prayer.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.020]   And that's what excites me about these moments right here.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.020]   Because there's some of you here for the wrong reasons.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.020]   There's some of you here on a dare.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020]   There's some of you, you know, a friend said, hey, come with me
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.020]   to the porch.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.020]   And you're like, oh, the restaurant or the bar.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.020]   And then they turn into a church.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.020]   You're like, wait, what are we doing here?
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020]   And I'm glad you're here, man.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.020]   I was you.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.020]   That's the reality.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020]   That's the truth.
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.020]   I was you.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.020]   And so, Lord, I do just pray you do a work.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.020]   Open our hearts for whatever it is that you want to do.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.020]   I pray that you would keep us safe, that you would remove any
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.020]   and all distractions from our lives and that you would just
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.020]   bring us to a place where we see your word front and center and
[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.020]   that it's sharper than a two-edged sword, that it would
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.020]   penetrate both bone and marrow in our hearts and change us from
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.020]   the inside out.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.020]   In the name of Jesus, amen.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.020]   Hey, everybody has special, like, different gifts.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.020]   You know, I don't know what your gifts are.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.020]   Some of you can run fast.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.020]   You're good at math.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.020]   You know, everyone is dealt gifts.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020]   A gift as God was distributing them that I did not receive was
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.020]   a good sense of direction, okay?
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.020]   Like, I get lost in my neighborhood.
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.020]   I'm like, wait, hold on.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.020]   You know, I'm like driving in circles.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.020]   Have I seen that house?
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.020]   Somebody is like, that's your house.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.020]   Oh, it's my house.
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.020]   Like, I get -- I'm just not -- I truly, like, I'll pull into a
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.020]   neighborhood.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.020]   I don't know how to get out.
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.020]   Somebody is like, hey, which way is north?
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.020]   I'm like, I have no idea.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.020]   I'm an early adopter of the GPS navigation system.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.020]   Like, I got in that game early.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.020]   You know, I don't go anywhere without putting it, you know, in
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.020]   Google Maps or Waze or if I don't want to get there, Apple
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.020]   Maps.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.020]   And so, like, I'm big on the GPS.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.020]   And recently I got a new car.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   Or it's a used car but new to me car, right?
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   And so, like, when I'm purchasing a car, if I'm
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.020]   choosing, like, I put a navigation system high on the
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.020]   priority list.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.020]   And so it has that.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.020]   And I'm coming back, I'm flying back to DFW from Atlanta.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020]   And I don't know if you know this about our story but four
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.020]   years ago our family moved from this place, from this church and
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   this ministry to Waco to be a part of a church there and
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.020]   continue God's mission in Waco.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:27.020]   So I fly in from Atlanta to DFW and the new used car has one of
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.020]   these cool features where you can just hit home.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.020]   Like, you can just push the home button and it tells you how to
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.020]   get there.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.020]   And so I, like, pull, I'm ready to get home.
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.020]   I miss my kids.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.020]   I miss my wife.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.020]   I went by myself.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.020]   I push the home button and DFW is, like, the most confusing
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.020]   place in the world.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.020]   Like, north terminal, south terminal, I'm like, whatever.
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.020]   So I just do what it says.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   And all of a sudden, so it takes me out of, you know, DFW south
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.020]   exit but then it has me turn left toward Dallas which I've
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.020]   never done before.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.020]   Like, usually you go kind of through Fort Worth to get to
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.020]   Waco from DFW.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020]   So I turn left.
[00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.020]   I'm like, this is weird but, like, maybe it senses traffic
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.020]   because it's smart like that.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.020]   Like, it knows if there's some traffic.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.020]   It knows somehow.
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.020]   I don't know how.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.020]   But black magic.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.020]   But somehow it knows.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.020]   And so I'm like, all right.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.020]   So I go left.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.020]   I'm driving to Dallas.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.020]   Oh, it's going to take me to Dallas, you know.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.020]   But then it takes me all the way to Dallas.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.020]   Then it takes me through Dallas.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.020]   And I'm, like, moving toward Mesquite, you know, and whatnot.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.020]   I'm like, this is a really weird way to get to Waco, you know.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.020]   And then it has me turn north.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.020]   And I'm like, wait a minute.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   You know, I know I'm not good at this, but I'm pretty sure Waco's south.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.020]   And so I pull over.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   I just pull over on the side of the road.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.020]   I'm trying to figure out what's going on.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.020]   Well, somehow the navigation system in the car had reverted back to the
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.020]   original owner's address.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.020]   Yeah, like reset or something at night.
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.020]   And so it was taking me to his house, which he evidently lives north of Dallas.
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.020]   And I tell you that, but because before I can follow that, before I can, you know,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.020]   do what it tells me to do, to go where it tells me to go, I have to make sure that
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.020]   I input the right destination.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.020]   And your heart works the same way.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.020]   Your heart works the same way.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.020]   Some of you have given advice to friends, well, just listen to your heart.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.020]   You've asked questions, well, what is your heart telling you to do?
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.020]   You're like this, Selena Gomez, you know, the heart wants what it wants.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.020]   No, the heart wants what it's fed.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.020]   Before you can follow your heart, you have to make sure that it is set on the
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.020]   right destination.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.020]   I just finished a literary work.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.020]   It is actually released today.
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.020]   And it asked the question in the title, why do I do what I don't want to do?
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.020]   And I want to answer the question so you don't even need to buy it.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.020]   I'm just going to give you the punchline because you have sin hidden in your heart.
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.020]   That's why you do what you don't want to do.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.020]   And the scripture doesn't say to follow your heart.
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.020]   It actually says to guard your heart.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.020]   And if you've been in church long, you probably have heard someone like me
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.020]   stand on a stage like this and say, guard your heart.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.020]   You know, it's like the 15-year-old lock-in.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.020]   Maybe you grew up in church and there was the overnight and there's some
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.020]   pastor saying, guard your heart.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.020]   And every 15-year-old girl is like, yes, I'm going to, but what does it mean?
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.020]   And so I'm going to tell you because the scripture tells us exactly what it means.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.020]   And the verse isn't written for a 15-year-old girl at a lock-in.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:03.020]   It's written for all of us who want more from our faith.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:07.020]   Maybe you sit down at a quiet time and it feels like a punishment.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.020]   Maybe you're trying to pray but you're distracted.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.020]   Maybe you read the Bible and it doesn't make sense.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.020]   Maybe like a dog to his vomit, you keep going back to the same things that seek
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.020]   to take you out.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.020]   And I'm telling you, there is a solution.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.020]   And if you lean in and as we open the word and we see what it says, I think you
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.020]   might find something in it that will actually set you free.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.020]   That there is a way that you can leave here tonight and actually guard your
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:41.020]   heart in a way consistent with what the scriptures call you to.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.020]   Even the Bible can be confusing on the issue because if you've been in church
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.020]   long, you probably have thought about Jeremiah 17, 9.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.020]   By now, the heart is wicked and deceitful and beyond cure.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.020]   Who can trust it?
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.020]   Who can know it?
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.020]   Maybe you know that verse.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.020]   But that's half the story because there's also Romans 5.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.020]   "But thanks be to God that though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.020]   obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.020]   allegiance."
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:17.020]   So I asked a theologian friend, "Is the regenerate heart trustworthy?"
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.020]   The regenerate heart is just a theological term for the new heart,
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.020]   the spirit-filled heart.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:34.020]   And they said, "Yes, but the degenerate heart, the fallen heart, the flesh, is
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   never dead as long as we're on this earth."
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.020]   So you always have this sin nature at war with God's desires for you and that's
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.020]   why Paul says, "The good I want to do, I don't do, but the evil I don't want to
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.020]   do, this I keep on doing."
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.020]   Then I know you've been there.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   I don't want to click that hashtag.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.020]   I don't want to go back to that porn site.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   I don't want to call that boyfriend that knows no good for me.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   I don't want to drink too much and I don't want to hang with them and I don't
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:08.020]   want to watch that show again, but I keep finding myself in this place where I'm
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:14.020]   doing the things I don't want to do.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.020]   What does it mean to guard our heart?
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.020]   Read Proverbs chapter 4 if you'll turn there with me.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:27.020]   It's right in the middle of the Scripture in the Old Testament.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.020]   It's the book of Proverbs.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.020]   Move toward the center of your Bible.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.020]   The first nine chapters of Proverbs is really made up of 10 lectures and it's
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:44.020]   really a father speaking to his son, mostly written by King Solomon.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.020]   Certainly this part is.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.020]   He's known as the wisest man who has ever lived other than Jesus.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.020]   He penned these words thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago so
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.020]   that we can open this book called the book of wisdom and apply it to our lives
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.020]   tonight and still in 2023 glean wisdom from it.
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:05.020]   It's actually pretty amazing.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.020]   I'll read the whole thing and then we'll kind of break it down and figure out
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:15.020]   how to guard our heart.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.020]   My son, pay attention to what I say.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.020]   Turn your ear to my words.
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.020]   He's like, hey, may I have your attention.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.020]   That worked really well, man.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.020]   You guys were ready for the clap.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.020]   Oh, wait, hold on.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.020]   Do not let them out of your sight.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.020]   Keep them within your heart.
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.020]   He's about to say, he's about to warn us about what we let in our heart but he
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.020]   says, hey, this is what I'm about to tell you.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.020]   I want you to open your heart to this.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.020]   Make sure you let this in your heart.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   For they are life to those who find them and health to one's whole body.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.020]   The stakes are high.
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.020]   It's life and death.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.020]   We talk a lot about mental health right now.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.020]   You want mental health.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   He's like, I'm going to tell you a way that you can have or find or keep good
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.020]   mental health.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:08.020]   Above all else, guard your heart for everything you do flows from it.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.020]   Your version might say, keep your heart with all diligence.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:18.020]   The word keep there is like the milk keeps, like keep the food from spoiling.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.020]   He's saying, hey, your heart, it can turn rotten.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   Anybody know anyone with a rotten heart?
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   Anybody ever dated somebody with a rotten -- don't point.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.020]   Don't elbow.
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.020]   Not the time for that.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:35.020]   But, yeah, your heart, it can spoil.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.020]   Keep your mouth free from perversity.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.020]   He's telling us how.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.020]   Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.020]   Let your eyes look straight ahead.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.020]   Fix your gaze directly before you.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.020]   Give careful thought to the past before your feet and be steadfast in all your
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.020]   ways.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.020]   Do not turn to the right or the left.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.020]   Keep your foot from evil.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.020]   Three key observations from this text.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.020]   Number one, your heart stores information.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.020]   It's like a storage container.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.020]   You put stuff there.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.020]   Number two, the stuff that you put in your heart determines where you go.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.020]   Everything from your life flows from it.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.020]   And number three, he calls you to guard it more than you guard anything, which I
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.020]   don't want you to sleep on that.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.020]   Like, that's important instruction.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:29.020]   And so, the first question is, what does it mean to guard your heart?
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.020]   What does it mean to guard your heart?
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.020]   It means to be very careful what you let in.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.020]   It's a military term, actually.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:44.020]   Like a soldier, like an armed guard who, when someone tries to breach the castle
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:51.020]   with violence and hostility, he takes them down.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:56.020]   Above all else, more than you guard your stereo, more than you guard your
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.020]   apartment, more than you guard your house, more than you guard your money with
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:07.020]   FDIC insurance or whatever it is you put it in a bank and in a vault, more than
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:14.020]   you guard your emails or your computers, password protections.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.020]   When you guard anything, guard your heart.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.020]   For everything you do flows from it.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:27.020]   It's going to determine what comes out of your life.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.020]   But how do we guard our heart?
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.020]   How do we do it?
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   You take in things through your five senses.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.020]   You guys remember this from health class?
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.020]   See, hear, smell, taste, touch.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.020]   You take in things.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.020]   This represents your five senses.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.020]   So, as you experience things, it takes what you're experiencing out here into
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.020]   your brain, into your mind.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.020]   Because as we talk about the heart, I want you to know we're not talking about
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.020]   the physical organ.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.020]   We're not talking about the thing beating in your chest.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.020]   In the scripture where you see the heart, it's like the word we say, the gut,
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.020]   your spirit.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.020]   Like the thing inside you where you keep stuff.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.020]   And there's a difference between your mind and your heart.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.020]   Your mind is what you think.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.020]   Your heart is what you feel.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.020]   Your mind is what you think.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.020]   Your heart is what you feel.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:24.020]   So, as you take in things from your five senses, right, they go into your mind.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.020]   You store them in your mind.
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.020]   And you know this.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.020]   Like you, "Oh, man, my mom."
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.020]   You have that nostalgia, that familiarity.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.020]   "Oh, man, my mom used to make this lasagna.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.020]   Oh, I smell this place.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.020]   I remember going here when I was a kid.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   Oh, I danced to this in eighth grade.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.020]   Call me, maybe."
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.020]   You know, it's like -- and it's like all of a sudden I'm back there,
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.020]   and all the insecurities are flooding.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.020]   Baby, bye-bye, bye."
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.020]   Whatever it is, right, you hear it, and it just takes just like a time warp,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:56.020]   back in time, because you experience it out here, and it comes in here.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.020]   And your brain, your brain then feeds your heart.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.020]   And it takes those things that you think, and it stores them
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.020]   where you keep your emotions in your heart.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.020]   And then what you put in your heart determines where you go.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:16.020]   Everything in your life flows from it.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.020]   Okay?
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:26.020]   I was driving here, and I was stressed.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.020]   I'm like, "Why am I stressed?"
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.020]   You know, I had a rushed, quiet time this morning.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.020]   We had staff prayer.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.020]   You know, I'm pounding coffee.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.020]   Book release is today, and so like I'm watching it on Amazon.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.020]   I want to know how it's doing, you know?
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.020]   And if I'm like in full transfer, I'm watching it too much.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:51.020]   I'm filling my head too much with -- I'm trying to find significance in a ranking.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.020]   You know?
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.020]   And then that feeds my heart.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.020]   And then when I begin to find identity in how I'm doing,
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:03.020]   you can understand how many friends you have, if you have a significant other or not,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.020]   your relationship status, how you're doing at work.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.020]   If you ever checked -- I don't know if you've ever checked your bank account,
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.020]   but you're like, "Oh, okay, it's still there," you know, or you're just trying to --
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:15.020]   it's a bit irrelevant today -- just trying to understand like, "Hey, do I have --"
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.020]   I don't know if you -- you probably don't struggle with that,
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.020]   but you're just trying to say, "What is my safety blanket?
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.020]   What can I grab control over?"
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:29.020]   And the Scripture says that you're -- have you ever been to a club where there's like a bouncer, you know,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.020]   and he's like choosing -- you ever been to one of these places, you know,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:36.020]   where they're like choosing who they let -- like, "Hey, you -- no, with the flip-flops, you can't come in, no.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.020]   But you, oh, yeah, with the cute bag, come on, you know, come to the front."
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.020]   You ever seen this? You guys ever seen this?
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:46.020]   You guys are like, "I'm in church." "No, I've never -- I don't know what you're talking about, pastor."
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:52.020]   "Oh, okay, well, there are these things called clubs, and they have people called bouncers,
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:18:00.020]   and this Scripture is saying, 'Hey, you got to be the bouncer of what you let in your heart.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   You got to check IDs, man, okay?
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   You got to make sure that it is of God, because if it's not of God,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.020]   it's not going to take you to godly places.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.020]   You just think it's that simple."
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   And you're like, "Well, that's too simple."
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:25.020]   No, it's that simple. It's real. It's true.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   And you can not just let -- keep bad things out, you can let good things in.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.020]   Up until about 10 to 20 years ago, if you went to a therapist, and you said,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:42.020]   "Mr. Therapist, I am really struggling with some severe anxiety," right?
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.020]   That therapist is going to prescribe for you, if they can,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.020]   or they're going to send you to a doctor so that you can leave with what's called an SSRI,
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.020]   a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:56.020]   Okay, this is medication. Some of you know this. Some of you are on it. You've been on it.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.020]   Nothing wrong with medication. That's not what I'm saying.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:04.020]   And in fact, sometimes it's really necessary so that you can actually get to a place where you can apply therapy.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.020]   But today, you go to a therapist, and you say, "I'm really struggling with anxiety,"
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:14.020]   more than likely, even if they are an atheist scientist doctor,
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:21.020]   you're going to leave with an assignment that looks something like prayer.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   It's called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:31.020]   And they're going to say, "Hey, I want you to start every day in deep contemplative thought.
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.020]   I want you to sit still. I want you to meditate."
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.020]   And it's like our science is catching up with the Bible, where David says,
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.020]   "I meditate on your law day and night. Set your mind on the things above.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.020]   Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:53.020]   Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable,
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.020]   if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about these things.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.020]   These are thousands of year old texts that our science is all of a sudden saying,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.020]   "Hey, there's something on to this stuff."
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:11.020]   It actually helps people.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   But how do we guard our heart?
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.020]   Let me give you five questions.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.020]   Who, what, where, when, why?
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   They're who, what, where, when, why questions.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.020]   This is a note taker sermon from here.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.020]   You're going to want to get a pen or your phone or something, throw it on airplane mode.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   You're probably going to want to take notes here because it's going to feel like you're drinking from a fire hydrant
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   as I wrap up and give you these five questions.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.020]   How do we guard our heart?
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.020]   Number one, who are you listening to?
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.020]   It says in verse 20, who are you listening to?
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   "My son, pay attention to what I say.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.020]   Turn your ear to my words.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.020]   Do not let them out of your sight.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.020]   Keep them within your heart."
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   Who are you listening to?
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.020]   Because we all have feedback bias and when we really, really want something,
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   we want to find a group of people that will say, "It's okay for you to want that.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.020]   It's okay for you to date him.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.020]   It's okay for you to watch that.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.020]   It's okay for you to go there.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.020]   It's okay for you to buy that."
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:19.020]   We want to surround ourselves with people who agree with us.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:24.020]   Who are you listening to, but not just community.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:28.020]   Like, what are you putting in your head through your ears?
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.020]   Because I have this conversation all the time.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   In fact, I've had it for 12 years.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   12 years, right here.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.020]   Look, right here, I had a conversation right here for 12 years.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.020]   People come up afterwards, "Hey, JP, young woman."
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.020]   Man, I just like, "Here's the problem.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.020]   You know, I just only date losers.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.020]   I don't know what it is.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.020]   I'm just attracted to losers.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.020]   It's just like they're like my type.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.020]   I don't know, like Enneagram loser.
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.020]   That's what I want."
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.020]   And I'll go, "Oh, okay.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.020]   I got you.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.020]   I got you.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.020]   Hey, what are you listening to?
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.020]   What do you mean what am I listening to?"
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.020]   I'm like, "Oh, man, what's your favorite songs right now?"
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.020]   "No, but I'm talking about dating."
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   "I know, just humor me for a minute.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.020]   What's your favorite songs right now?"
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.020]   "Oh, I don't know.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.020]   I mean, that new T-Swift album, you heard that?
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.020]   Antihero.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.020]   I mean, it jams.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.020]   It goes hard."
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.020]   "Oh, cool.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.020]   So you want a relationship like Taylor?"
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.020]   "Who else?
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.020]   Who else are you listening to?"
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.020]   "I mean, I don't know, you know, Miley Cyrus."
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.020]   "I can buy myself flowers."
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.020]   "You're going to be."
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.020]   "I'm not going to be."
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.020]   "You're going to be."
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.020]   "I'm not going to be."
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   "You're going to be."
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.020]   "I'm not going to be."
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.020]   "I'm not going to be."
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   "I'm not going to be."
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.020]   "I'm not going to be."
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:36.380]   "You're going to be.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.320]   You're going to have to because you keep dating losers, right?
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.220]   You know she just went through a divorce with a dude who cheated on her 14 times in the
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.920]   house that she made that music video in.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.540]   Did you know that?
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.500]   You're going to have to buy yourself flowers unless you start listening to something else."
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.420]   "Oh, you thought Doja Cat wasn't going to take you?"
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:04.380]   "Oh, you, I mean, for real, like Post Malone was going to make you love God more.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.740]   That's what you thought.
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.780]   That's really where we were thinking, like, oh no, but it's innocent.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.260]   It's just music.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.020]   Like what's the big deal?"
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:21.420]   "You thought Nicki Minaj wasn't going to hurt your relationship with Jesus.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.340]   Lil Uzi wasn't going to like take you out of intimacy with Christ."
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.220]   "No, for sure."
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.620]   "You sound like my grandma."
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.780]   "No, I sound like the wisest man that ever lived other than Jesus.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.500]   It's what he said."
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.420]   "Man, what's wrong with the world because everybody seems so anxious and depressed and,
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.860]   you know, porn and marriage rates are down and divorce rates are up.
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.860]   What's wrong with the world?"
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.580]   "What's wrong with our music?
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.580]   What you listening to?"
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.460]   "But you sure I got to guard it that much?"
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.940]   "Above everything else.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.940]   Above all else."
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:05.260]   Man, when I go to quiet time, God just feels so far.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:10.260]   It's in your heart.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.260]   It's not just songs.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.780]   I mean, listen to gossip.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.120]   For some of us it's sports.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:23.500]   We start to care too much about, you know, teams and basketballs or footballs or whatever.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.420]   It just can dominate.
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.060]   Number two, what are you saying?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.580]   Keep your mouth free of perversity.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.580]   Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.900]   What are you saying?
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.780]   What's coming out of your mouth?
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.420]   You say, "Does what we say really impact our heart?"
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.220]   Maybe more than anything else.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.500]   At least, listen to me, at least it will show you what's actually in your heart.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.300]   And this is really important if you're considering dating someone because you were like, "Well,
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.380]   how do I know if what's in their heart is good?
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.380]   What comes out of their mouth?"
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:00.620]   And we go to the words of Jesus if it's helpful, Matthew 15.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:05.740]   "But the things that come out of a person's mouth come from the heart, and these defile
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.740]   them.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.540]   For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft,
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.340]   false testimony, and slander, and these are what defile a person."
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:23.900]   I really like him, JP, but sometimes he'll say some things.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.380]   It's not gonna go well.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.420]   You think your cussing problem's cute.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.220]   No, your heart's not cute.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.220]   It's messed up.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:40.580]   And if it feels like legalism, the solution is not to leave here and try to stop.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.180]   The solution is A, know Jesus.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.820]   Understand who He is and what He's done for you.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:51.420]   And when you do, you have His Holy Spirit, and if you do know who Jesus is and what He's
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:55.740]   done for you, you surrender to that Spirit, the Spirit of God, the same Spirit that raised
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.860]   Christ from the dead.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.460]   He can help you stop cussing.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:05.540]   He can help you with your porn problem.
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:11.220]   He can help you with your gossip issue.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:16.700]   What's coming out of your mouth?
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.020]   Number three, where are you looking?
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.620]   Third question, where are you looking?
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.340]   It says in verse 25, "Let your eyes look straight ahead.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:33.380]   Fix your gaze directly before you."
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.620]   Where are you looking?
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.620]   Social media is so smart.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.020]   Like the way they do that, like you like just scroll over something slow.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.500]   And they're like, "Oh, you like that?
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   How about this?"
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:51.620]   You know, I used to be like into, I loved like MMA, martial arts and stuff.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.740]   And I, yeah, I'm not into it anymore, but I still like a sucker for a good like knockout
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   video.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.620]   I know that makes, I know I'm a terrible person, but, but I, and it's somehow Instagram has
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:06.620]   learned this because that explore page is dangerous.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.620]   You know, you, you know, amen, explore page dangerous.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.660]   And you're there and there's just like somebody gets knocked out.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.340]   I'm like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:14.340]   Wow."
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.180]   And I can't watch, but let me watch it again.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.180]   You know?
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:23.300]   And, and, and if I do, there's like, it's like places some violence in my heart.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.940]   You know, it's like somebody will come up afterwards like, "Hey, that sermon was terrible,
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.940]   man."
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   I'm like, "I bet if I hit you right."
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.940]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940]   I'm just joking.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.300]   There's a lot of judgment right there.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.500]   I was, that was a joke.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.020]   I'm just kidding, man.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.780]   I'm just joking.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.220]   Your heart, man.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.060]   It works like TikTok.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.780]   It's like, "Oh, you like that video?
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.780]   What about this video?
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:53.780]   What about this video?
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.780]   What about this video?
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:58.620]   Oh, you like, or maybe you're like, "Oh, we're not on TikTok.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.620]   We're Christian."
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.540]   Netflix.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.020]   It works like Netflix.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.940]   "Oh, you like The Office?
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.020]   How about Suits?
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.980]   How about this sitcom?
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.140]   What about this one and this one?
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.140]   Oh, you like that one?
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.140]   What about this one?"
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.260]   And it just starts to feed you more of what you feed it.
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.020]   It's like a bloodhound.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.540]   You put it on a scent and it's like, "All right, where are we going to go next?"
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.540]   You know?
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.820]   So, what are you looking at?
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:25.900]   What are you watching?
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.140]   Because it's going to feed you more of what you look at.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.260]   This is the lie of one last time.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.620]   It's like, "I'm never going to look at porn again.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.620]   This is the last time."
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:35.020]   No, you just fed something and it just grew.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.220]   And that appetite is stronger.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:42.800]   And the next time is going to be more difficult than that time because you fed it.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.940]   You looked at it again.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.500]   That's why you're stuck.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.220]   That's why you can't get well.
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.700]   You keep eating the monster.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.000]   You keep poisoning your heart.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.060]   You keep going back and looking at that.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:29:00.420]   Like right now, like these crime shows are, you know, true crime, snapped, right?
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:07.460]   Whatever, whatever, you're the one that you're watching, you know, the murders, serial podcast,
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.940]   Dateline NBC, Forensic Files.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.340]   There's like an obsession with this.
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.780]   And I was watching one the other day.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.660]   I was at my in-laws and it was on TV and I'm watching it.
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.660]   And it gets me sucked in.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.660]   I'm like, "Oh, okay.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.660]   What happened?
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:20.660]   When?
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.660]   And they didn't know.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.660]   And how did they not know?
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   And where are the murder weapons in the tank?
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.660]   What?"
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.780]   And I'm watching this and I'm just like feeling like my heart like grow for this.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.340]   And it goes and it talks about the murder and it says how much they were obsessed with
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.100]   these crime shows.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.060]   And then it says they went from watching their, you know, their crime shows, their murder
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:44.900]   shows to committing murder themselves, to making their own.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.380]   And I was like, "Wait, is that going to happen to me?"
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.460]   You know, I don't want to kill anybody.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.460]   You know, it's like, "Wait, hold on.
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.460]   Why am I going to feed my heart that then?
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.980]   Why am I going to feed my heart that?"
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.180]   It's like your iPhone.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.740]   It's always listening, you know.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.740]   You know how your iPhone works?
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.420]   You're like, "I need to buy a new rug."
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.580]   And it's like, "Oh, you want a rug?
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.900]   Check out Overstock has rugs.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.900]   Amazon has rugs.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.660]   Rooms to Go has rugs.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.660]   Rugs are us."
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.700]   You know, everywhere you look, there's like, I mean, there's like rugs everywhere, you
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.860]   know.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.220]   It's always listening.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.220]   It's always listening.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.260]   You watch these shows, you know.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.820]   Summer I Turned Pretty, you know.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.180]   Is that what it's called?
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.180]   How do you know?
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.180]   See?
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.180]   Watch it.
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.180]   Right?
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.100]   It's like in Waco, there's a show in Waco called Fixer Upper.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.020]   Yeah, man, I love that stuff.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.540]   It's like the best thing on TV.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.920]   Chip and Joe.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.700]   And I'll watch it.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.860]   And I'm like, "Babe, we need a new house."
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.780]   And she's like, in real talk, she's like, "We just got a new house."
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.620]   And I'm like, "No, we need an old house that we can make new."
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.580]   She's like, "But we just built a new house."
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:12.820]   And I was like, "I know, but I wish we would have bought an old house that we could, you
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.460]   know, make new again."
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:19.380]   And she's like, "Something, it's weird how your desires grow when you feed them like
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.500]   that.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.100]   The pure in heart will set no evil thing before their eyes."
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.180]   Number four, when do you plan your path?
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.620]   When do you plan your path?
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:41.140]   Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.700]   Give careful thought to your path.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:51.220]   Guys, you're not gonna grow in your relationship with Jesus if you don't set a time aside for
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.540]   Him every day.
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.860]   I was talking to a friend the other day and he was talking about his own anxiety and depression.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.340]   And he said, "Prayer healed me."
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.500]   And I said, "Oh, like you prayed for healing and got niggas?"
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   "No, no, no, no.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.800]   Like the activity of prayer actually cleaned my mind."
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.940]   And he was telling me about this and I was kind of thinking about my own experience with
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.620]   anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.140]   And I was like, "Oh, I see how that can happen.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.140]   I'm not saying, I'm not trying to put a bandaid on your, you know, gaping wound.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.220]   I'm not saying, 'Hey, just pray it away.'
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:31.760]   I am saying that there's something to this setting a time aside to plan our path.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:37.680]   And if you're not doing that, like today's the time to start.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.640]   And you just put it on your calendar just like anything else that's important to you
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.860]   and just prioritize it from there.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.020]   And number five, why do you stray?
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.260]   Why do you stray?
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.340]   That's like asking how would the enemy take you out?
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.360]   He says in verse 27, "Do not turn to the right or the left.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.500]   Keep your foot from evil."
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.460]   If something is evil, don't touch it.
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.580]   Don't poke it.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.940]   Don't sniff it.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.980]   Don't get near it.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:10.820]   And it's interesting to me how your peers think, "Oh, you know, it's just like a little
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:11.820]   manifesting.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.100]   You know, it's not really prayer.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.100]   It's manifesting.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   Oh, it's satanic.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   It's demonic.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.140]   What you're doing is of the devil."
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.140]   Well, it's just crystals.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.700]   It's just a rock.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:25.060]   It's like, no, it's a rock with demonic power is what it is.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.060]   You're playing with evil things.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.380]   Don't do it.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.900]   Don't get close to it.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.420]   Because when you do what you do with the scripture, it literally says is you give the devil a
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.420]   foothold.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.060]   If you've ever been like climbing, it's like you just give him in your life, in your heart,
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.900]   you said, "Hey, put your foot here.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.900]   Hang out here.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.900]   Come around.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.460]   Stick with me.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.460]   Let's be buds."
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.260]   You give him a foothold.
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:57.020]   Like for me, like my history is an addiction to pornography, sexual addiction.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.020]   It owned me.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.020]   It devoured me.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.820]   And so I got to be really careful what I watch.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.660]   And there's a kind of show I love where it's like that you have this kind of moral hero,
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:16.260]   this person that it has like a real sense of justice, but they're also very skilled
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.060]   in like martial arts or, you know, think like born identity, born supremacy.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.300]   And so we're talking through this and my buddy's like, "Oh, you should see, you know, talk
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.860]   about Jack Ryan or, you know, Terminalist."
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.100]   He's like, "You should watch Reacher.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.100]   You should watch Reacher."
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.540]   And man, he's like, "It's right up here."
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   I was like, "Oh man, it is.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.540]   I'm watching Reacher."
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.260]   I'm like, "This is so good.
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260]   I love it."
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.060]   And now here's what it's like, because the scripture says, you know, the enemy is the
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.060]   devil.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:44.220]   And so what I feel like my relationship with lust is like, it's like the devil is, he says,
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.700]   "The enemy of your devil is a lion."
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.620]   It's like there's a lion on the other side of this door and it's like, I got the door
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.220]   locked, padlocked, put a big bar in front of it.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.060]   And I just like sit here with my back against that door all the time.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.460]   I'm like, I'm not going to let the devil in, you know, right.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.860]   And I'm watching Reacher.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.860]   And all of a sudden like that, there's a shower scene.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.300]   Like that, it's on the screen.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.300]   I'm like, "Whoa, whoa."
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.180]   That's all it took though.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.260]   What it's like in that moment, that moment, it's like I walk over to that door, unlock
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:21.340]   the padlock, move this, move the chain, take out the bar, turn the knob, crack it open,
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.140]   come and get me.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:32.300]   And then everything that I see the next day, everywhere I look, it's just kind of contaminated.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.060]   It's just poisoned.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:44.780]   Because I fed my heart something that's not good for my heart.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.620]   Why do you stray?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:55.540]   The pure in heart eliminate evil from their lives at all costs.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:01.020]   So be careful what you let in your heart by asking these questions.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.940]   Who are you listening to?
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.620]   What are you saying?
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:08.980]   Where are you looking?
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:11.900]   When do you plan your path?
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.220]   And why do you stray?
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:23.440]   The absolute tragedy in this text is that the one who penned it, the one who wrote it
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.100]   did not follow his own advice.
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.140]   And it says that his heart was led astray.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.180]   This is what it says in 1 Kings 11, talking about Solomon.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:36.780]   It says, "As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:43.180]   heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God as the heart of David his father has been."
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.100]   And we have an entire book in the Scriptures known as Ecclesiastes that shows us that
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:52.740]   King Solomon, the man who had more money than anyone who has ever lived before, his whole
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:58.900]   life is an experiment on wealth and the lust of pleasure.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:06.540]   And it says that he died in deep depression and despair because his heart was turned away.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.140]   This is where it went.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.940]   Solomon is an awful God.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:18.660]   Jesus, on the other hand, was tempted in every way that you've been tempted, but he did not
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.380]   sin.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.020]   It says, "For the joy set before him, he endured the cross, scorning its shame."
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:31.020]   It says, "Let us run the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:36.500]   the perfecter of our faith, throwing off the sin that so easily entangles us."
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:42.300]   Because somewhere in this message, in your heart, you might ask the question, "How serious
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.540]   do I need to take it?"
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:49.100]   And I'm just going to tell you, I don't know that you can take it too serious.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:58.300]   I don't know what subscription you need to cancel, what phone you need to sell, what
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.780]   you need to cut out.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.820]   But don't just cut out things.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.540]   You have to let the gospel in.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:13.060]   You have to know that this God sent his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for your sins, and
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.660]   he raised him from the dead.
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.500]   And that if you believe in that, you will not perish, but you will live forever, not
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.980]   because of what you've done, but because of what he did on your behalf.
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:26.380]   Friends, I stumbled into this place hungover.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:29.220]   I smelled like smoke from the night before.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:35.520]   I loved the $2 margarita specials on Tuesday.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.100]   And I would go to the clubs, and I would go to the bars, and I would go to the girls'
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:45.380]   apartments, and I would go to all the places that weren't good for me.
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.780]   And you know how a GPS works?
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.380]   It wants to take you to the places you've been before.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.020]   "Oh, I know where you're going.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.860]   Here, just let's go."
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.620]   And those addresses, they'll hang out in that GPS.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.260]   But if you start putting new addresses in, "No, I'm going to go to community group.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.900]   No, I'm going to go to church.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:04.300]   No, I'm going to go to the porch.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.060]   No, I'm going to go hang out with these friends.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.860]   All of a sudden, I'm going to change my playmates and my playground."
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.500]   And those old addresses fall out, and new addresses replace them.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   And you heal your heart.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.300]   You surround yourself with the things of Jesus.
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.900]   Right now, the question for you is, do you have more inputs of the world or more inputs
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.360]   of the kingdom?
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.020]   Have you set your destination on your new home?
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.900]   Is it set to the right destination?
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:36.940]   If it's not, it's no wonder why your life continues to take you the way of sin.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.740]   I'm going to pray for you that you would.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:55.580]   Father, would you help us renew our minds, have a new hope, see your desires for us,
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:00.940]   and what you've done for us in Christ?
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:09.260]   Even as we sing this song, will you just help us to look at the cross and deeply into an
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.060]   empty tomb?
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.780]   And right now, Lord, would you convict us?
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.100]   Would you show us what relationships we need to remove?
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.780]   What destinations we need to stop going to?
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.080]   What show we need to stop watching?
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.500]   What song we need to stop listening to?
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.260]   What book we need to stop reading?
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.860]   Who we need to stop hanging out with?
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:38.420]   And God, would you give us a greater affection for Christ, that we wouldn't just become smarter
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:43.740]   sinners, but we would live the lives of saints?
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.820]   Surrender to your Holy Spirit.
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.140]   In the name of Jesus, amen.
