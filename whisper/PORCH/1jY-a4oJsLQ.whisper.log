[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:25.160]   What's up, Porch?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.560]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.760]   Hey, it is so good to see you.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.960]   Hope that all is well.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.120]   If this is your first time ever, so glad you made it.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.680]   Thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.720]   My name is Timothy Atteague, and I'm
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.960]   one of the teaching pastors here on Tuesday nights
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.680]   as well as Sunday mornings.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.200]   And I do want to give a shout out to all the Porch Live
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.240]   locations that are watching right now.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.560]   I want to say a special hello to Porch Live Indy, Porch Live
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.480]   Greater Lafayette, Porch Live Tulsa.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.600]   So glad that you're tuning in tonight.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.880]   I hope that all is well with you.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.120]   Here's the reality.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.160]   If you've been at the Porch for a little bit,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.480]   then you have heard me share often
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.560]   about my years in my days as a young adult.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.120]   And I just figure it is worth you
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.240]   having a visual of what I looked like when I was 24.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.520]   So let me just show you a picture.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.640]   You can get just an image in your head.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.040]   I don't know why you're laughing.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.040]   That's super offensive.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:40.080]   So one person saw this earlier, and she
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.840]   said, if I saw you standing on the side of the road,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.040]   I would be scared.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.840]   And that was hurtful.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.200]   Those shorts, I did not cut those off.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.600]   I bought them that way from Abercrombie and Fitch.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.520]   I was wearing those Chacos.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   And I don't know what else to say about it, guys.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.360]   That just-- God did a great work in my life since then.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.680]   That's, I think, what I can say about that.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.840]   Here's what you need to know is that picture actually
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.080]   was taken at a time when I was in Europe
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.680]   right after the Lord wrecked my life and began rebuilding it.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.840]   So when I look at that picture, I kind of
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   see past the cut off khaki shorts.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.520]   I see past the Chacos.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.440]   I see past the hair.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.080]   I see past all of that.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320]   And I see all of the goodness that God
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.800]   had done in my life over the past month
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.200]   that I had been out of the country.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   Because a month before that, my life
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.880]   had really crashed into rock bottom
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.760]   due to compromising decisions.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.120]   I was living in the midst of a bunch of unnecessary pain.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   A couple of weeks ago, I told you
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.080]   that there's a difference between unavoidable pain
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.680]   and unnecessary pain.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.160]   Unavoidable pain is the pain that will find you.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680]   You don't have to go looking for it.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   It will track you down.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.840]   But then there's unnecessary pain.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   And it's what comes from compromising decisions
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.120]   in your life.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.680]   I tell you that because when I look back to when I was 24,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.760]   there's various things that I can look back and I can say,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.320]   I'm so glad that I did that.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.760]   Like, I'm so glad that I took that trip to Europe
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.800]   with friends.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.600]   I'm so glad that I did some spontaneous road trips.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.480]   I'm so glad that I went back to A&M
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.960]   to watch some football games.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.000]   Like, there's a lot of things that I did when I was 24
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.120]   that I'm glad I did.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.480]   I'm glad that I jumped in and volunteered with Lake Highlands
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.120]   Young Life and invested in high school kids.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.760]   And at the same time, there's various things
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.920]   that I can look back at that I did when I was 24.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.240]   And I look back and I just think, what was I thinking?
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   And so the reason that I bring that up is what's interesting
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.320]   is if you think about where you're at right now,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.360]   whether you're 27 or 32 or you just graduated college
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.060]   and you just moved to Dallas, what's interesting
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.640]   is 10 years from now, 15 years from now, 20 years from now,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.160]   you're going to look back onto this moment.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.120]   You're going to look back on who you were at 2023
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   and you're going to have a picture of yourself
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.720]   and you're going to see it.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.880]   And it's going to jog your memory about the life
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.080]   you were living right now.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.580]   And there's going to be things that you're going to look back
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.800]   and you're going to think, I'm so glad I did that.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.500]   And then there's going to be other things
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.360]   that you're actually doing right now in your life.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.080]   10 years from now, 15 years from now,
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.000]   you're going to look back on this time, this season,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.040]   and you're going to say, what was I thinking?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.880]   Isn't that crazy to think about?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.680]   You're going to think, what was I thinking?
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.400]   Why did I date him?
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.240]   Why did I date her?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.960]   Why did I go there?
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.640]   That was such a terrible idea.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.680]   What was I thinking?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.160]   And so there's been various times in my life
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.280]   where people have asked me, hey, if you could go back
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.080]   and talk to your younger self, what
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.720]   would you tell your younger self?
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.400]   And so that's what I want to do tonight.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200]   I want to share with you five things
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.040]   that I would share with my young adult self.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.240]   Like if I could go back and talk to 24-year-old Timothy
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.320]   Attiq, there's five things that I would share with him.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.400]   And what's interesting is the five things
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.440]   that I'm going to share aren't my own.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.240]   Like this is not my own material.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.760]   They just come straight out of the end
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.240]   of the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.440]   They actually come from King Solomon.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.820]   If you're new to the porch, we've
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.640]   been in a series walking through the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.720]   You might not be familiar with Ecclesiastes,
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   but it's considered wisdom literature,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.800]   which means it can show you how to live a wise life.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   It was written by one of the wisest people
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.160]   to ever walk on the face of the earth.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.600]   It is highly applicable to the lives of young adults.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.960]   In fact, right there at the end of the book,
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.840]   you know what it is?
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.480]   Is it is King Solomon who is old in life,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.640]   and he's basically giving his swan song
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.960]   to the next generation.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.040]   He is speaking into the lives of young adults.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.200]   And what we're going to see King Solomon say
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.120]   to the next generation, and what ends up
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.760]   being the five things that I would say to my young adult
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.180]   self are the things that I want to share with you tonight.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.080]   The five things that we're going to see from King Solomon
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.580]   is this.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.160]   I'll share them with you now, and then
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.000]   we'll begin to walk through it.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.440]   First, before you follow your heart,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.720]   you need a new and cultivated heart.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.920]   Number two, embrace where God has you.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.560]   Number three, today is the best day
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.680]   to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.920]   Number four, your view of God determines your response to God.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.380]   And number five, never get over the gospel.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.080]   That's what we're going to unpack tonight.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.800]   If I could go back and talk to my 24-year-old self,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.200]   that's what I would tell him.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.100]   And that's what I hope you hear tonight.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.640]   So if you have a Bible, turn with me
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.320]   to Ecclesiastes chapter 11.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.920]   We're going to start in 11, and then we're
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.520]   going to go through the end of the book,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.720]   and we're going to finish our series tonight.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:44.920]   [AUDIO OUT]
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.360]   Ecclesiastes chapter 11 is where we're
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.440]   going to find our first truth, which
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.600]   is before you follow your heart, you
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.880]   need a new and cultivated heart.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.920]   So from King Solomon talking to the next generation,
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.760]   that is what he wants you to know.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.800]   Look at what he says in verse 9.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   He says, "Rejoice, O young man, in your youth."
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.200]   Rejoice, O young man, in your youth,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.720]   and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.880]   Do you see what he's saying?
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.280]   He's saying, look, your young adult years,
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.600]   they are great years.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.320]   Like, enjoy them.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.480]   Make the most of the years that you have right now.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.120]   Like, don't let these years slip by.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.080]   That's what he's saying when he says, let your heart cheer you
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.440]   in the days of your youth.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.280]   And then he goes on, and watch what he says.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.240]   He says, "Walk in the ways of your heart."
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.240]   We might say in our day, follow your heart.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   Walk in the ways of your heart in the sight of your eyes,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.680]   but know that for all these things,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.440]   God will bring you into judgment.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.800]   So this is very interesting, because what Solomon is doing
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.680]   is he's like putting bumpers on the bowling alley lane.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.440]   He's like, look, there's room for you to take--
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.320]   there's a fairway, and there are bumpers
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   that will keep you on track.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.120]   The reason I say that is he says, follow your heart,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.800]   but just remember that God will bring you into judgment.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.240]   So when Solomon says, follow your heart, and when he says,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.600]   walk in the sight of your eyes, here's what he's getting at.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.800]   He's saying, look, you have more freedom right now
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.880]   than you will ever have in your life.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.600]   And I know some of you guys are crushing 60 hours a week,
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.320]   but here's what I'm really saying.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.760]   What I'm saying is you will only gain more responsibility
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.600]   the older you get.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.480]   Like if you get married, you're going to have a wife.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.160]   If you have kids, you're going to have a husband or wife
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.480]   and kids, and you might work your way up in your job.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.360]   I was talking to one guy in his 60s recently,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.320]   and he was like, I had worked myself to a place
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.440]   where I had five kids at home and 20 kids at work.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.600]   What was he saying?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.040]   He was like, my life was full of responsibility.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.880]   But right now, in your young adult years,
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.440]   this is the most free you'll ever be.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.880]   So what Solomon is saying is even though you are still busy,
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.160]   responsibility is only going to increase.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.800]   So don't waste this time.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.120]   Don't miss it, because you're full of passion.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.680]   The heart is like the control center of your being.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.520]   It speaks to your thoughts and your desires,
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.440]   your motivations, your dreams.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.280]   And so what Solomon is saying is, hey, you've got dreams.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.520]   You've got ambitions.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.320]   You've got desires.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.120]   And you should pursue those.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.040]   Don't wait till some someday when
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.840]   it feels like all the stars align for you
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.440]   to finally follow your passions and follow your ambitions.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.280]   He's saying, do it now.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.680]   When he says, walk in the sight of your eyes,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.840]   your eyes are the way that you perceive opportunity.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.200]   So Solomon is saying, look, if you're beholding opportunity,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.400]   step into it.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.400]   Let's go.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.480]   Don't wait around.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.120]   Don't wait for someday.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.560]   Today is the day.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.080]   Get moving.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.160]   Do it.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.400]   And at the same time, he puts bumpers on it.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.360]   And he says, just remember, though, for all of these
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.680]   things, remember, God will bring you into judgment.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.960]   What's he saying there?
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.360]   He's saying, look, follow your passions.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.640]   But just remember, God cares about your passions.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.520]   Follow your dreams.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.680]   But remember, God cares about your dreams
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.600]   and your opportunities.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.520]   Not every passion or dream or opportunity is worth following.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.960]   God cares about how you live now.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.360]   So that's why the point is, before you follow your heart,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.240]   you need a new and cultivated heart.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.120]   What I'm really saying is, before you follow your dreams,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.400]   you just need to make sure that they're godly dreams.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.120]   And before you follow your desires,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.800]   you just need to make sure that they're godly desires.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.160]   We live in a day and time where we love the idea of just doing
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.320]   what feels right.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.480]   But let's just be clear.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.040]   Sometimes really bad things are going to feel really good.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.080]   Like things that lead to really major brokenness in your life
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.160]   can feel really good at different points.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.880]   So it's just good to have an understanding of our hearts.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.680]   We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.000]   Jeremiah 17 9 says, "The heart is deceitful above all things
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.160]   and desperately sick."
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.960]   Who can understand it?
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.640]   The heart is described as deceitful.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.400]   Like your heart, apart from Jesus, it will deceive you.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.560]   And it will lead you to do dumb things.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.200]   But the good news of the gospel is
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.800]   that we are promised a new heart in Jesus.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.000]   That's why I say, before you follow your heart,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.520]   you need a new heart.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.760]   Ezekiel 36 26 says, "And I will give you
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.920]   a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.400]   And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.160]   and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.360]   So when you come to know Jesus Christ,
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.800]   you're not a bad person that becomes good.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.520]   You're a dead person that becomes new.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.480]   And part of that is that you're given a new heart, which
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.240]   has new desires.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.760]   And so your dreams become more in line
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.120]   with God's dreams for you.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.840]   Your desires become more in line with God's desires for you.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.400]   But before you follow your heart,
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.520]   you don't just need a new heart.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.140]   You need a cultivated heart.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.120]   Here's what I mean.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.000]   God might put a new heart within you,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.720]   but that heart needs to be cultivated.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.120]   Like, you're not just going to magically trust in Jesus
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.760]   and then everything always in your life is just about Jesus.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.960]   Like, you wake up every morning and all you want to do
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   is be where Jesus is.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.440]   And all you want to do is what Jesus wants you to do.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.160]   No, there's still a battle inside of you.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   So that heart has to be cultivated by Jesus.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.400]   So what does that look like?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.320]   Well, let me explain it this way.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.240]   I'm a big Dallas Cowboys football fan.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.080]   Like, I don't know if there's any Cowboys fans.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.160]   I don't know what your team is.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.720]   Whoever your team is, you can just apply it to your situation.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.640]   But I want you-- here's what I want you to think about.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.200]   I want you to think about this.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.160]   What if the Cowboys are on offense
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.640]   and they got into the huddle and Dak Prescott was like,
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.240]   here's what I'm thinking, guys.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.360]   Everybody just follow your heart.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.840]   Like, that's what I'm going to do?
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.360]   I'm going to follow my heart?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.920]   Pollard, what are you thinking?
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.000]   You're going to follow your heart behind me?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.840]   Great.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.520]   C.D. Lamb, what are you thinking?
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.000]   You're going to go out and follow your heart?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.080]   Whatever you want to do.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.760]   Offensive line, what are you thinking?
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.720]   Don't tell me.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.640]   Follow your heart.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.720]   We'll just see what happens.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.680]   Can you imagine how chaotic that would be?
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.240]   It would be crazy if Dak was like,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.400]   I'm going to follow my heart.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.240]   Everyone, you just do whatever you want to do,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.600]   and it's going to be great.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.640]   It won't be great because you actually
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.600]   have an opposing team that has been watching film
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.320]   on how to take you down.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.400]   And the same is true in the spiritual realm.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.160]   We have an enemy who is seeking to take us down.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.760]   And so when we just do whatever we want to do,
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.480]   a lot of times it doesn't go well.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.840]   What do you see Dak Prescott doing in between each play?
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.640]   If you watch him, you're going to see him
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.680]   covering up his ears.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.880]   Why?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.680]   Because there's comms in his helmet
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.200]   and his coach is calling the play.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.440]   If the comms not working, he's going to look to the sideline
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.320]   to get the play.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.040]   Do you know what it looks like to cultivate your heart?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.760]   To cultivate your heart is to consistently look
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.000]   to the sideline.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.960]   You look to the coach to call the play.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.040]   God is the coach.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.880]   He is the one who is after our joy.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.520]   He wants us to walk in fullness of joy.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.160]   But that fullness of joy comes from our desires, our dreams,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.080]   our motivations being driven by him.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   So when Solomon says, get going, walk
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.760]   in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes,
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.800]   what he's saying is, hey, when your heart and your sight
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.000]   are aligned with God, something amazing
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.200]   can happen in your young adult years.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.560]   But what does it look like to look to the sidelines?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.720]   Well, number one, you've got to come to Jesus.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.800]   Like if you don't know Jesus, if you're here tonight
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.600]   and you're not a Christian, like you're just
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.320]   checking this thing out, you thought it was a restaurant
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.560]   and it's actually a church, you got tricked.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.520]   But you're still-- you're here.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.960]   So you might as well explore it.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.880]   Come to Jesus.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.160]   Put your trust in him.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.520]   But don't just come to Jesus.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.760]   Live surrendered to Jesus.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.440]   Don't just make Jesus your savior.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.360]   Let him be your king.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.400]   Let him reign in your life.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.880]   And then submit to his word.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.120]   You can't know God's ways without knowing his word.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.440]   Don't just know what other people say.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.840]   Know what God says.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.600]   He's the coach.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.040]   He calls the plays.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.480]   And then walk with others.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.280]   Invite other Jesus followers into your life
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.120]   who can help you identify, hey, I
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.080]   don't think that that desire is in line with God's desires.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.120]   Don't follow your heart in this situation
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   because it's going to mislead you.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.000]   So if I were to talk to my young adult self,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.080]   here's what I would tell them.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.040]   I would just say, before you follow your heart,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.920]   you need a new and cultivated heart.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.000]   The second thing that I would tell them
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   is I would just say, embrace where God has you.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.280]   Embrace it.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.600]   When I say embrace, I am saying hug the place
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.440]   where God has you now.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.000]   Look at what Solomon says in verse 10.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.760]   He says, "Remove vexation from your heart.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   Put away pain from your body for your youth.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.720]   In the dawn of life are vanity."
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.520]   I want to break down what he's saying here.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.800]   When he says the dawn of life, that
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.320]   can be translated the prime of life.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.800]   You are in the prime of life right now.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.240]   Congratulations.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.200]   You made it.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.040]   You're there.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.560]   You are officially in the prime of life.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:42.120]   That word dawn, it literally means black or blackened.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.240]   It's talking about the hair.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.080]   Like you're in the stage of life where there is no gray hair
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.720]   yet.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.920]   What's that like?
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.280]   It's been a minute since I was there.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.400]   But he's saying, look, the dawn of life, youth
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.200]   and the dawn of life, they're vanity.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.960]   That word vanity, it's the word that's
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.040]   used most in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.160]   It's the Hebrew word hevel.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.280]   It literally means mist or vapor.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.560]   So it's like that steam that comes out
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.960]   of your mouth on a cold day.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.000]   It's like trying to catch that.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.240]   It's impossible.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.880]   It's so fleeting.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.960]   So Solomon's point is your youthfulness, the prime of life,
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.360]   it is so fleeting.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.120]   It will flash by.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.560]   What's crazy is this is how young adulthood goes.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.480]   You graduate from college.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.080]   And for the first 10 years after you graduate college,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.280]   you feel like you just graduated college.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.200]   But think about this.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.120]   If you're 25, you were a freshman in college
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.840]   seven years ago.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.000]   Seven years ago.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.960]   If you're 30, you were a freshman in college 12 years
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.920]   ago.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.800]   That's how fast time moves.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.760]   It flies by.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.120]   And so Solomon's point is, hey, the prime of life goes fast.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.440]   So don't spend all of your time missing out on joy
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.480]   during the season.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.520]   Instead, what does he say?
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.560]   He says remove vexation.
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.080]   Do you know what vexation is?
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.600]   It's referring to unnecessary emotional anxiety
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.240]   and frustration.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.800]   Saying don't spend all of the prime of your life frustrated.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.480]   And yet I feel like so many young adults
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.480]   spend all of their young adult years frustrated waiting
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.240]   for the next season of life to come.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.040]   Like they will truly be satisfied and happy
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   in the next chapter, but not in this chapter.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.800]   And that was me.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.240]   That 24-year-old you saw in that picture,
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.120]   I hated being single.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.360]   Hated it.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.400]   I actually had a friend, my best friend,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.960]   here's what he told me.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:22.400]   He said you are just happier when you're in a relationship.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.960]   Why?
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.800]   Because I needed that.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   I needed a girl in my life to feel valuable,
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.960]   to feel that companionship, to have those plans,
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.360]   to feel wanted.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.120]   I needed that to feel satisfied.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.000]   And so in all of the days that I was single,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.360]   I was frustrated.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.520]   And I wonder if that's you.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.320]   I wonder if you're just frustrated.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.080]   You look around at other people and you're frustrated.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.600]   Maybe it's not about a relationship.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:55.400]   Maybe you're just frustrated that you're not in the job
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.680]   that you want to be.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.040]   Like I know a lot of young adults, they graduate college,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.120]   they get their first job, they're really excited about it,
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.760]   they're finally making their own money,
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.600]   and then you get into the job and you're like, wait a second,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.280]   there is no more summer break.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.000]   Like spring break isn't a thing.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.240]   Like this is just, this is your life now.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.120]   And you're like this job, like there is so many layers
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.880]   of management above me and this feels
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.480]   like it's not fully maximizing who I am as a person.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.400]   And so you get three months in and you're like, oh my gosh,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.160]   I only have nine more months until my apartment lease is up.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.520]   Because you're just ready to move on to the next thing.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.600]   You're frustrated.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.880]   Let me just encourage you, don't spend all
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.400]   of your young adult years longing for the next thing.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.440]   Embrace where God has you now.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   And let me just tell you, the best way to experience more joy
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.000]   with where God has you now, stop looking around
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.280]   and comparing yourself to other people.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.400]   Stop comparing.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.720]   Stop comparing how much money you have
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.280]   versus how much they have.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.680]   Stop being frustrated that they have the Tesla and you don't.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.600]   Stop being frustrated that they take the extravagant vacations
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.320]   to Europe and you don't.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.640]   Stop getting frustrated that they get to go out to eat and go
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.560]   to happy hour and buy drinks more than you get to.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.960]   Embrace where God has you.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.520]   It is what it is.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.400]   And God has good plans for you now.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.160]   He wants to do something in your life now.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.880]   And so don't miss it.
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.560]   Now here's what I'm not saying.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.120]   It's OK if you're single and you want to be married.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   That's a good desire.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.200]   You don't need to do this thing where you're like,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.800]   OK God, I don't want anyone.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:58.640]   I mean, he looks amazing, but I don't even want him.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.160]   No.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.840]   Like you don't need to-- let's not be fake.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.920]   It's OK to acknowledge he would be nice.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.280]   She sounds great.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   But like I'm not going to bank on a relationship.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:21.280]   I'm not going to bet all of my joy on a relationship.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.400]   Find your joy in Jesus and where he has you right now.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:25.920]   Number three.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.400]   Today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.200]   If I could talk to 24-year-old TA, that's what I would tell him.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.160]   I would say, today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.720]   And you might be like, I know your story.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.280]   Weren't you in seminary at the time?
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.040]   And you know what happened to me?
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.640]   I let serving Jesus replace knowing Jesus.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.000]   And so what I would tell him is I would say, today is the best day to
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.880]   wholeheartedly follow Jesus and know Jesus.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.360]   Watch this.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.880]   This is chapter 12.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.800]   Chapter 12 is masterful.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.000]   OK.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.680]   Watch what Solomon says.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.320]   Verse 1, he says, "Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.400]   the evil days come and the years draw near, of which you will say, 'I have no
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.840]   pleasure in them.'" So what's he saying?
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.560]   He's saying right now, while you're still young in your young adult years, like
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.240]   remember your Creator now before you get old.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.800]   Because when you're old, it's not nearly as enjoyable.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.600]   Life is not nearly as enjoyable as it is now.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.120]   And what's interesting is he refers to God as Creator.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:36.640]   Why?
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.080]   Because he's trying to transport us all the way back to the beginning of the
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.720]   Bible at creation, where everything was perfect.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.840]   And Adam and Eve had a perfect relationship with God, where they saw
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.800]   God face to face, and they enjoyed his presence.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.040]   And yet what happened is they rebelled against God.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.560]   And because they rebelled against God, they were removed from the presence of
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.240]   God.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.880]   They could no longer walk by sight.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.240]   They had to walk by faith.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.080]   And so sin had broken into the picture and fractured our relationship with God.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.280]   And yet what Jesus has done is he has come.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.360]   And what he's done is he's come to repair that broken relationship that each one of
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.800]   us has with God.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.600]   And he's come so that we could begin to taste what life was like with God in the
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.120]   garden.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.840]   That's why he says, "Remember also your Creator."
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.080]   Because he's saying, "Look, I want you to taste what Adam and Eve experienced at
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.000]   creation."
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.320]   You can experience nearness with God.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.920]   You can experience his presence.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.400]   You can experience intimacy and joy just being with him.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.600]   So when he says, "Remember your Creator," what he's not saying is, "Hey,
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.200]   every Tuesday night, check in with God."
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.840]   No, what he's saying is, "Walk with him now.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.960]   Passionately pursue him now.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.160]   Enjoy him wholeheartedly now.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.840]   Do it now before the evil days and years draw near of which you will say,
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.880]   'I have no pleasure in them.'"
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:12.160]   What he's talking about is he's talking about getting old.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:19.240]   And then in verses 2 through 7, Solomon shares this poem about getting old.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.640]   And it's one long run-on sentence, and the idea is that if you were to just read
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.120]   this thing straight through, you would be out of breath.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.640]   And the idea is that it's like as your breath runs out, it's like the clock runs
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.280]   out on your life.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.360]   So just watch what he says.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.000]   He says, "Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars are darkened
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.600]   and the clouds return after the rain."
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.680]   You know what he's saying?
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:51.600]   He's saying like, "The older you get, the darker your days get."
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:57.040]   And like one storm is going to hit your life, and just as that storm is passing,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.880]   there's new clouds already coming in.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.240]   Like the older you get, you get to a point where it's just like one health issue
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.680]   after the next, and you're going to doctors that you can't even pronounce the
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.120]   name of their ologist.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.400]   You know, like it's too hard to say.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.000]   And you're going to specialists after specialists, and you're going to way more
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.480]   funerals than you're going to weddings.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   You're burying more and more friends.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.200]   He's like, "Don't wait till that day to start walking with God."
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.080]   Then he goes on, verse 3, "In the day when the keepers of the house tremble."
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.520]   He's talking about your arms and your hands.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.760]   Like a day is coming where your arms and hands, they're going to shake,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.000]   and you don't want them to shake.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.640]   Like my aunt is 92, and she jokes because she's got a tremor in her hand,
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.040]   and she's like, "I can't hold a hamburger because by the time it got to my mouth,
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.880]   all of the fixings will be gone."
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:00.560]   But it's a tremor that she didn't ask for, but that's just a part of her being 92.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.920]   "In the days when the keepers of the house tremble, in the strong men are bent."
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.120]   That's talking about your legs, the older you get, your legs get bent,
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.440]   and you begin to walk hunched over.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:19.280]   "In the grinders," those are your teeth, "your grinders cease because they are few."
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.840]   He's saying your teeth fall out.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:29.640]   "In those who look through the windows are dimmed, your eyesight begins to fade."
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   It goes bad.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.680]   Don't wait till then to finally start walking with Jesus.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.080]   Verse 4, "In the doors on the street are shut when the sound of the grinding is loud."
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:45.160]   That's talking about your ears, that you become more and more hard of hearing.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.200]   And watch this, "And one rises up at the sound of a bird."
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   It's like that bird chirps once, and you're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's happening?
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.200]   What's happening?"
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.280]   Like my 92-year-old aunt, I was staying with her last month, or at the beginning of this
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   month.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.280]   You know what she said?
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:07.400]   She said, "I have 3.30 in the morning," because she can't sleep past 3.30.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.680]   That's just her reality.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.080]   She doesn't set an alarm.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.920]   That is just, when you get, the older you get, the harder it is to sleep.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.840]   "All the daughters of song are brought low."
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.800]   That's talking about the vocal cords that no longer have the elastic strength.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.520]   Verse 5, "They are afraid also of what is high."
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.100]   It's like, that's too high.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.100]   Can you reach that for me?
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.240]   I'm kind of scared of what could happen.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.280]   Like what I will pull, just trying to reach for it.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.560]   And terrors are in the way.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.680]   The almond tree blossoms.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:48.120]   Almond trees, almond trees are pale in the springtime.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.960]   This is talking about someone's hair which has turned white with age.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.360]   The grasshopper drags itself along.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   What an image.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.320]   There's just, there's no spring in your step anymore.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:08.380]   It's like, just to walk is kind of a miserable process.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:12.120]   And then he goes on, he's like, "And desire fails."
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:17.560]   Which is so interesting that Solomon, the guy with hundreds of wives and concubines,
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:27.380]   is like, "Even in the old age, the thing that I couldn't get enough of has finally dissipated.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.200]   Like even my sexual desire is gone."
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.120]   He's saying as an old man.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:39.240]   He says, "Because man is going to his eternal home and the mourners go about the streets."
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.880]   Verse 6 says, "Before the silver cord is snapped."
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.400]   He's describing here a well from which you draw water.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.900]   He's saying, "Before the silver cord is snapped or the golden bowl is broken or the pitcher
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.080]   is shattered at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern."
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.080]   What's his point?
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:00.120]   All of these things work together to draw up life-giving water.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.560]   And he's like, "The things that hold life-giving water are broken."
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.520]   It's like your body, you reach a point in life where your body is no longer capable
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.560]   of holding life and you die.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:21.600]   And so he says in verse 7, "And the dust returns to the earth as it was.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.400]   And the spirit returns to God who gave it."
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.880]   In verse 8, this is the refrain that he started the book with.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:36.160]   He says, "Vanity of vanity," says the preacher, "it is all, all is vanity."
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.320]   He's just saying, "Look, your life is so fleeting.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.100]   I know you're in a stage of life where you feel like you're going to live forever and
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.680]   you're always going to have your strength and you're always going to be able to run
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.080]   a marathon and you're always going to be able to do whatever you want to do whenever you
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   want to do it.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:33:00.440]   And that day is going to be so painful if you wait until that day where you can't function
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.240]   like you want to function and you wait until that day to finally find Jesus."
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.160]   He's saying, "Don't waste your youth.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.800]   There's never been a better time to walk with God.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.680]   Walk with God now when you still have strength in your hands to serve people.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.640]   Walk with God now while your legs still work well and you can go and you can be a messenger
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   to the roughly three billion people in the world that have never heard the name of Jesus.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.560]   Know Jesus now while you can still behold beautiful things.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   You can behold creation and your heart can well up with joy just beholding all that God
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.480]   has created.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:49.040]   Like while your vocal cords are still strong, worship Jesus now when you can sing at the
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.920]   top of your lungs."
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:34:00.360]   Today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.240]   And I just want to be clear with you.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:09.800]   I just want to speak to you to make sure you know this is why you exist.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.400]   You exist to know Jesus and to make him known.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.080]   That's what the point and purpose of your life is.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.680]   It all boils down to that.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:23.480]   That's why Paul says in Colossians 116, he says, "For by him," talking about Jesus, "all
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.720]   things were created," which is interesting because Solomon in the Old Testament says,
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.120]   "Remember your creator."
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.880]   Well, Paul says, "Well, do you know who was involved in creation?
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   Jesus."
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.160]   He says, "For by Jesus, all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.440]   whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   Jesus."
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:48.480]   And watch this, "All things were created for Jesus."
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.840]   You were created for Jesus.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.320]   The reason you exist is to know Jesus.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.000]   I'll explain it this way.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.440]   Some of you all might have heard this before.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.420]   I always have my iPhone with me on stage.
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.980]   Why does the iPhone exist?
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.240]   The iPhone exists to put the world at your fingertips.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:17.720]   You can see someone face to face and you can have a conversation with anyone in the world
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.640]   without actually being in person.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.040]   You can get a date without leaving your house.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.960]   Just one swipe could change your life.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.280]   The iPhone exists to put the world at your fingertips.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.520]   You can live like the iPhone exists for a different purpose, right?
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.960]   Like if the table's wobbly, you could jam your iPhone under there and be like, "Man,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   that works really well."
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.080]   Or you can flip it over on your coffee table and you're like, "Man, this is a great coaster.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.920]   I don't know if you've ever tried this, but it just works well as a coaster."
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.880]   You can use the iPhone for a different purpose, but it doesn't change the fact that the iPhone
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:00.560]   is most fully fulfilling the purpose for which it's been created when it is putting the world
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.720]   at your fingertips.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.560]   And the same is true for you.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.880]   You have been made to know Jesus.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.880]   That is why you exist.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.680]   And you can live as if you exist for a different purpose.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.200]   You can live as if you exist to be a millionaire by 30.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.100]   You can live as if you exist to get a ring on your finger.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:28.360]   You can live as if you exist to be the top person in your company or to run your own
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.360]   thing.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.960]   You can live as if you exist to complete an Ironman triathlon.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:39.360]   You can live like that's why you exist, but it doesn't change the fact that you will be
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:45.480]   most fully alive and most fully functioning when you fulfill the purpose for which you've
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:53.180]   been created, which is to know Jesus Christ intimately.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.180]   And so I'll just say this.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.280]   Do you want to know where regret is found?
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:06.280]   Regret is found in getting to 40 and still sitting in spiritual diapers because you've
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.740]   just never taken the time to grow up in your faith.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.880]   Because you want to run to everything else because you think that there's more life,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:19.480]   more joy, more satisfaction out there than there is with Jesus.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.720]   And so if I could tell 24-year-old Timothy Atteke something, I would just say, "Look,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:29.000]   today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus."
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.400]   The fourth thing that I would tell my younger self is this, is I would just say, "Look,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.500]   a good truth to live by is this.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.720]   Your view of God determines your response to God."
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.340]   Hopefully you've heard me say that multiple times before, but I say that because Solomon
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.280]   brings it up.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.440]   Your view of God determines your response to God.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:56.600]   That is the greatest single truth that I learned in my late 20s as a young adult.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:02.480]   I learned it right around the age of 29, and I wish that at 29 I could have gone back to
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.920]   my 24-year-old self and just said, "Look, your view of God will determine your response
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.120]   to God, and that truth will change everything."
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.720]   Solomon says right at the end of the book, skip down to verse 13, what does he say?
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.960]   He says, "The end of the matter, all has been heard."
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   Do you know what he's saying?
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.560]   He's saying, "Look, this is what it all boils down to."
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:31.520]   Solomon, the wisest guy in the world, the wealthiest guy in the world, the guy who had
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.920]   probably had more sex than anyone else in the world, he says, "Look, here's the end
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.040]   of the matter.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:45.560]   Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man."
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.880]   This is what life comes down to.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.720]   It comes down to fearing God and keeping His commandments.
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.280]   He says, "Fear God and keep His commandments."
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.880]   Fear God talks about your view of God.
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.660]   What he's saying is live with a right view of God.
[00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.120]   He says, "Keep His commandments."
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.440]   He's talking about your response to God, have the right response to God.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:12.840]   What I want you to learn at whatever age you're at right now is that the two go hand in hand.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.980]   Your view of God will actually determine your response to God.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.220]   If you have a big view of God, you're going to have a big response to God.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:24.200]   If you're sitting there right now and you feel like you're having a small response to
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.160]   God, you wake up in the morning, you don't want to spend time with God, you feel too
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.920]   busy for God, when you show up here you're not interested in worshiping Him, you know
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.120]   what the problem is?
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.520]   You're having a small response because you have a small view.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.440]   This is how all relationships work.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.920]   When you find a guy who's head over heels about a girl, like he'll watch any Nicholas
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.000]   Sparks movie with her and he's like, "It's got a good plot."
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "No, it doesn't."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.440]   Like, you know what's happened there?
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.920]   He's got such a big view of the girl that he has a big response to her.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:05.000]   But what happens when that view of a person changes?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.680]   You stop texting, you start ghosting.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.920]   Why?
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.920]   Your view determines your response.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:22.160]   You know what, for so much of my young adult life, I lived under the banner of this is
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.280]   what I should do spiritually.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.160]   I should read my Bible.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.920]   I should go to church.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.360]   I should pray.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.600]   Do you know why it was a bunch of shoulds?
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.720]   Do you want to know why it was a bunch of discipline?
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.200]   Not much delight.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:51.240]   Because I was operating, I was trying to have a big response with a small view.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.800]   And everything changed.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:41:00.440]   When I began to fight for the biggest view of God possible, it changed my response.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.760]   Solomon says, "Fear God, keep His commandments."
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.440]   That's what it all boils down to.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.360]   So my encouragement for you is fight for the biggest view of God possible every day.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.560]   And just watch what happens to your response.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.400]   And then the final thing that I would tell myself, my 24-year-old self, is this, never
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.040]   get over the gospel.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.760]   Never get over the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.720]   Look at what verse 14 says.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Solomon ends the whole book by saying, "For God will bring every deed into judgment with
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.160]   every secret thing, whether good or evil."
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.960]   And then the book ends, that's it.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.640]   He ends by saying, "God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.680]   good or evil."
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.360]   What a bad note to end on.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.040]   It's so unsettling.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.560]   Someday you're going to stand before God and everything you've ever thought, everything
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:01.000]   you've ever said, everything you've ever done is going to be revealed by God.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.980]   The reason I would tell my younger self, never get over the gospel, is because if you know
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:14.160]   Jesus Christ, then you don't have to fear that day that you stand before God.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.600]   Why?
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.640]   Because when you know Jesus Christ, when you understand what He's done for you on the cross,
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:25.160]   that His body was broken and His blood was shed on the cross to make payment for all
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:31.000]   of your sins, all of your imperfections, and when He rose from the dead, it was a demonstration
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.760]   that He had taken care of all of your failures.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.660]   When you know Jesus Christ in a personal way, do you know what happens is all of your failures
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.920]   are cleansed.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.220]   They are dealt with by Jesus.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:51.740]   So when you stand before God, the blood of Christ has washed you clean.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.540]   But not just that.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:43:00.300]   Like today, the reason I say never get over the gospel is because today, because of what
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.940]   Christ has done, and because of faith in Him, He's actually put His Spirit inside of you
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:10.020]   so that you can live a life pleasing to God.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:15.180]   And so when you stand before God, there's going to be plenty of things that are revealed
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:21.460]   that just shows how amazing and powerful the Spirit of God was working through you to make
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.300]   you more like Jesus.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:33.220]   And even now, in the moments when we fail, God's grace is sufficient.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:40.460]   So even when we fail, we can look to the cross and the empty tomb to know that Christ's death,
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:48.160]   Christ's burial, Christ's resurrection is enough, even for our failures today.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.020]   Never get over the gospel.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.500]   Never get over the gospel.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.340]   And some of you are sitting there saying, "I don't even have the chance to get over
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.140]   it because I've never truly understood it."
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:05.560]   And so I just say, if you are not a Christian and you are here tonight and you are understanding
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.980]   for the first time that when you stand before God, you don't just cross your fingers and
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.340]   hope for the best.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.640]   Either you will stand before God and you will have to answer for your sin, or you will stand
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:22.980]   before God and Jesus Christ will have already answered for it.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:28.100]   And so your hope is either in Jesus or you're going to cross your fingers and hope for the
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.100]   best.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.460]   And I promise you, the Scripture is clear.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.500]   Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.580]   No one comes to the Father except through me."
[00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:46.380]   And yet Jesus Christ's invitation to you tonight is to come, to give your life to Him.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.420]   And you can experience complete forgiveness for your sin tonight.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.780]   So I'll close just kind of where I started.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.160]   I just want you to think, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now, you're going to look back
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:04.080]   to where you are right now in 2023.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.460]   What if you could say, what if you could look back to this season of life and say, "I'm
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.900]   so glad that in 2023 God gave me a new heart.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:17.380]   In 2023 I cultivated my heart for the Lord.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.620]   So I followed my heart because it was a heart that was aligned with God."
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.300]   What if you could say, "I embraced where God had me and I'm so glad that I did because
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.180]   I didn't sit there in frustration.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:32.300]   I just said yes to where God had me in 2023."
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.620]   What if you could say, "That's when I really went for it.
[00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:40.340]   That's when I started wholeheartedly following Jesus and I'm so glad I did."
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.860]   What if you could say, "That's when I began fighting for the biggest view of God possible
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.580]   and it has changed my response to Him."
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.860]   And what if you could look back and say, "That's when I really began to appreciate the gospel,
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:59.620]   not just as my ticket into heaven, but as the way that heaven has been getting into
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:07.260]   me every day for 10, 15, 20 years."
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:13.860]   May we be a people who walk wisely, where joy is maximized and unnecessary pain is minimized.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.860]   Why?
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.540]   Because we know the King, Jesus Christ.
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:26.060]   Let's pray together.
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:29.180]   If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ, I don't
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:35.660]   want to miss an opportunity just to give you a chance to pray the way that we express faith
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.860]   to God.
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.900]   Romans 10, 9 says that if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.100]   in our heart that God raised Him from the dead, then you will be saved.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:53.580]   So I just encourage you now to just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.660]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.460]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.620]   Would you come into my life?
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.980]   Would you forgive me of my sin?
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:15.380]   Would you begin to lead me in a new life?"
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:18.780]   And for the rest of us, what's God saying to you tonight?
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.100]   Maybe you're sitting there and you're like, "Okay, this is it.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.660]   This is the day.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:28.960]   Today is finally the day that I'm going to start wholeheartedly following Jesus."
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:34.580]   Maybe there's desires, motivations, passions that you know are not aligned with the Lord
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:40.220]   that you just need to confess.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.500]   Maybe your view of God has spawned, you just want to say, "God, would you expand my view
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.500]   of you tonight?"
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.740]   Or maybe you just want to say, "God, thank you for the good news of the gospel, that
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:51.900]   it's enough."
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.740]   Do business with the Lord now.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.300]   We love you, Lord.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.820]   We thank you for all you've done.
[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.780]   respond to you now.
