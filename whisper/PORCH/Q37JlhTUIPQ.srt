1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,880
 In preparing the message,

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,040
 we're always thinking through the opening story, right?

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,320
 And so my team asked me,

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,680
 we have a sermon prep team,

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,080
 as we put together these messages,

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,920
 and they said,

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,920
 "Well, do you have a story of somebody

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
 "doing something really stupid when they were drunk?"

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,460
 (congregation laughing)

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,960
 And like all of these slides

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,640
 start flashing through my head, you know?

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,060
 I was like, the better question,

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,360
 do I have a story of anybody doing something not stupid

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,200
 when they were drunk?

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,240
 Like that would be much more difficult to find,

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,020
 but as you know, if you've been running with us,

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,040
 I wasn't a follower of Christ in college,

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
 and so that really looked like every weekend

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,640
 watching somebody do something ridiculously stupid

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,800
 when they were drunk.

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,360
 Sometimes it was me,

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,140
 but the memories that flashed through my head,

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,800
 I mean, I remember one particular night,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,240
 a really close friend of mine had too much to drink.

26
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,560
 I mean, have you ever seen someone

27
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,640
 who has had too much to drink?

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,800
 I mean, too much.

29
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,480
 Like, a whole 'nother level too much,

30
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,840
 like, okay, like cannot control themselves,

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,960
 out of control, drunk.

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
 And so it starts with kind of the tragedy,

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,680
 tragic events of that night.

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,600
 Start with him wanting to go to his truck to drive,

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,720
 and I'm like, you cannot do,

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,360
 I just remember trying to reason with a drunk man,

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,080
 like, you cannot do this.

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,480
 Give me your keys, you know?

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,840
 And you can't drive.

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,600
 If you drive, there's going to be casualties.

41
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,720
 This will not be good.

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,400
 And he's like, no, I can't, I can't, I'm good, man.

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,960
 You know, and you're like, no, you can't even talk,

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,920
 you can't even stand, much less drive down the road.

45
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,240
 Give me your keys.

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,400
 Then it progresses to he wanted to fight me, right?

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,520
 And I'm just like, I'm not into that.

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,200
 Like, you know, I'm not gonna drive.

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
 Then he wanted to fight.

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,360
 Then he wanted to jump on the top of a Porsche,

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,080
 like, just thought it was a good idea,

52
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,560
 it was a nice, beautiful Porsche.

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,120
 And it's like, I think I can stand on the hood.

54
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,200
 No, bro, that's not a good idea, man.

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,320
 Let's not do that.

56
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,320
 And then it progressed to he was gonna walk across 35.

57
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,160
 And so there's I-35 there in Waco.

58
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,600
 It's like traffic, just cars flying by, okay,

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
 eight lanes right there.

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
 And he's like, no, I think I can make it across.

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
 It's like Frogger, but live.

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,960
 And I'm like, buddy, you're not gonna do this.

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,760
 And just trying to stop him and trying to reason

64
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,000
 with a drunk person is never a good idea

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
 because when you're under the influence,

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,760
 you have this force kind of pulling you

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,560
 in another direction, usually a very ignorant direction.

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,640
 No one ever is like, dude, I did brain surgery last night.

69
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,800
 Yeah, I was so drunk.

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
 You know, it's never good, right?

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,720
 Like, yep, found the cure for cancer.

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,840
 I was wasted.

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,360
 It's always, somebody, it's always an excuse.

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,080
 It's like, dude, did you know you texted her?

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,120
 It's like, yeah, I was drunk.

76
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
 You know, did you know you said that?

77
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,160
 Yeah, I was drunk.

78
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,640
 It's like an excuse for doing something incredibly stupid.

79
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,240
 I was under the influence.

80
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,200
 Well, tonight we're talking about being under an influence

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,280
 of something else, this idea of love.

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,000
 Now, it operates really similarly.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,880
 Some of you will do some very, very stupid things

84
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,240
 when you're under the influence of love.

85
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,840
 I have done some very stupid things

86
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
 under the influence of love.

87
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,840
 It is this force that is pulling us

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
 sometimes against our will in a direction

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,680
 we do not wanna go because of our feelings

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,640
 and emotions and our thoughts and these urges

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,120
 that we cannot bring under our control.

92
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,360
 In fact, they bring us under their control.

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,760
 We're actually following them.

94
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,320
 And so had my friend gotten in a car

95
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,760
 and gotten stopped by the police,

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,240
 he would have gotten a DUI.

97
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,760
 That's driving under the influence.

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,400
 Tonight, as we continue our series, Lyrics and Lies,

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,920
 I wanna talk about dating under the influence,

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,520
 not the influence of alcohol,

101
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,960
 but the influence of love, feelings, emotions,

102
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,280
 sexual urges, whatever you wanna put there,

103
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,760
 whatever that is for you, dating under the influence

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,440
 where you are no longer in control

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,200
 because that's what drunk means.

106
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,640
 Drunk, by Webster's definition, is loss of control

107
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,200
 of one's faculties or behavior.

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,680
 Simply put, you are no longer in control.

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,360
 And as I've already stated, it's never a good thing.

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,440
 No one is like, yeah, solved global warming, I was drunk.

111
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
 It's always something bad happens whenever you are drunk,

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
 yet some of us actually pursue that,

113
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,440
 and many of us pursue that reality,

114
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,000
 that idea in relationships.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,840
 We wanna be out of control to our feelings.

116
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,480
 The world actually tells you that's a good thing.

117
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,480
 I'm telling you, that's not a good thing.

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,040
 It's not a wise thing.

119
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,800
 It's not a God-honoring thing.

120
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,920
 It is a going to hurt you kind of thing.

121
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,440
 And so we're looking at Beyonce's drunk in love,

122
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,720
 and I know people love Beyonce, all right?

123
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,560
 There's many people, girls love Beyonce.

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,680
 She might make you feel sexy,

125
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,720
 or there's just something in you that can relate to her,

126
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,160
 or maybe you love that she's this empowered woman

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,440
 and she's married to Jay-Z and they have this

128
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,440
 kind of crazy, you know, rock star relationship.

129
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,960
 But this song is a tragedy.

130
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,240
 In fact, it's the only one I will not read you the lyrics to.

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,040
 Too far, too far.

132
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,320
 It is not good for our hearts,

133
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,840
 and I know I sound like your parents,

134
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,520
 but give me a shot as I open the scriptures

135
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,680
 from the one who created the heavens and the earth,

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,920
 and who loves you and has a plan for you,

137
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,400
 a plan to prosper you, a plan to do incredible things

138
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
 for you, and what he says from the word this evening.

139
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,880
 So I know we live in a sexual charged culture,

140
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,040
 but the creator says that there is a sin

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,400
 that is different from all other kinds of sin.

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,160
 There is a sin that is against your own body,

143
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
 1 Corinthians 6:18.

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
 There's this one sin that is unique.

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,600
 And so if I'm the enemy, if I'm Satan,

146
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
 then I want to take out humanity,

147
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,520
 I want to kill you under some false pretense

148
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,040
 that I'm gonna give you life, but actually bring you death.

149
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,840
 What am I gonna go after?

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,200
 I'm gonna go after sex.

151
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
 I'm gonna go after sex,

152
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,080
 and I'm going to make you inoculated to it

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,240
 so that it's everywhere,

154
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,560
 so you no longer have these boundaries,

155
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,320
 because the culture for you to put any kind of boundaries

156
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,240
 around it, the culture might call you legalistic,

157
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,160
 or prude, or stupid, or foolish, or crazy,

158
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,600
 yet they're continually running off a cliff into divorce,

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,400
 into tragedy, into disease, into HIV, into abortions,

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
 into unwanted children,

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 into emotional desperation and disaster.

162
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,240
 And they're saying, hey, this is the way, follow us.

163
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,920
 Let me ask you a question.

164
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,440
 If you were God, if you were the creator

165
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,840
 of the heavens and the earth, where would you put sex?

166
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,720
 Would you say, like you're writing the Bible,

167
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,400
 hey, it's fine between two consenting adults.

168
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,960
 Is that where you'd put it?

169
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,760
 Hey, it's fine as long as both people agree to it.

170
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,800
 Hey, it's fine in any regards.

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,960
 Where would you put it?

172
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,240
 As you consider disease, death, abortions,

173
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 unwanted children, the emotional attachment that occurs

174
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,680
 and then breaks, the rewiring, sex trafficking,

175
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
 sex for profit, where would you put it?

176
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
 Where would you make it available to those you love?

177
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,880
 So as we move through this idea of dating

178
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,360
 under the influence, talking about being drunk in love,

179
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,720
 as Beyonce puts it, I thought I'd start with a story

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
 from the Bible, from the scriptures.

181
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,760
 It's a historical account, it's a true story.

182
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,200
 David, you guys know of David, David and Goliath, okay?

183
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
 David fought the giant or David and Bathsheba.

184
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,960
 Usually it's one of those two.

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,360
 Well, today we're not talking about giants.

186
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,880
 And so David is the king of a kingdom,

187
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,280
 a very powerful kingdom, it's God's kingdom.

188
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,560
 God has pointed David king by a really unsuspecting path.

189
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,640
 Okay, that means he wasn't the son of the king.

190
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,200
 He kind of come up, he was just, he came up,

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,480
 he was just a shepherd boy.

192
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,760
 God appoints him as king.

193
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,960
 David loves God, the scripture says he's a man

194
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
 after God's own heart.

195
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,520
 And one day his kingdom, his people are at war.

196
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,120
 Now anytime the king's armies are at war,

197
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,280
 the king would go with them.

198
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,000
 But this time in the scripture, in 2 Samuel 11,

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,720
 it goes out of its way to tell you that David stayed back.

200
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,200
 David was at home, okay?

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
 And so David did not go to war with his armies,

202
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,560
 he stayed back, and it says that he was walking

203
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,440
 along the rooftops.

204
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,920
 Now as he's walking along the rooftops,

205
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,040
 he's probably bored, his armies are in a foreign land,

206
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,720
 fighting, you know, a war, and he's at home,

207
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,720
 left to his own devices, he sees a babe named Bathsheba.

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,220
 She's bathing, she is cleansing herself

209
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,480
 after her menstrual cycle is actually what is going on.

210
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,120
 And so he sees her bathing and he's attracted to her

211
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
 and he says, hey, who is that?

212
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,320
 That's Eliam's wife, I mean, that's Eliam's daughter.

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
 Uriah's wife, the Hittite.

214
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,840
 To which David should say, oh, one of my mighty men's wives?

215
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,960
 One of the guys who's in a foreign land

216
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,600
 fighting a battle for me right now?

217
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,740
 Well, will you send her some flowers and tell her

218
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,240
 thank you for staying back while your husband

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
 does the work of the kingdom?

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,460
 We're so grateful for you.

221
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,080
 How different would the story be?

222
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,240
 What you're going to hear right now

223
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,040
 is one of the most catastrophic sins

224
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,260
 of all the scriptures, in fact.

225
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,260
 It's been described as the single most catastrophic sin,

226
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,900
 most disastrous sin in all of the Bible.

227
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:40,440
 Instead of saying thank her, he says, bring her to me.

228
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,060
 And David takes Uriah's wife and he sleeps with her.

229
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,260
 Now, Uriah was one of David's mighty men,

230
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,960
 so was Bathsheba's dad, Eliam,

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,420
 and so Uriah and Eliam are at war together.

232
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,580
 This is a match made in heaven, Uriah and Bathsheba,

233
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,460
 that they were both fighting in David's army.

234
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,740
 Hey, bro, why don't you date my daughter?

235
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
 Why don't you marry her?

236
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,260
 This was that kind of wedding.

237
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,220
 Like, this was a Jay-Z and Beyonce

238
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,860
 kind of relationship, if you will.

239
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,380
 Everybody's watching on.

240
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,620
 She's really beautiful.

241
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,980
 Women want to be her.

242
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:20,740
 And so, this is what David comes in between

243
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,380
 and says, she's going to be mine.

244
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,620
 I'll take her as my own.

245
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,300
 What does it mean that they were David's mighty men?

246
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,140
 When he was running from Saul,

247
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,780
 from King Saul was after him,

248
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,920
 these men risked their lives to come and rescue him,

249
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,760
 to come and find him.

250
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,580
 That's who this is.

251
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,820
 That's what the depth of this betrayal.

252
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,860
 Why did he do it?

253
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,260
 'Cause he was drunk in love.

254
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,500
 'Cause he was drunk in love.

255
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,340
 He sleeps with her.

256
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,180
 When he wakes up the next morning, he sends her away.

257
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,020
 Why?

258
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,020
 Because shame always breaks intimacy.

259
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,060
 You ever had one of those moments?

260
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,100
 Like, what did I just do?

261
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,040
 That's what Beyonce says.

262
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,260
 How did we get here on the kitchen floor?

263
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,460
 How did this happen, she says.

264
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,500
 That's what David says.

265
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,860
 Wakes up, what am I?

266
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,700
 What did I do?

267
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,340
 Go, get away from me.

268
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,260
 Get out of here.

269
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,300
 Doesn't talk to her.

270
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,220
 You ever been there?

271
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,580
 Oh, well, who are you?

272
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,660
 What did we do?

273
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,420
 She calls him, maybe texts him.

274
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,260
 Sends a letter.

275
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,540
 Says, hey, I'm pregnant.

276
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,380
 Bro.

277
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,340
 David, being a schemer, says,

278
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,300
 hey, bring Uriah back from battle.

279
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,540
 Now, if you're Uriah, you're like,

280
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,100
 what am I, why are you bringing me back here?

281
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,900
 What do you want me to do, King?

282
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,220
 Now, David, being a schemer, is like,

283
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,780
 hey, sleep with your wife

284
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,260
 so that you'll think it's actually your kid.

285
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,500
 How awful is that?

286
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,900
 Do you know what Uriah says?

287
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,940
 I can't do, I'm not gonna go home, King.

288
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,660
 David says, hey, go ahead, go home,

289
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,860
 be with your wife.

290
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,420
 Uriah says, no, my men are at battle.

291
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,540
 They're sleeping in tents.

292
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,500
 I will sleep outside on the palace floor,

293
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,860
 on the palace steps.

294
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,580
 Uriah's a faithful dude.

295
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,780
 Faithful man.

296
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,580
 You know what David does?

297
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
 David says, all right, come here.

298
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,980
 He gets him drunk, thinking that if he can bring him

299
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,700
 under the influence, that he will then go

300
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
 and sleep with his wife.

301
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,380
 But Uriah was faithful.

302
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,300
 Even under the influence, he slept on the palace steps.

303
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
 So David has to increase his scheme.

304
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,100
 Calls his first commander, Joab, and says,

305
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,060
 hey, I want you to put Uriah on the front lines

306
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,460
 where the battle is the fiercest

307
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,020
 so that he would be struck by the enemy and killed.

308
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,060
 Wow.

309
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,820
 Uriah goes back to battle.

310
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,340
 The plan is executed exactly as he thought it up.

311
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,780
 Uriah is struck down by the enemy.

312
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,180
 He is killed.

313
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,220
 God sends Nathan, the friend and prophet to David

314
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,740
 and says, you have done an awful thing,

315
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,700
 and because you have done this, okay,

316
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
 the sword is going to come to your house.

317
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,220
 There is going to be a war in your household,

318
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,780
 and the son that you have now created

319
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,580
 through Bathsheba will die.

320
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,060
 David's son dies, and disaster strikes,

321
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,820
 and the kingdom falls apart.

322
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,220
 And Nathan says specifically,

323
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,220
 someone very close to you is going to sleep with your wives.

324
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,860
 And David's son, Absalom,

325
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,780
 who saw how his father treated women,

326
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,780
 comes and sleeps with his wives on the roof of the palace.

327
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,660
 God says what you have done in quiet or in private,

328
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,060
 disaster will come to you in broad daylight.

329
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,020
 And David's son sleeps with his wives

330
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,420
 on the top of the palace.

331
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,060
 How corrupt and wicked is that?

332
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,300
 The legacy of this sin that comes from being drunk in love

333
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,940
 and making decisions out of emotions,

334
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,340
 following the monster inside of you

335
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,260
 if you were here a few weeks ago.

336
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,780
 David has another son.

337
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,460
 That son's name is Solomon.

338
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,880
 He was known as the wisest man in all the world

339
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,820
 other than Jesus.

340
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,700
 He wrote a book that we know as the book of wisdom

341
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,620
 called the Proverbs.

342
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,180
 And that will be in Proverbs five.

343
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,020
 Turn with me.

344
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,620
 Solomon saw this all go down.

345
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,540
 He saw how his dad responded in adultery.

346
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,460
 He knew who his father was, the wives, plural, that he had.

347
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,740
 And he writes this.

348
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,460
 He says, "Drink water from your own cistern."

349
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,000
 Drunk in love starts, I've been drinking.

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,420
 I've been drinking.

351
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,140
 "Drink water from your own cistern,

352
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,220
 "running water from your own well.

353
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,920
 "Should your springs overflow in the streets,

354
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,680
 "your streams of water in the public squares,

355
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,340
 "let them be yours alone,

356
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,520
 "never to be shared with strangers."

357
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,500
 It's talking about sex, love, emotion,

358
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,400
 these feelings that we have and the acts that go with them.

359
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,000
 "May your fountain be blessed

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,600
 "and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth,

361
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,580
 "a loving doe, a graceful deer.

362
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,100
 "May her breasts satisfy you always.

363
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,100
 "May you ever or forever be drunk with her love."

364
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,820
 Intoxicated with her love.

365
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,620
 The word for intoxicated right there,

366
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,260
 it has two meanings that actually contrast each other

367
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,620
 and you can understand why they fit together.

368
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,740
 It means either captivated or led astray.

369
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,940
 Captivated or led astray.

370
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,140
 You're gonna see both meanings in this passage.

371
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,740
 The first one is captivated.

372
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,300
 May you be captivated.

373
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,700
 See also committed to her in love.

374
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
 May you be stuck with her in love,

375
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,580
 one person for a lifetime.

376
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,420
 For this is your well, this is your provision,

377
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,840
 this is your cistern.

378
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,660
 My first point is a question or really a revelation,

379
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,420
 love, where to drink.

380
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,740
 So where should we drink of love?

381
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,980
 Verse 15, "Drink water from your own cistern,

382
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,500
 "running water from your own well."

383
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,980
 And so cisterns and wells control water.

384
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,100
 They give it boundaries, they hold it in place.

385
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,020
 They keep it where it should be kept.

386
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,240
 But it says, "Do not let your water run out

387
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
 "into the streets.

388
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,300
 "If it is broken, it can go anywhere."

389
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,620
 That you would follow that desire wherever it would lead.

390
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,180
 Just like a flowing water down the streets,

391
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,660
 nothing to hold it, nothing to contain it.

392
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,760
 Wherever it would go, you would follow it.

393
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,580
 And for some of you, this has happened.

394
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,860
 You understand what it's like to give yourself

395
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,580
 to someone in the act of sex,

396
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,220
 the sacred act of which God created,

397
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,520
 maybe as a Christian or as a non-Christian

398
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,860
 before you knew Christ.

399
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,340
 And then all of the sudden, it's devalued.

400
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,420
 Maybe the first time was difficult

401
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,820
 and it was like, I'll never do that again.

402
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,780
 And then the second time and the third time

403
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,340
 and the fourth time, it's easier.

404
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,860
 And then all of the sudden, it's a weakened sport.

405
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,380
 And maybe it's a way that you would feel love

406
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,340
 and receive love.

407
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,020
 Or, well, I loved him and then I loved him.

408
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,920
 I loved her, I loved her.

409
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
 And maybe the act isn't even with a person,

410
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:13,320
 but by yourself, with an image or a video

411
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,160
 that we would give ourselves,

412
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,120
 that we would take this act that God created

413
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,040
 for a very specific purpose,

414
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
 and we would enjoy it for our own fleeting pleasure

415
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,000
 so that we might wake up and say, what happened?

416
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,680
 What did I do?

417
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,280
 What did I do?

418
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,080
 So you are a place, all of you are a place

419
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,500
 for one person to drink from.

420
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,760
 That person is the person that you would be married to,

421
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,680
 not will be married to, but are married to.

422
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,180
 You're reserved for them.

423
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,840
 Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.

424
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,240
 There is one well from which you can drink,

425
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,120
 and that is your one solution for sexual release.

426
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,240
 In 1 Corinthians 7, verse nine, it's described like this.

427
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,520
 But if they burn with passion, let them marry.

428
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,320
 If they burn with passion, let them masturbate.

429
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,160
 If they burn with passion, let them cohabitate.

430
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,920
 If they burn with passion, let them experiment,

431
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,560
 make sure everything fits.

432
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,580
 'Cause as long as they're going to get married, no.

433
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,360
 The scripture says, if they burn with passion,

434
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 if they're drunk in love, they should get married.

435
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,960
 For it is better to be married

436
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,560
 than to be given to passion and feelings and emotions

437
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,800
 and do foolish things outside of marriage.

438
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,520
 Plainly, as it can say.

439
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:54,800
 So the visual here is, and I hate saying this

440
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
 'cause I'm not trying to instill shame.

441
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,000
 If you know my story, I'm a recovering sex addict.

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,040
 It's a huge, enormous part of my story.

443
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,360
 I'm a person who has been shared.

444
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,600
 You know, I've been around.

445
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,320
 The picture, the image that he gives us

446
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,000
 is you have one place to drink from.

447
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,880
 And that you shouldn't share that with a stranger.

448
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 We go to this park all the time on the weekends

449
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,440
 with my kids, and in the middle of this park,

450
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,120
 it's a public park, and it's an old park.

451
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,280
 And in the middle of it is a water fountain.

452
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,480
 And I walk by there, and I always think the same thing.

453
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,440
 Who drinks from that?

454
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,640
 Because everyone drinks from it,

455
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,720
 therefore no one should drink from it, right?

456
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
 And some of you here, you're like,

457
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,640
 yeah, I wouldn't drink after a stranger.

458
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,360
 I wouldn't drink after someone,

459
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,700
 like someone put their mouth on a, I don't.

460
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,760
 But yet you would lie with one.

461
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,640
 You would make out with one.

462
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,320
 You would be with one, and then another one,

463
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,520
 and then another one.

464
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,760
 I don't say that to instill shame on you at all.

465
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,800
 I'm telling you, Monica, Mary, my wife,

466
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,700
 Mary, the guide.

467
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,880
 That's strangers, you know?

468
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
 That's a part of my past.

469
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,720
 You've gotta recover from that.

470
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,760
 I'm not saying right now, hey, be owned by that,

471
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,320
 feel guilty for that, but I am saying,

472
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,800
 hey, if that's a part of your story,

473
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,960
 it's a much bigger deal than you probably thought,

474
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,080
 'cause it's a much bigger deal

475
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,560
 than the world presents to you.

476
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,440
 And you must pursue a path of recovery in the midst of that.

477
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,040
 It begins now.

478
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,160
 Stop hiding it, stop sweeping it under the rug,

479
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,600
 stop thinking it's not a big deal.

480
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,120
 It's a big deal.

481
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,960
 But God's grace is a bigger deal.

482
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,560
 He says, "May your fountain be blessed,

483
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,120
 "and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth."

484
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,640
 Blessed how?

485
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,440
 And will the Lord give you an amazing sex life

486
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,300
 if you wait for marriage?

487
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,680
 I don't know.

488
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,560
 I have no idea, man.

489
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,160
 I've met people, I've counseled people

490
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,960
 from the Scriptures who waited 'til they were married

491
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,200
 and they can't have sex,

492
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 either because of a physical issue or a mental block.

493
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
 They're unable to have sex.

494
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,960
 And some of them have the maturity to say,

495
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,240
 you know what, this wasn't promised to me.

496
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
 Others of them are mad at God.

497
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 They're like, hey, how dare you?

498
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,280
 I waited.

499
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
 You know, they've struck this deal with God.

500
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,520
 There was an article that went around.

501
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,360
 I don't know if you read it.

502
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
 It was written by Samantha Pugsley,

503
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,840
 and it titled, "I waited until my wedding night

504
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,440
 "to lose my virginity, and I wish I hadn't."

505
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,880
 And here's the problem.

506
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,800
 She waited because she made a deal with God

507
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,880
 that God never made.

508
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,200
 God, if I do, then you will.

509
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
 He didn't strike that deal.

510
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,000
 He said, hey, if you follow me and know me

511
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,080
 and seek me and trust in my Son as a revision for your sins,

512
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,760
 I'm gonna give you heaven, which is much better than sex,

513
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,560
 forever and ever and ever and ever.

514
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
 You can be with me in my kingdom.

515
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,760
 Can you have sex?

516
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,720
 Probably.

517
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,480
 Will it be amazing?

518
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,840
 You'll have to work at it.

519
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,320
 It's true.

520
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 It's true.

521
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,160
 It's not, I know, I know that most of us in the room

522
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,680
 are single, and you think the honeymoon's gonna be like,

523
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,520
 (imitates rocket launching)

524
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,800
 rockets going off and birds singing.

525
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,520
 Beyonce and Jay-Z, something crazy.

526
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,440
 I don't know.

527
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,080
 Don't picture it.

528
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,400
 (congregation laughing)

529
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,720
 Today, Samantha Pugsley is a bisexual in an open marriage

530
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,080
 giving you relationship advice.

531
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,040
 Some of you read that and thought, hmm,

532
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,920
 maybe she's right, she's not right.

533
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
 God's right.

534
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,040
 (congregation laughing)

535
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
 I'm just telling you.

536
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:02,560
 We were meant to be content with one spouse for a lifetime,

537
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,400
 so what happened?

538
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,360
 He says, verse 20, "Why my son be intoxicated

539
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
 "with another man's wife?"

540
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
 I want you to read that as,

541
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
 "Why be drunk in love with anyone

542
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,200
 "except the one you are married to?"

543
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,960
 Why be intoxicated with another man's wife?

544
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,960
 Why be intoxicated with anyone you are not married to

545
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,760
 that's not your wife?

546
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,720
 If they're not your wife, they're another man's wife.

547
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
 But they will be my wife.

548
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,600
 You don't know what will happen tomorrow, James says.

549
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,760
 Oh, you know better than God.

550
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,920
 Let's play that game.

551
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,680
 Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?

552
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,640
 For your ways are in full view of the Lord,

553
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,240
 and he examines all your paths.

554
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,280
 For your ways are in full view of the Lord.

555
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,800
 Ray Rice didn't know that.

556
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:03,080
 For your ways are in full view of the Lord,

557
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,200
 and he examines all your paths.

558
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
 My second point is, love where not to drink.

559
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,920
 Where not to drink from anyone you are not married to.

560
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,440
 Okay, pastor, that's cute, man.

561
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,120
 You're up there, know the Bible.

562
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,360
 Don't be drunk in love with anyone I'm not married to.

563
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,240
 That's cool.

564
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,840
 I know that some of you are so brainwashed

565
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,120
 by culture, I was too, by the way.

566
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,440
 I get it, like there is a strong current today

567
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,680
 with sexually charged culture.

568
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,960
 Satan's winning the battle on sex, okay,

569
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,520
 just in case you're wondering,

570
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,280
 and you're a pawn in his game,

571
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,960
 and you're one of the methods by which he's winning,

572
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,440
 'cause he's won over your heart and your mind,

573
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,760
 and you haven't renewed it, as the scripture says,

574
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,680
 and you have not allowed the spirit

575
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,280
 to guard your hearts and your minds,

576
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,760
 and so you are entertained by the very things

577
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,560
 Jesus died for.

578
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,840
 You are entertained by it, and he has won you over,

579
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
 and he says this is the way, he says,

580
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,000
 date as the world dates, be intoxicated by love,

581
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,120
 follow your feelings and emotions,

582
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,760
 all the way to divorce court over and over again,

583
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
 all the way to sadness and despair and depression,

584
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,400
 and God says, my sweet, sweet little girl,

585
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,880
 I love you, and I've got a better plan for you than that.

586
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,360
 Young man, I know you, and I know there's a war

587
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,960
 inside your body, but will you yield to my spirit

588
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,760
 over your own will, over your flesh?

589
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,120
 Will you listen to me?

590
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,120
 What happened, we're so far from where we should be, guys.

591
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,360
 One thing that happened in our culture

592
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,320
 is the pursuit of variety from a very early age.

593
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,360
 I mean, even the way that you asked so and so

594
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,240
 to go around with you in the sixth grade,

595
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,360
 or will you go with me, whatever that was for you,

596
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,000
 however you said it, check yes or no, I don't know.

597
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,600
 We start dating really young,

598
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,560
 and we start exploring the opposite sex

599
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,080
 at a very young age, and you go back to your old life,

600
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,280
 your first kiss in your mind, some of you,

601
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,240
 if that's a part of your story,

602
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
 and it probably happened way before it should have.

603
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,120
 There's an explosion of hormones, an explosion of emotion,

604
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,160
 and now you're on a track where you are now addicted

605
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,180
 to attention from the opposite sex,

606
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,840
 constantly needing more from them, finding identity in it.

607
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,720
 If you are in a happy relationship,

608
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,040
 all is well in your world.

609
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,840
 If you are in a bad relationship,

610
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,200
 all is terrible in your world.

611
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,040
 If you're not in a relationship,

612
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,240
 all is despairing in your world.

613
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,280
 You've been left out.

614
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
 God has forgotten you.

615
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,360
 He has forsaken you.

616
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,080
 He doesn't love you, is the lies of the enemy.

617
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,240
 And he says, no, my child, I have not forsaken you,

618
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,260
 I have not forgotten you, and I love you more

619
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,600
 than you could ever comprehend.

620
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,000
 In fact, I'm waiting on you.

621
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,920
 I'm waiting to be ultimate to you.

622
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,760
 I am pursuing you and wooing you

623
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,200
 and trying to win back your heart from the world.

624
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,840
 Trying to win back your heart from boys,

625
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,340
 trying to win back your heart from porn,

626
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,400
 trying to win back your heart from the addiction

627
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,440
 of relationships since the fifth grade,

628
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,720
 the roller coaster that you've been on.

629
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,360
 And so we've been addicted to variety.

630
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,080
 That's what addiction to pornography is,

631
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,380
 is certainly not an addiction to sex.

632
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,380
 Porn is college for sex with multiple people.

633
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,080
 Do you understand that?

634
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
 Porn, from the very first interaction of it,

635
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,440
 is training your brain not to be attracted to one person,

636
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,040
 also known as monogamy, but to be attracted to many people,

637
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,000
 a variety of people at the same time.

638
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,280
 In fact, the porn addict, by scientific happenings,

639
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,120
 cannot be attracted to one person.

640
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,120
 The porn addict, it is impossible in the moment

641
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,080
 and in that addiction to be attracted to one person.

642
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,960
 They have trained and wired their brain not to,

643
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,920
 but before you're like, yeah, well, I'm not a porn,

644
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,360
 so has the fantasy addict, so has the one who engages

645
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,760
 and loves "Fifty Shades of Grey" or romance novels

646
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,000
 or any kind of fantasy of that sort.

647
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,840
 So has the one who is constantly dating boys

648
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,920
 in her mind she's never met on Facebook.

649
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,040
 You have also trained and wired your brain for variety,

650
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,600
 a fantasy that never existed,

651
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 a standard that no one will ever meet for you.

652
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,120
 Prince Charming will never show up.

653
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,960
 Why?

654
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,880
 He doesn't exist as you have created him up here.

655
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,760
 That's why.

656
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,800
 You are pursuing something unreal.

657
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,500
 What do I do, JP?

658
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,800
 Get help now, tonight.

659
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,880
 You say, he's talking about me, I need help.

660
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
 He's talking to me, I need help.

661
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,240
 And you start a path to recovery tonight

662
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,080
 because you will not be satisfied by one person.

663
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,960
 That's what this proverb is saying.

664
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,340
 See, God's design is for one person for life,

665
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,000
 that you would be forever pleased by her.

666
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,280
 I want you to know that I don't believe

667
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,680
 that Beyonce and Jay-Z are describing

668
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,800
 that kind of being drunk in love,

669
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,760
 that the intoxication, that is a captivation for a lifetime.

670
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,720
 They're actually selling you a lie.

671
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,360
 I'm well aware that they're married,

672
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,040
 but they are selling you a lie.

673
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,160
 They are drunk in lust.

674
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,720
 Okay, if you read the words of the song,

675
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,760
 I don't encourage you to.

676
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
 It is very, very apparent.

677
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,720
 And so secondly, I want you to know

678
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,960
 that I know that many pastors have stood before you

679
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,440
 and told you not to have sex,

680
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
 but very few have explained why.

681
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,800
 Simply saying because the Bible has says so,

682
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,320
 which is a good enough reason,

683
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,240
 but I'm telling you there's a reason the Bible says so,

684
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,440
 because God loves you.

685
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,740
 And if you enjoy something out of its intentions,

686
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,580
 too often you cannot enjoy it as it was intended.

687
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,960
 Let me say that again.

688
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,580
 If you have sex outside of marriage,

689
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,420
 you may not be able to enjoy sex inside of marriage,

690
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,700
 because the type of sex you tasted,

691
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,940
 the type of sex you've grown addicted to

692
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,660
 is that which is outside of marriage.

693
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,500
 And so how do you continue to have that high, that thrill?

694
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,380
 You have to continually going outside your marriage.

695
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,820
 Why are adultery rates skyrocketing?

696
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,260
 This is why.

697
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,140
 If you have climbed the fence to get something,

698
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,900
 you will not be able to go through the gate.

699
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,420
 If you have eaten stolen food and you like the taste of it,

700
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,020
 you will not like the taste when it's handed to you.

701
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,000
 Do you hear me?

702
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,380
 God loves you.

703
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,180
 He has a plan for you.

704
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,180
 He's not trying to rip you off.

705
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,540
 He's trying to give you life.

706
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,020
 He says, "You don't understand that I created this act."

707
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,100
 He's the inventor of sex.

708
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,940
 He made the ports.

709
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,100
 He made 'em work the way they do.

710
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,940
 I'll get awkward if you want me to.

711
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,140
 (congregation laughing)

712
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,620
 He put the nerve endings where he did.

713
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,100
 He made it feel the way he did in her and in him.

714
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,740
 It's a very incredible thing

715
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,300
 that it would create life inside of a woman.

716
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,900
 Life would be created through this act,

717
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,180
 and God made it good.

718
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,700
 He didn't just make it good, he made it feel good.

719
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,700
 Satan says, "Hey, why don't you take the pleasure

720
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,060
 "for yourself without all of the purpose?"

721
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,280
 Let me say that again.

722
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,860
 Satan says, "Why don't you take the pleasure

723
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,700
 "for yourself without the purpose

724
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,340
 "so that you might enjoy it for yourself?

725
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,980
 "Climb in, climb over the fence, steal some of this food,

726
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,660
 "for you know better than God."

727
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:49,580
 You cannot replicate that kind of sex in marriage.

728
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,220
 There's an unsafeness to it.

729
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,260
 To it that exists only outside of marriage.

730
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,380
 See, sex inside of marriage is safe sex.

731
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,140
 It's safeguarded that a man would care for you,

732
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,580
 not beat you or hit you or hurt you,

733
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,540
 but be gentle to you and you to him, and it's safe.

734
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,860
 And if you've grown an addiction to unsafe sex,

735
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,980
 then you try to bring unsafe sex in the marriage.

736
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,540
 And I want you to know, as lovingly as I can,

737
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,700
 that's what Beyonce and Jay-Z have tried to do here.

738
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,060
 They have shown you a picture of unsafe sex

739
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,220
 with references to two men

740
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,260
 who were notorious spouse abusers,

741
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,460
 and one man who was a convicted rapist.

742
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,420
 All of those references are in this song,

743
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,340
 saying this is what being drunk in love looks like.

744
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,340
 No, man.

745
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,420
 No, sir.

746
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,380
 Some of you didn't even know that,

747
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,700
 and you've been feeding your heart.

748
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,980
 That lie.

749
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,500
 Telling your heart, this is what I want.

750
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,060
 I want it like Beyonce.

751
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,380
 And you didn't even know.

752
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,580
 Satan's at work in that, man.

753
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,020
 It's counterfeit sex.

754
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:11,900
 Some of us are addicted to counterfeit sex.

755
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,020
 Got my hair cut this week, in case you didn't notice.

756
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,940
 And the girl that was, I walked in, it was empty,

757
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,420
 and she was reading a book, and she puts away her book,

758
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,540
 and then she starts cutting my hair,

759
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,780
 and then it got full, like people started walking in.

760
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,340
 And she said, well, I guess, we were talking,

761
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,860
 and she goes, I guess I won't do much reading today.

762
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,300
 I said, what are you reading?

763
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,820
 She said, I'm just finishing Fifty Shades of Grey.

764
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,300
 And I said, oh, man, you don't want some man

765
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,620
 to love you like that.

766
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,780
 And she goes, you haven't read it, have you?

767
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,460
 You don't understand.

768
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,780
 And she goes, it's a love story.

769
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,340
 And I said, no, you don't understand what love is.

770
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,620
 You have redefined love in something

771
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,820
 it was never meant to be.

772
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,700
 That's what Beyonce and Jay are doing.

773
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,820
 You don't understand what love is.

774
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,660
 I said, you married?

775
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,180
 She said, divorced.

776
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,020
 I understand.

777
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,220
 I get it.

778
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,980
 I get it, there's a love, no greater love than this,

779
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
 that someone would lay down their life for you,

780
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,300
 Ephesians 5:25, that your husband would love you

781
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,580
 as Christ loved the church, man.

782
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,740
 Giving his life for you.

783
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,220
 That you would come and willingly submit

784
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,620
 to that kind of leadership as a man would come to you

785
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,980
 and say, hey, I'm putting you before myself,

786
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,180
 your contentment and joy before my own.

787
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,260
 Whatever I can do to care for you and to provide for you,

788
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,540
 not to steal from your vineyard, not to climb the fence,

789
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,780
 not to talk you into something you don't wanna do

790
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,340
 or give in to some emotional, passionate moment,

791
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,580
 saying, I don't fear God.

792
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,740
 'Cause that's the only reason he would do that.

793
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,180
 He doesn't fear God.

794
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,380
 God, I think I know better than you,

795
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,540
 here's what's happening when you have sex

796
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,300
 outside of marriage, okay?

797
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:01,060
 He's grabbing you by the face and pulling you close.

798
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,100
 And he's telling you, did you know

799
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:10,140
 that when left to my own desires or following God's will,

800
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,220
 I'm going to follow my desires?

801
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,700
 Over God's will.

802
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,940
 And you're dating, so it's at the very height

803
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,260
 of the relationship.

804
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,180
 I mean, he's trying to show you a false sense

805
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,660
 of who he really is to win your heart.

806
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,060
 And he's telling you right now, I am committed

807
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,820
 to being willing to have sex outside of marriage

808
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,300
 if it is what I feel like.

809
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,780
 And you say, no, you don't understand.

810
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,140
 He loves me.

811
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,300
 He does today.

812
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,340
 In fact, he loves you so much, he's willing

813
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,380
 to compromise God's word for you.

814
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,380
 In fact, he's telling you as sincerely as he can,

815
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,660
 and I'm picking on the guys right now,

816
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,900
 she's telling you, the adulterous woman is telling you

817
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,260
 as sincerely as she can that she follows her own hormones,

818
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,700
 her own desires, her own lust, her own drunkenness

819
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,180
 and love over the will of God.

820
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,620
 And she's committed to it.

821
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,540
 And if you marry that person, and that person goes

822
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,900
 outside the marriage, how can you blame them?

823
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,620
 They told you they would.

824
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,180
 They said that, they were committed to doing that.

825
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,660
 That's what their commitment is to, not to you,

826
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,700
 but to their feelings and their emotions.

827
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,620
 And the desires of their flesh,

828
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,020
 there's only one way to continue to experience

829
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,940
 the endorphins of sex outside of marriage,

830
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,660
 and that's to continue to have sex outside of marriage.

831
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,420
 And when that emotion fades, so does the relationship.

832
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,660
 It says, for your ways are in full view of the Lord

833
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,380
 and he examines all your paths.

834
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,740
 He examines all your paths.

835
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,220
 Some of you know that's verse 21.

836
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,100
 Some of you know your ways are in view of the Lord,

837
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,900
 and that's why you have no intimacy with God,

838
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,100
 because there's too much shame there,

839
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,340
 and you feel that God's mad at you.

840
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,140
 You haven't read the verses like Romans 8, 1

841
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,780
 that says there's no punishment for those

842
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,180
 who have trusted in Christ, or 2 Corinthians 5

843
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,700
 that says he's no longer counting your sins against you,

844
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,140
 that God loves you, he's not mad at you if you trusted him,

845
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,460
 that his son actually died because of the sex you've had,

846
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,580
 the porn addiction that you've had,

847
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,860
 the thing that even happened to you, that he died for that,

848
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,620
 that that went on him so that you can be free,

849
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,940
 that you don't have to walk in guilt,

850
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,580
 that the enemy's even winning by pushing guilt upon you,

851
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,220
 that that's the victory he has on you,

852
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,700
 that right now, it's not like I'm gonna change

853
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,540
 and I'm gonna get discipled and I'm gonna learn your word.

854
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,260
 It's like, ah, I can't believe I did that,

855
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,300
 and I'll never do it again.

856
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,300
 There's no plan in I'll never do it again.

857
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,300
 Grow in his word.

858
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,620
 Get to know him and how he loves you.

859
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,780
 Be discipled and equipped.

860
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,220
 Write the scriptures on your heart.

861
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,380
 You call yourself a Christian, like, walk.

862
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,420
 A Christian just means Christ follower, follow Christ.

863
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,100
 Follow Christ.

864
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,940
 And others of you, as I said already,

865
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,420
 read that verse that the Lord's,

866
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,380
 your ways are in full view of the Lord,

867
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,740
 and you don't care, you don't fear God.

868
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,900
 I have a friend that wrote that passage,

869
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,820
 Samantha Pugsley, or that article, rather,

870
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,020
 she said this, it's titled,

871
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,180
 I waited until my wedding night to lose my virginity

872
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,020
 and I wish I hadn't.

873
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,380
 She says, unfortunately, I can't go back,

874
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,420
 this is the last paragraph,

875
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,180
 unfortunately, I can't go back,

876
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,380
 but I can give you this message

877
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,860
 as a culmination of my experiences.

878
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,820
 If you want to wait to have sex until marriage,

879
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,540
 make sure it's because you want to.

880
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,580
 It's your body, it belongs to you, not your church.

881
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,500
 Your sexuality is nobody's business but yours.

882
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,340
 It's compelling.

883
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,780
 Let me read you two passages

884
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,380
 and let's just ask some questions.

885
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,740
 First one is 1 Corinthians 6, 18 through 20.

886
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,420
 It says, flee sexual immorality.

887
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,780
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body,

888
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,300
 but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.

889
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,740
 Do you not know that your bodies are temples

890
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,340
 of the Holy Spirit who is in you,

891
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
 whom you have received from God?

892
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,740
 You are not your own, you were bought at a price,

893
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,500
 therefore honor God with your bodies.

894
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,140
 So let me ask you now, and I'm really asking,

895
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,540
 who does your body belong to?

896
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,820
 I'm asking, who does your body belong to?

897
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,460
 It seems that the scripture says God, Samantha.

898
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,780
 Okay, let me just read another one to you, okay?

899
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,420
 For my married friends or those of you that will be married.

900
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,100
 1 Corinthians 7, verse four.

901
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,140
 The wife does not have authority over her own body,

902
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,380
 but yields it to her husband.

903
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,660
 In the same way, the husband does not have authority

904
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,940
 over his own body, but yields it to his wife.

905
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,580
 So who does a married person's body belong to?

906
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,100
 Their spouse, their spouse.

907
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,540
 So your body belongs to two people right now,

908
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,140
 God first and foremost, and the person that you enter

909
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,940
 into a covenant relationship with before him.

910
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,540
 That's who your body belongs to, it is not yours.

911
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,980
 To do with it as you please.

912
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,420
 The scripture exhorts you to maintain your sister

913
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,780
 and to maintain your well,

914
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,820
 keep it in the confounds of marriage.

915
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,700
 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them,

916
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,780
 the cords of their sins enhold them fast.

917
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,020
 I'm sorry, verse 22.

918
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,780
 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare them,

919
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,260
 the cords of their sins hold them fast.

920
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,580
 This is the lie of sexual freedom.

921
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,900
 You wanted the freedom to pursue something,

922
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,420
 and now you can't stop pursuing it.

923
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,980
 I wanted the freedom to look at pornography,

924
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,460
 and now I'm ensnared by it.

925
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,180
 I wasn't just led astray by it, I'm stuck in it.

926
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,060
 I wasn't just led astray by him,

927
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,100
 I wasn't just led astray by her,

928
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,420
 I'm stuck now in this relationship.

929
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,220
 I can't get out, I love her.

930
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,620
 It is the lie of sexual freedom.

931
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,580
 Verse 23, for lack of discipline they will die,

932
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,780
 led astray by their own great folly.

933
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,820
 For lack of discipline they will die,

934
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,620
 led astray by their own great folly.

935
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,700
 The other day we just moved into this house we're renting,

936
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,780
 and new neighborhood, and there's this guy

937
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,780
 that walks his dogs every evening.

938
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,620
 And just to paint the picture, this is a big dude,

939
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,220
 like he knows where the gym is,

940
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,220
 he's kind of, he's got muscles where they should be,

941
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,260
 a big man, and he's walking these dogs.

942
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,820
 Now here's where it gets peculiar.

943
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,820
 The dogs that he's walking are nine huskies, okay?

944
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,500
 You know what a husky is, it looks like a wolf?

945
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,660
 I thought they were wolves, my ignorance.

946
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,820
 I was like, dude, it's in our neighborhood with nine wolves,

947
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,260
 like we're moving, okay?

948
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,940
 And so, a husky's a beautiful dog though,

949
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,700
 I mean, blue eyes, like fur, really beautiful dog.

950
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,660
 These are sled dogs, you know, mush dogs, they pull sleds.

951
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,140
 My girls see them, 'cause there's lots of Disney movies

952
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,620
 made out of these dogs, and my girls see them

953
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,500
 and they like run outside, okay?

954
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,140
 They're like V-line to the dogs.

955
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,740
 At first I'm like, guys, they're wolves, stay back!

956
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,580
 [congregation laughing]

957
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,820
 And then he's like, oh no, it's okay, they can pet this one.

958
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,260
 I'm like, okay, what about the other ones, you know?

959
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,580
 What does that mean, they eat children for breakfast?

960
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,260
 Okay, and so, all's good, so you got my three kids

961
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,860
 in the midst of these nine huskies

962
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,460
 in this giant bodybuilder.

963
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,820
 And then the neighbor's kids, so the house next door,

964
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,580
 their kids run out as well, they want to see the puppies,

965
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,020
 vicious wolves, and what they didn't know

966
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,100
 is as they ran out the door, so did their chocolate lab.

967
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:33,260
 Now I think those huskies wanted to eat that chocolate lab.

968
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,900
 They took off, and you know what's interesting?

969
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,820
 That very strong man was not able to hold them back,

970
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,500
 for they are sled dogs, and it was really interesting.

971
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,700
 [congregation laughing]

972
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,580
 He was like, it was like that dog,

973
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,620
 that chocolate lab came out, and he was like, oh!

974
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,500
 And then all of a sudden he's running, you know,

975
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,300
 like they are in front of him, and he's running,

976
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,740
 he's like, stop, stop, stop!

977
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,700
 And all of a sudden he's being led

978
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,680
 by something that he thought he was in control of,

979
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,900
 but actually it was in control of him.

980
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,020
 And some of you, you think you're in control of your heart,

981
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,260
 and actually you are under its control.

982
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,940
 You are under its influence.

983
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,340
 If you look back on your life,

984
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,980
 you have followed it in and out of tragedy.

985
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,460
 In and out of terrible situations.

986
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,820
 In fact, your heart has probably led you

987
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,300
 into more disaster, some of you, than alcohol.

988
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,500
 Its influence in your life is actually stronger

989
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,500
 than alcohol or any other substance.

990
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,460
 The love that you have.

991
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,160
 And you know what the problem was?

992
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,900
 The problem was those dogs had not been trained

993
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,840
 in that scenario, and the problem

994
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,300
 that you came in here with tonight

995
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,520
 is you have not trained your heart.

996
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,420
 You've trusted it.

997
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,580
 You haven't trained it.

998
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,460
 You've trusted it.

999
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,020
 So my third and final point

1000
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,460
 is changing your thirst.

1001
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,540
 For lack of discipline they will die,

1002
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,180
 led astray by their own great folly, it says.

1003
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,180
 Led astray.

1004
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,340
 What led them astray?

1005
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,700
 The monster, the thirst that they had,

1006
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,660
 for she was thirsty.

1007
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,460
 She was drinking.

1008
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,380
 If you were here two weeks ago,

1009
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,540
 we talked about the monster.

1010
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,780
 This is your own foolishness.

1011
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,940
 This is your own desires.

1012
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,820
 This is you following your heart.

1013
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,340
 In fact, some of you here tonight,

1014
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,980
 you're so thirsty you'll drink anything.

1015
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,180
 You're that thirsty.

1016
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:34,020
 And so let's talk about the most frustrating

1017
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,180
 verse in the Bible.

1018
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,420
 You may know what it is.

1019
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,380
 Proverbs 4:23.

1020
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,020
 I like how y'all just went to write down

1021
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,780
 the most frustrating verse in the Bible.

1022
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,220
 Guard your heart for it's the wellspring of life.

1023
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,300
 Ladies, guard your heart.

1024
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,460
 Don't throw anything at me.

1025
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,300
 Guard your heart.

1026
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,580
 What does it mean to guard my heart, pastor?

1027
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,620
 What are you saying?

1028
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,300
 What am I supposed to do?

1029
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,660
 Take control of my feelings and emotions?

1030
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,180
 Am I supposed to lock 'em up?

1031
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,300
 Can't let anybody see it?

1032
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,540
 Okay, your guy's unsafe.

1033
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,780
 Guard your heart.

1034
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,660
 You might fall in love with him 'cause he helped you.

1035
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,940
 What am I supposed to do?

1036
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,980
 What does it look like to guard my heart?

1037
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,500
 First of all, I wanna apologize on behalf of the church.

1038
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,820
 Pastors have taught this verse out of context for years.

1039
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,740
 And I wanna show you what it actually means.

1040
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,300
 To guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life.

1041
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,980
 From everything out of life flows out from your heart.

1042
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,580
 That means your heart pursues what you give it,

1043
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,700
 what you show it, what you continue to put in front of it.

1044
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,860
 That's what it learns.

1045
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,380
 It has pattern recognition.

1046
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,940
 It learns, it says, this is what I want.

1047
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,620
 This is what I want, this is what I want.

1048
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,460
 Why, you're like, hey, why, I can never date a good guy.

1049
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,180
 I always date these dirtbags.

1050
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,740
 That's because you've taught your heart to love dirtbags.

1051
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,860
 That's why.

1052
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,940
 I can never date a good girl.

1053
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,860
 You know, I just, I always like these girls

1054
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,660
 that are no good for me.

1055
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,500
 What do you do on the weekend?

1056
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,100
 Oh, sometimes I go to the strip club.

1057
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,980
 You look at porn?

1058
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,460
 Yeah.

1059
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,220
 Cool, you've taught your heart to want a porn star, okay?

1060
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,180
 That's what you've trained your heart to look for.

1061
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,260
 That's what I want.

1062
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,180
 You've trained your heart for that.

1063
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,580
 You've conditioned it.

1064
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,580
 Woody Allen, when he married his stepdaughter,

1065
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,660
 came out with the famous quote,

1066
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,380
 the heart wants what it wants.

1067
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:21,460
 And I would tell you, no, the heart wants what it's fed.

1068
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,540
 The heart wants what you tell it to want,

1069
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,500
 what you train it to want.

1070
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,620
 And you're like, well, how am I training?

1071
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,420
 So what does it mean to guard my heart

1072
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,580
 when I'm alone with a guy and we're at the coffee shop?

1073
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,740
 How do I guard my heart?

1074
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,740
 You guard your heart long before that.

1075
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,900
 Okay, stop watching trash.

1076
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,940
 Stop saying, hey, this is the kind of guy I want,

1077
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,620
 a six pack and a doctor.

1078
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,460
 You know?

1079
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,940
 Nothing against the medical society, I'm just saying.

1080
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,780
 (congregation laughing)

1081
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,860
 Like, stop, you're like, hey, this is what I want.

1082
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,420
 You can retrain your heart

1083
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,940
 to actually pursue the right things.

1084
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,180
 Stop telling your heart, hey, I want a big busted porn star.

1085
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,220
 That's what I want.

1086
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:05,100
 I want a girl who will get naked for money.

1087
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,860
 That's what you've trained your heart to do.

1088
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,980
 And you're like, that's ridiculous.

1089
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,900
 No, it's not.

1090
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,180
 It's what you,

1091
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,100
 Satan has convinced you it's ridiculous.

1092
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,540
 The one who speaks lies,

1093
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,100
 the accuser has told you it's ridiculous

1094
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,380
 and you're living it.

1095
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,900
 You're so blind, you don't even see it,

1096
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,820
 that you're addicted to this sex outside of marriage.

1097
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,500
 And you're like, but I'm gonna be a great husband.

1098
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,980
 No, you're not gonna be a great husband.

1099
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:34,740
 But I'm gonna be a killer mom, I'm gonna be a great mom.

1100
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:37,580
 No, you won't, 50 Shades of Grey.

1101
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,580
 No, you won't.

1102
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,060
 You're gonna be a bad mom.

1103
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,780
 And I know that's so hard to hear.

1104
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,940
 But it's true.

1105
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:55,100
 Unless right now, tonight, you calibrate your heart.

1106
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,540
 You tell it what to love.

1107
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,340
 You tell it what to pursue.

1108
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,180
 You show it where to go.

1109
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,540
 What's the application?

1110
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,660
 I'll give you a really fun application.

1111
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,060
 You ready?

1112
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,620
 If you're gonna date, and I would really redefine dating,

1113
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,980
 I'm not saying kiss it goodbye or anything,

1114
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,860
 I'm just saying redefine it

1115
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,180
 according to what the scripture says.

1116
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,020
 Well, how do I do that?

1117
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,660
 You learn this book, okay?

1118
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,460
 And you read the parts of it that are about relationships.

1119
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,300
 First Peter three, Ephesians five,

1120
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,940
 stories in the Old Testament.

1121
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,100
 You look what God desires for a man and woman

1122
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,940
 when they spend together.

1123
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:32,940
 Well, dating's not in there, okay?

1124
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,100
 Well, dating, well then we really need to redefine it then.

1125
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,460
 It's not in there.

1126
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,700
 Because God's told us everything we need to know in here.

1127
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,700
 I think his intentions were actually

1128
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,140
 that you would fall in love,

1129
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,940
 that you would be drunk in love one time for a lifetime.

1130
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,780
 That's crazy, JP, you sure?

1131
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,740
 I think the world's statistics right now are crazy.

1132
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,380
 I think the world's track records are crazy.

1133
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,060
 I think the fact that you've bought into their way

1134
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,420
 over God's way is crazy, ludicrous, foolish.

1135
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,180
 That's what I think.

1136
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,740
 In 2005, there was a,

1137
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:13,300
 video was actually one of the most watched clips of TV.

1138
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,580
 It was Tom Cruise on Oprah.

1139
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,460
 Anybody see this?

1140
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,060
 Talk about being drunk in love.

1141
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,220
 I think we got a picture.

1142
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,540
 There he is.

1143
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,820
 Tom Cruise on Oprah.

1144
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,660
 If you haven't seen it,

1145
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,820
 I'd encourage you to watch this clip.

1146
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,060
 Watch this instead of reading the Beyonce, Jay-Z lyrics.

1147
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,300
 It's on YouTube.

1148
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,140
 Tom Cruise on Oprah, couch, we'll pull it up.

1149
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,780
 I mean, he's acting crazy.

1150
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,300
 And so this is why it went viral,

1151
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,340
 because the dude was acting crazy.

1152
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,380
 He had just started dating Katie Holmes,

1153
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,660
 who was 17 years younger than him.

1154
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,580
 He had just divorced his wife.

1155
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,740
 He's having illicit sex with a woman

1156
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,580
 who's 17 years younger than him,

1157
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,540
 and he's on Oprah acting a fool,

1158
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,100
 saying, "I'm in love, Oprah."

1159
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,700
 Jumping up on the couch, he kept doing this,

1160
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,180
 he did that like 16 times.

1161
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,100
 Saying, "I'm in love, Oprah."

1162
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,540
 He's like, "I've never seen you like this."

1163
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,740
 And he's like, "That's because I've never felt this way."

1164
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,740
 And there was a woman, I had lunch yesterday

1165
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,740
 with one of the leading marriage pastors in the country,

1166
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,100
 and we were talking,

1167
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,660
 and we were talking about that clip specifically,

1168
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,700
 and he said, "Yeah, there was a woman

1169
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,420
 "that came into my office,

1170
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,940
 "and I was counseling her around her marriage,

1171
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,260
 "and she just said, 'I wish my husband loved me like that.

1172
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,700
 "'I wish he was drunk in love.'"

1173
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,980
 In fact, my friend said he's never seen a marriage last

1174
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,180
 between two people who have followed their emotions

1175
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,900
 throughout their lives.

1176
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,660
 And the leading determiner,

1177
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,940
 whether they would get married or not,

1178
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,020
 is how they felt.

1179
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,780
 You just know, you know, and you just know.

1180
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,780
 You ever heard that?

1181
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,540
 And so this woman says,

1182
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,180
 "I wish my husband loved me like that."

1183
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,540
 And he said, "Are you kidding me?

1184
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:57,940
 "Do you know that's the fifth time

1185
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,220
 "he's never felt that way?

1186
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,620
 "Do you know that he just divorced his wife

1187
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,820
 "and is now having illicit sex

1188
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,980
 "with some girl who's 17 years younger?"

1189
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,740
 He says, "Hey, if you wish your husband loved you that way,

1190
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:14,460
 "I just want you to watch how that turns out, okay?"

1191
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,020
 If you don't know, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes,

1192
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,420
 they're divorced today, tragic divorce.

1193
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,260
 Didn't last.

1194
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,620
 And it won't last for you either

1195
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,060
 if you follow your feelings and emotions

1196
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,860
 above everything else.

1197
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,700
 JP, what do I do?

1198
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,340
 I can tell you, I see a lot of marriages.

1199
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,580
 I know which last, which don't.

1200
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,340
 It's all pattern recognition,

1201
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,740
 or so much of it is anyways.

1202
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:39,620
 You date someone who is fully committed to God.

1203
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,540
 That's the application.

1204
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,540
 I told you I was gonna give you a fun application.

1205
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,900
 If you're gonna go on dates,

1206
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,140
 if you're gonna date someone,

1207
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,580
 you find people who are fully committed to God.

1208
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,300
 A girl who has been discipled,

1209
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,700
 a guy who has been discipled,

1210
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,300
 a guy who has yielded to the Word.

1211
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,140
 And so what I'm saying, you're like,

1212
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,380
 "Wait, you're confusing me."

1213
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,380
 I mean go on dates with.

1214
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,100
 If you're gonna date, okay,

1215
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,540
 and if you're gonna go on dates anyways,

1216
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,460
 go on dates with the people who love God the most.

1217
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,620
 What if I'm not attracted to 'em?

1218
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,780
 Who knows, you might grow attracted to 'em.

1219
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,340
 But isn't attraction important?

1220
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,900
 You better be able to cherish your wife.

1221
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,460
 You better be able to love your wife.

1222
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,820
 You better be able to tell her

1223
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,900
 how beautiful she is truthfully.

1224
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,060
 That's important, absolutely.

1225
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,060
 Okay, but it may not come on day one.

1226
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,700
 So you may need to retrain your heart what beauty is.

1227
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,740
 You may need to retell your heart

1228
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,420
 and show your heart again

1229
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,780
 to stop looking for the porn star, guys.

1230
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,820
 And to start looking for the girl who knows the Word

1231
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,820
 and is ready to change the world for the sake of God

1232
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,340
 and she'll follow you anywhere.

1233
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,540
 And she's a part of his army.

1234
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,460
 And she'll go to war with you, man.

1235
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,460
 And she's out there like,

1236
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,340
 "I just, where's my stool, man?

1237
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,500
 "I'm gonna sit down, we're way over on time.

1238
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,300
 "I'm gonna talk to you guys.

1239
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,900
 "Let me just shoot you real straight, okay?

1240
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,620
 "It's a real talk, family time.

1241
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,900
 "Fort Worth, glad you're with us.

1242
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,300
 "Fort Worth is tuned in too.

1243
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,900
 "Guys, I'm gonna talk to you guys for a second.

1244
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,020
 "I'm sad for us.

1245
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,420
 "I'm real sad for us, guys.

1246
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,020
 "Like, I look at statistics.

1247
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,460
 "Can I just tell you guys, I'm talking to men,

1248
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,900
 "you're way outnumbered here.

1249
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,700
 "If you look around, like, there are,

1250
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,260
 "I'm just shooting you straight based on my observation.

1251
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,460
 "There are so much more solid girls here

1252
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,820
 "than there are solid guys.

1253
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,060
 "As far as how many girls here or how many guys here,

1254
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,620
 "I don't know, but I promise you,

1255
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,500
 "there are way more solid girls here than there are guys.

1256
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,580
 "And the reason, guys, is because you have grown addicted

1257
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,700
 "to the wrong things.

1258
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,100
 "You have trained your heart to look for the wrong things

1259
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,620
 "and to pursue the wrong things

1260
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,900
 "and to ask out the wrong kinds of women.

1261
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,580
 "And you have to calibrate your heart

1262
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,820
 "to tell it what to pursue,

1263
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,460
 "to stop following emotions and lusts of the flesh.

1264
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,580
 "You're setting yourself up for disaster, man.

1265
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,460
 "And ladies, I want you to be patient.

1266
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,500
 "God, you be patient.

1267
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,100
 "I'm not gonna give you an if/then statement.

1268
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,140
 "You may be patient and you may die in your patience.

1269
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,100
 "I don't know what else to tell you, okay?

1270
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,940
 "That may happen.

1271
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,500
 "I don't wanna jack with your heart and say,

1272
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,140
 "well, if you hold out and you wait for the perfect one,

1273
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,260
 "God's gonna give 'em to you when you're least looking,

1274
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,460
 "He might do that.

1275
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,340
 "He sometimes does.

1276
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,780
 "I've seen Him do that a lot.

1277
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,180
 "But ladies, don't sell out.

1278
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,460
 "Like in so many ways, you determine the value of sex.

1279
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,860
 "And when you devalue sex,

1280
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,180
 "the reason that guys go for cheap sex

1281
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,180
 "is because you made it cheap.

1282
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,060
 "So many of you have.

1283
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,220
 "And you've given away your bodies.

1284
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,380
 "You've left nothing to the imagination

1285
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,980
 "by what you wear, how you dress, how you act.

1286
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,780
 "And the Bible says that you're to dress in such a way

1287
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,820
 "that you do not bring attention to yourself.

1288
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,700
 "But often, when you stand before the mirror,

1289
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,660
 "your number one motive is,

1290
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,460
 "how can I bring attention to me?"

1291
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,460
 And that's not trusting God.

1292
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,540
 And so you hold out for that guy.

1293
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,260
 You wait for that one.

1294
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,420
 You train your heart.

1295
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,500
 Let me tell you something.

1296
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,980
 If you're listening to Drunk in Love by Beyonce,

1297
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,220
 you have been really foolish with your heart.

1298
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,860
 You have trained it to look for the wrong things,

1299
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,220
 and it's going to set you up for disaster.

1300
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,020
 And I know, but listen,

1301
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,380
 no one has ever accused me of being a legalist.

1302
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,260
 So that's not my intention,

1303
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,500
 so I'm not trying to put big rules on you.

1304
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,900
 I'm just saying, you need to be careful

1305
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,580
 what you let your heart long for.

1306
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,380
 Hear me?

1307
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,220
 We good?

1308
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,780
 All right?

1309
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,740
 Guys, if you're here and you're solid,

1310
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,020
 would you multiply your kind?

1311
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,660
 Like, if you're here and you know the Scriptures,

1312
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,140
 I need you to start making disciples quickly.

1313
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,180
 All right?

1314
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,660
 'Cause there's like two of you.

1315
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,140
 (congregation applauding)

1316
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,380
 You know, every lady in the house is clapping.

1317
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,700
 And I'm serious, guys.

1318
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,140
 Like, if you, and there's more than two of you.

1319
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,420
 That's not fair.

1320
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,700
 There's a handful of you.

1321
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,980
 There's like at least 12.

1322
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,180
 (congregation laughing)

1323
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,220
 I need you to start multiplying your kind.

1324
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,780
 If you know the Scriptures, if you know God,

1325
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,140
 like, stop wasting your singleness,

1326
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,780
 and start pouring into the lives of others

1327
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,820
 so that they would know God, too,

1328
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,860
 so that they would follow Him.

1329
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,620
 Because I think it would be a great legacy of the porch

1330
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,900
 is if we created, if God, through us,

1331
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,860
 produced healthy marriages that produced healthy children

1332
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,740
 who were also disciples.

1333
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,580
 And so it's this simple.

1334
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,540
 Be a disciple, date a disciple.

1335
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:30,020
 Not someone who goes to church.

1336
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,420
 Who doesn't go to church in Dallas, right?

1337
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,740
 Be a disciple, date a disciple.

1338
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,580
 What's a disciple?

1339
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,020
 Someone who has been poured into,

1340
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,100
 someone following Jesus, someone who knows the Word,

1341
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,700
 someone who's committed to walking in it and living it out.

1342
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,740
 Not someone who checked the box.

1343
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,940
 I'm a Christian, okay, great.

1344
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,140
 Match.com, you're a Christian, we're good.

1345
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,420
 No, a disciple.

1346
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,260
 Let me pray.

1347
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,340
 As I pray, the shane's gonna come up

1348
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,380
 and sing a song over us.

1349
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,780
 I just want you to sit and reflect.

1350
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,580
 There's heavy stuff tonight.

1351
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,820
 Some of you, you know you've gotta make some changes.

1352
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,940
 I'm not mad at you if you've trusted in Christ

1353
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,140
 for the forgiveness of your sins.

1354
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,860
 God's not mad at you.

1355
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,380
 But there is a war that is being waged in you.

1356
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,740
 And the enemy's winning in so many of you tonight.

1357
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,620
 And I'd love to flip the script.

1358
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,180
 I'd love to change that before you leave.

1359
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,820
 That you would surrender your life to Christ.

1360
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,500
 That you would trust that God pinned your sins

1361
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,340
 to a piece of wood on his son, Jesus.

1362
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,860
 That he killed him in your place.

1363
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,900
 That he received your punishment so that you don't have to.

1364
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,700
 God, thank you for that truth.

1365
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,740
 It's an incredible thing that the most terrible event

1366
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,940
 of the gospel is the most, or the scriptures,

1367
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,340
 is the most beautiful event of the scriptures.

1368
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,640
 That a bloody cross is an empty tomb.

1369
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:02,180
 Father, thank you for the work that you've done

1370
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,380
 in our hearts and in our lives.

1371
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,620
 And Father, just as we read over your scriptures,

1372
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,020
 the ones that are of you,

1373
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,660
 I pray that my friends in Dallas

1374
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,820
 and my friends in Fort Worth,

1375
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,640
 that their hearts would be connected and stirred

1376
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,340
 and that they would live that out in their cities.

1377
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,300
 And the ones that, anything that I said,

1378
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,420
 that's just wisdom for me

1379
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,100
 and not consistent with who your spirit is.

1380
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,620
 I pray they forget it before they stand up.

1381
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,980
 But regardless, God, I pray we'd leave changed.

1382
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,420
 Thank you for the truth of who you are

1383
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,260
 and the way you love us.

1384
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,120
 It's in Christ's name, amen.

1385

1386
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,120
