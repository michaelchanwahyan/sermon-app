[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.840]   Let's go.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.760]   Hey, welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.600]   Now we can clap for that.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560]   Friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.180]   Cedar Rapids, Spring, wherever you are joining
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.680]   or listening from as we continue this series,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.520]   Abuse on the Porch.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.720]   Hey, quick PSA, tonight's topic is a little bit,
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.440]   is a mature content, so if you have children
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.400]   with you in the room, this would probably be a good time
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.040]   to head to Sonic or some other place.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.960]   Or if you're listening at a future date,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.100]   this would be a time for you to probably hit pause
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.200]   and listen to it yourself.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.680]   I'm gonna start with a little bit of a story.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.480]   Recently, I have been in preparation for a talk
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.800]   that we may give at a future date inside of this series
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.240]   or at least at some point in the porch
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120]   in a number of different conversations
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   that I've recognized that as I sit in just kind of a circle
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.520]   and have these conversations,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.100]   a heightened sensitivity as I approach it.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.760]   And it's a conversation about race.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.000]   Race is a huge issue inside of our culture right now.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.800]   And just the conversation about how does the church
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.880]   play a role in bringing healing to an area
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.340]   where it seems like society is further getting divided
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.440]   and how do we be a part of that?
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.880]   And just as I've sat kind of in conversations
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.500]   in circles with people and we just try to listen
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000]   to one another and talk through how does the church
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.040]   play an active role in bringing this conversation about
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.860]   in a healthy way, I've just recognized like a sensitivity
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.120]   around it where I just, I wanna make sure that I'm not,
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.520]   by the questions that I ask, even the terms that I use,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.140]   either being invalidating or insulting
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.160]   and at the same time that I recognize
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.240]   and care for those who are there.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.800]   And I think the reason why is twofold.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.840]   One, I don't know if you can tell, I'm white
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.920]   and like extra white, like I get sunburn indoors.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.400]   And so there's that and so I wanna make sure that this,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.240]   you know, I wanna learn from different perspectives.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.460]   I think it's something that if the body of Christ
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.420]   can't learn to listen and hear different perspectives
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.940]   and care for one another, who can?
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.460]   And so I wanna be sensitive to that.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.680]   And then the other reason I think there's a sensitivity
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.780]   to make sure that the tenderness around that topic
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.660]   and just the handling of that topic is done really well
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.180]   is because historically, the church has not always
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180]   done really well about that topic.
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.980]   And so I wanna make sure that we are
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.220]   allowing the spirit of God to continue to create unity
[00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.500]   and just handling it really well.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.920]   I say all that because in the same way,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.920]   I feel that way about tonight's topic.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.360]   That it's one of those really emotionally charged things
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.840]   that is a part of the conversation often in culture
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.080]   and it's a conversation that has not always been one
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.860]   the church has handled well.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.400]   Tonight, we're gonna talk about the subject
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.280]   of homosexuality.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.760]   Last week, we dove into, hey, what does the Bible say
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.360]   about premarital sex?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.080]   And tonight, we're gonna open up the conversation
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.600]   about what does the Bible say about homosexuality,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.100]   specifically addressing the question of can you be gay
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.820]   or lesbian and be a Christian?
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.560]   And I know that this is not some political exercise
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.760]   that we're gonna have.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.920]   This is a personal issue for many people in the room.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.480]   Either it's something that same-sex attraction
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.880]   is something you personally have wrestled with
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.100]   or you may know someone, a family member, a brother.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.240]   And so this isn't some abstract idea.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.680]   This is a person that is connected to many of us
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.440]   inside of the room.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.940]   I know I've personally sat with friends who no longer,
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.720]   having once attended here or church in general,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.720]   won't come back because of the issue of homosexuality.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   And the church historically has not always handled it well.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.160]   There have been things done in the name of Jesus
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.520]   that were evil or they were ostracizing
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.840]   and they certainly were unloving and unchrist-like.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.800]   And yet at the same time, we live in a world
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.140]   that is continuing to move further and further away
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.460]   from God's word.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.100]   And so how do we maintain whatever the Bible says,
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.040]   which we're gonna explore tonight,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.760]   and also where can the church continue to take ground
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.000]   at an issue that seems to be on the fault line
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.500]   of our culture or just at the forefront
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.060]   of so much of the conversation?
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.400]   This has been used in a way
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.360]   I don't think it was ever intended to be, to hit people.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.400]   Or God didn't give it to us to beat people with.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.900]   He gave it to us in order that we would find life.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.280]   And so tonight, I'm gonna do as best I can
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.520]   to approach this subject in a way
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.080]   that I hope represents God's heart and God's word.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.240]   I know that I'm gonna fail.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.680]   This is one of those subjects where at the end of the night,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.920]   you always regret, man, I wish I would have said this better.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.840]   I wish I would have said that more clearly.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.320]   And so I fully expect and am well aware of the infallible
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.620]   or the shortcomings that my communication may have.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.280]   But as best we can, I wanna explore alongside of you
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.240]   what God's word says about the subject
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.800]   of what it looks like to be gay or to be lesbian.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.640]   So we're gonna look specifically at three questions.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.520]   Can you be gay and be a Christian?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.880]   Why or why not?
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.140]   And how the church must change on this issue.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.480]   So let's talk about the first one.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.740]   Can you be gay and be a Christian?
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.280]   Well, immediately it becomes a question
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.240]   of what do you mean by gay?
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.840]   If by gay, you mean someone who has homosexual
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.800]   or same-sex attraction, gay or lesbian,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.840]   I'm using interchangeably there.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.400]   If by that, you just mean you're talking
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   about attraction, yes or sure.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.000]   In other words, it's not homosexuality
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.660]   or homosexual attraction that will stop you
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.600]   from being a Christian and any more
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.980]   than heterosexual attraction makes you be a Christian.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.600]   You can have temptation and that's not a sin.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.560]   Homosexual attraction is not a sin.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.460]   Being tempted in a same-sex manner is not a sin.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.260]   But if by being gay, you mean homosexual actions,
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.520]   the Bible is a little bit, not a little bit,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.880]   it's a lot more clear.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.160]   Here's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.140]   Do not be deceived.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.400]   This comes from verse nine.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.980]   Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.980]   nor adulterers, nor men who have sex with men,
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.040]   or it's just the word homosexuality
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.760]   your translation may have, nor thieves,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.920]   nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers,
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.560]   nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.000]   Paul, are you saying that being gay
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.040]   will keep you out of heaven?
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   What Paul is saying is that having unrepentant sin
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.600]   in your life of any kind that you just embrace
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.440]   is not the mark of someone who's a member
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.020]   of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.600]   I mean, we can zoom in on homosexuality.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.100]   He really says, man, if you look at God's word
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.520]   and you embrace sexual immorality,
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   which is sleeping with anyone other than a spouse,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.920]   if you embrace idolatry, which is any time
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.240]   that we put anything before God,
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.540]   and that is an unrepentant lifestyle that you had,
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.440]   that's not the mark of someone who is a follower of Jesus.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.940]   And so any unrepentant sin that someone embraces
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.200]   and tolerates, Paul would say, that's the mark of someone
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.440]   who doesn't know God, or at least is certainly
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.400]   not walking with him and is very deceived.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.160]   And here's like the rub on this issue,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.920]   and let's be honest.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.640]   The biggest issue inside of the room from this list
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.880]   is not homosexual sin.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.800]   There's a lot more heterosexual sin
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.200]   that's taking place inside of this room.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.320]   I mean, Paul would say, hey, can you be an unrepentant person
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.020]   who's sleeping with your boyfriend
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.840]   and be a member of the kingdom of heaven?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.800]   Someone who's like, look, I know what God's word says.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.940]   I know that that's not okay.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.080]   I just don't care.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   And you know, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   I'm sure God will accept me.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.480]   I think Paul would say, you should be concerned.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.080]   If you have homosexual sin, you're just saying,
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.760]   I'm embracing, I don't care what God says.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.580]   You should be concerned.
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.600]   You're a gossip.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.440]   And you're like, look, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.820]   It's kind of, we bond over it.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.880]   I know God's word says it's bad, but I really don't care.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.680]   You should be concerned.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.720]   If you live for the weekend, you live for the party,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.600]   the next high, and you're like, man,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.680]   I know God really is not for that,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.200]   but it's not that big of a deal.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.400]   You only live once, and someday I'll get more serious.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.560]   You should be concerned.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.240]   Paul would say, those are not the characteristics
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.480]   of someone who's a member of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.900]   Said another way, who has Jesus as the king of their heart
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.260]   and their life, because Jesus is the king
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.820]   of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.740]   And so can someone be gay and be a Christian?
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.060]   If by gay, you mean sexual orientation
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.020]   or attracted to the same sex, yes.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.400]   And they can also not be.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.940]   It hinges around whether or not they have trusted in Christ
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.420]   as the payment for their sin and the resurrection
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.420]   that he came back alive, and they've trusted in that.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.120]   But can someone live an unrepentant, sinful lifestyle
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.120]   and embrace sin that Jesus, as the king, has said,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.940]   is not to be a part of the people of God,
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.280]   which is any type of the sins.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.460]   He lists out a whole bunch of them.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.040]   There's nothing distinct about homosexual sin.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.180]   Paul would say, no.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.740]   Or they should at least be concerned,
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.700]   because that is not characteristic of the people
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.900]   who are the members of the kingdom of heaven.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.940]   Homosexual behavior, not homosexual attraction,
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.640]   is sin, according to the Bible.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.580]   Well, doesn't Jesus say that we're not to judge?
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.740]   This would be a response you often hear
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.820]   inside of culture, that hey, we're to judge not, right?
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.820]   Didn't Jesus say judge not?
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.360]   So we shouldn't judge.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.140]   Jesus didn't say not to judge.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.500]   He tells us how to judge and who to judge.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.260]   If you read in Matthew chapter seven,
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.500]   you go and you read it, Jesus says, hey,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.860]   do not judge to a standard that you don't wanna
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.700]   be held to.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.420]   He says basically, hey, to the measure that you judge
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.720]   someone, you're gonna be held to that standard.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.780]   You need to know this.
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.240]   And then he goes into an explanation of how we are
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.080]   to judge someone.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   He literally says, hey, take the plank out of your eye,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.580]   then you can look at a speck in your brother's.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.980]   The Bible doesn't teach not to judge.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.300]   It tells us who to judge and how to judge.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.020]   First Corinthians chapter five, that's another letter.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.260]   Paul writes, and he says, you are to judge one another.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.900]   By judge, hold one another accountable
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.420]   to the standards of God's word.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.240]   That's what it teaches.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.140]   It doesn't teach, hey, judge not, you know,
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.100]   only God can judge me.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.200]   It says that we're to hold one another accountable
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.800]   to the standards inside of God's word.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.180]   It would be impossible for you not to judge.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.140]   And here's what I mean by that,
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.320]   or make judgments on things.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.220]   All of us come into the room and we all hold judgments.
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.720]   We all hold things that we believe that are wrong.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.380]   You probably came into the room and you're like,
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.420]   I think that
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:21.820]   child abuse is wrong.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:22.640]   That's a judgment.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.740]   Who are you to judge?
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.260]   We're all fine with that type of judgment.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.820]   The Bible is fine with that type of judgment
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.780]   'cause that's evil.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.140]   We all came in there, or many of us came in the room.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.860]   I'd say most of us, hopefully,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.900]   came in and said, hey, racism is wrong.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.220]   It's an evil atrocity and it's not okay.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.160]   That's a judgment.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.620]   The Bible doesn't teach not to judge.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.900]   It teaches us who to judge and how to judge in love,
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.260]   brothers and sisters in Christ alongside of us.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.140]   Another response people will say is, hey, you know,
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.620]   Jesus never specifically addresses this issue.
[00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.020]   Why didn't he bring it up?
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.420]   The reality is Jesus does address
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.660]   the idea of marriage repeatedly.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.020]   And he says it's between one man and one wife for life.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.220]   'Til death do they part.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.620]   He says this is the standard of marriage.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.540]   And he literally says, if you can't accept this,
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.620]   you should not get married.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.660]   But this is what marriage is.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.500]   And you may be thinking, yeah,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.300]   but he didn't specifically address homosexual behavior.
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.620]   What's the big deal?
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.540]   If the standard of what is okay and not okay
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.720]   is what Jesus doesn't, or Jesus explicitly addresses,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.560]   I mean, let's be honest,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.340]   there's a lot of things he doesn't address.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.100]   He didn't address wife beating.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.180]   But I don't think any of us are like,
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.460]   I think he was pro-wife beating.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.500]   He doesn't address heroin.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.740]   I don't know that anyone's like,
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.780]   yeah, he's a big heroin guy.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.860]   I think everyone would say, no,
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.860]   I don't think he'd be okay with that.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.980]   But he clearly lays out that Jesus' perspective on marriage
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.260]   and what God's design was,
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.740]   was between one man and one woman for life.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.500]   That's what Jesus says about the conversation
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.860]   of what marriage is.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.220]   In Romans chapter one, Paul makes abundantly clear
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.300]   that homosexual behavior
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:07.380]   is contrary to God's design for the world.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.460]   That God is the creator.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.060]   You can go read it later in Romans chapter one,
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.420]   where Paul lays out in verses 25
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.820]   through the end of the chapter
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.100]   that God created the world,
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.120]   he designed the world to work in a certain way.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.040]   And when man chases after sin,
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.260]   they reject the creator's design.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.100]   And they say, I know better than you.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.940]   And they run towards destruction.
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.060]   He gives a ton of different sins that man runs to
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.580]   when we reject God,
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.480]   when we reject the creator or the designer.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.940]   And we say, you created it, but we know better.
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.980]   You run towards, you don't know how to handle this life,
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.820]   he would say.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.640]   It doesn't just cover sexuality.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.620]   He says, they reject the way that God says
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.340]   they should use their words, their mouth,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.500]   their relationships with one another,
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.320]   with their parents.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.580]   He goes into a whole list of things.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.420]   But Paul makes clear,
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.480]   it is a rejection of God's created design
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.460]   and how he created the world to work.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:03.460]   Anytime that we abandon the inventor
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.000]   or the creator's intent, the creator's instructions,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.980]   things don't go well, generally speaking.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.300]   I mean, I don't know, there's two people,
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.820]   let me illustrate it this way.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.980]   There's two types of people in this room right now.
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.860]   There are people who, when you are doing laundry,
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.820]   you read the tags on your shirt
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:26.740]   about how to wash it and how to not and so forth.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.180]   And then there's guys.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.020]   And, um.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.260]   No, I'm sure there's guys out there who read the tags.
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.940]   But here's what's gonna happen for you gentlemen.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.180]   This is a public service announcement.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.060]   Let me help you out here.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.220]   A little marriage advice.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.580]   Someday, if you get married,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.520]   you're gonna be in the laundry room,
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.780]   just trying to be hubby of the year,
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:43.660]   putting the laundry in.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.940]   You're doing laundry for your wife.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.020]   You're like, don't worry about me.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:46.860]   It's okay.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.580]   If I get nominated for husband of the year, no big deal.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.180]   And doing the laundry, taking care of it.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.580]   This happened to me recently.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.700]   And I'm washing some of the clothes for my wife.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.020]   And she had this, I don't even know what to call it.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.000]   A poncho, I'm being told.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.520]   It was like an afghan blanket with a hole in it.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.060]   And you put it over.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.520]   And it was from, I don't know.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.940]   I'm just gonna embarrass myself
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.940]   if I try to name whatever store it was from.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.740]   And anyways, so I'm washing them, throwing it in there.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.560]   It's great.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.800]   All of a sudden, you get the laundry done,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.640]   everything's dry.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.460]   It comes out.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.700]   It looks like it was made for a seven-year-old.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.780]   And it's this tiny thing
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.980]   that she had just gotten for Christmas,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.980]   a very expensive item from a family member.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.940]   She's like, you ruined this cashmere.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.420]   Oh, okay, wow.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.260]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.180]   Judgmental people in here.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:40.020]   This thing is so tiny.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.180]   And I'm like, no, it'll be good.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.420]   I get it soaking wet again.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.660]   And I'm in the backyard,
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.540]   just trying to stretch this thing out.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.800]   And it was unsuccessful.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.680]   And I had failed to read.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.600]   She was like, you didn't read?
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.840]   It says on the instructions, do not dry, do not dry.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.520]   And I was like, who reads the instructions on these?
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.880]   Why would you put it in the dirty clothes hamper
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.360]   if you didn't want to?
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.960]   But in failing to read the instructions
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.840]   of the creator's design, it consequences.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.320]   Now, that on a micro level is comical,
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.480]   but it's the same thing that happens
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.960]   anytime that we abandon God's design for anything.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.880]   That there's pain that's introduced,
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.380]   there's consequences, there's damage
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.060]   that sometimes can be worked through,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.780]   but oftentimes can't be undone.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.660]   And that's what the Bible teaches,
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.640]   that God created the world,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   he designed it to work in a certain way.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.920]   And so this is why God is opposed to homosexual behavior.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.700]   So I wanna talk a little bit about
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.360]   why that may be even further.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.560]   So if God is not opposed to homosexual attraction
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.240]   taking place in a person,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.840]   but homosexual behavior being acted out,
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.640]   why would God be opposed to that?
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.760]   And I think there's a couple reasons
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.640]   that come to mind quickly.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.660]   So our second idea of why would God be opposed
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.840]   to homosexual behavior?
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.760]   I mean, if it's two consenting adults,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.280]   love is love, what's the big deal with one another?
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:00.400]   The first reason is because as it relates to marriage,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.440]   the idea that a man and man, if it's love together,
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.000]   that could be defined as a marriage,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.560]   is an offense to what God says
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.680]   all throughout the Bible, marriage is.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.360]   Which is not just a man and a woman together,
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.320]   though it is that.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.760]   It's ultimately a metaphor for Christ
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.080]   and his unending, unstoppable love
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.680]   for his bride, the church.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.520]   Ultimately, in other words, marriage is a picture,
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.160]   not just of a man and woman on earth together,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.840]   though that man and woman married together on earth
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.880]   is to be a reflection or to reflect
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.160]   what ultimately marriage is all about,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.440]   which is Christ and his love for his bride, the church.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.640]   And so to attack that is to attack
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.640]   what marriage really is all about,
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.680]   which is Jesus and his bride.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.200]   Paul says this in Ephesians chapter five,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.720]   verses 31 to 32.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.900]   I read it this past weekend at a wedding that I was doing.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.600]   I read it in every single wedding that I do,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   and it always jumps out to me.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.360]   Here's what Paul says.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.400]   For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.800]   and be united to his wife.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.040]   This reason being marriage.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.680]   And the two will become one flesh.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.380]   Like, that's crazy.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.480]   Two become one?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.840]   Wow, man, that's shocking.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.840]   Paul says this, this is a profound mystery.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.840]   Yeah, two becoming one, for sure.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.600]   But I'm talking about Christ and the church.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.560]   Paul says it's mysterious as man and woman,
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.560]   two becoming one together.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.400]   Ultimately, the more profound and greater mystery
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.880]   is not how to two become one,
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.880]   but is ultimately about how this thing,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.400]   this thing called marriage is ultimately about Christ
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.680]   and his bride, the church.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.720]   And so man doesn't get to decide what it is
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.520]   and what it's not because it's ultimately not about man.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.280]   It's about Jesus.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.080]   Second reason why I think God is opposed to homosexuality
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.400]   and homosexual behavior is because of the
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.520]   unbelievable consequences that come
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.840]   as a result of that lifestyle.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.200]   Consequences in the realm of mental health,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.540]   of life expectancy, of disease, and of divorce.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.340]   Here's what we know.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.680]   I mean, there's been studies that have shown this,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.760]   and I'm gonna list out some of the statistics
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.400]   and the sources that come from them.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.200]   Homosexual, people who live in a homosexual lifestyle
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.160]   are 50% more likely to suffer from depression and abuse.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.320]   They're 200% more likely to commit suicide.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.560]   That comes from a recent study
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.440]   in the Medical Journal of BMC Psychiatry.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.440]   Often suicide is blamed on religious people,
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.460]   or the church and societal pressure
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.560]   that makes them feel ostracized.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.640]   And so if only society would just be more tolerant
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.760]   and accepting than those types of behaviors,
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.680]   that depression, suicide, substance abuse
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.960]   would all go away.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.960]   And it's just not true.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.680]   There's a study done in Sweden,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.780]   a country that legalized in 1944 same-sex relationships.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.480]   A country that was named
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.680]   by the International Lesbian Gay Association
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.480]   the most friendly country in Europe, if not the world.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.560]   A country that in 2003 legalized
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.120]   that to talk negatively about someone's sexual orientation
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.660]   was a hate speech, punishable by crime or by jail,
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.480]   I mean by fine or by jail.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.100]   To even suggest, like I'm doing right now,
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.220]   that God's design was for man and for woman,
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.160]   I could be put in jail.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.360]   It's a country that has done as far as it can
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.880]   push the agenda to make sure
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.920]   that we create a tolerant environment.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.320]   And they don't have less or lower suicide rates,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.520]   they have higher.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.720]   The suicide rates that were found of this study
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.900]   by the European Journal of Epidemiology in 2016, May 11th,
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.800]   was that suicide rates in Sweden
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.640]   are 300% among the homosexual community.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.520]   The life expectancy,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.240]   there's consequences not just in that arena,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.240]   there's consequences in life expectancy.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.660]   And I'm not here to like beat down with stats,
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.840]   there's a God who loves you,
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.120]   who doesn't want this for anyone
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.200]   any more than you would want it for someone
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.920]   if it's gonna dramatically impact their life
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.380]   and the life expectancy.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.480]   The average life expectancy is diminished
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.020]   by between 20 and 24 years.
[00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.600]   The Eastern Psychological Association
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.100]   found that regardless of how tolerant the society is,
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.300]   the average is the same.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.060]   They did further studies in European nations
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.440]   that have gone to great lengths for many years
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.040]   to normalize homosexual activity,
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.940]   and they found that still,
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.920]   the numbers were consistent with the United States,
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.920]   on average between 20 and 24.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.320]   The study cites Denmark,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.500]   where heterosexual males live to an age of 74,
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.640]   compared to homosexual males that live to an age of 51.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.700]   The study Norway,
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.940]   where homosexual males live to an age of 77,
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.980]   heterosexual males live to 77,
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.240]   homosexual males to 52.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.980]   And lesbian couples,
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.460]   78 among heterosexual women,
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.280]   compared to 56 among homosexual.
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:55.180]   A study found that only 1% of homosexual men
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.820]   will die of old age.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.580]   1%.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.020]   The study concluded that the homosexual lifestyle
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.980]   is significantly more dangerous than even smoking.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.380]   And the God who's there, he's not angry,
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.740]   he's not a God who hates people in the homosexual lifestyle,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.580]   he's a God who loves you,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.180]   who doesn't want that for you.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.420]   Not only impacts mental health and life expectancy,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.380]   one of the reasons life expectancy is impacted
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.300]   is because of the prevalence of disease.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.820]   The United States Center for Disease Control in 2013 found
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.980]   that while only 3% of the United States population
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.880]   was homosexual,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.380]   the group is responsible for 50% of the cases of gonorrhea.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.980]   60%, I'm sorry, of syphilis.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.700]   60% of the cases of gonorrhea,
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.140]   and over 75% of the HIV cases in the last five years.
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.260]   The AIDS epidemic was so closely associated
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.100]   with the homosexual lifestyle
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.180]   that when it was originally coined in 1982,
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.460]   it was called GRID,
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.180]   Gay-Related Immune Deficiency.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.980]   But there was just a prevalence of this disease
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.820]   among this community,
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.940]   and the God who's there, he's not angry,
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.680]   he's not looking to rip you off,
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.940]   he loves heterosexual and homosexual alike,
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:03.440]   and he doesn't want us to live in a way
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.580]   that's contrary to his design in any way,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.900]   whether it's sleeping with your boyfriend right now,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.120]   whether it's abusing alcohol right now,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.040]   or whether it's living in a homosexual lifestyle right now.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.820]   Why is disease so rampant?
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.840]   There's two reasons, and I don't wanna be too graphic.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.260]   The first is because the human body
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.160]   is not made for anal sex,
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.500]   and the tissues and the things that are involved
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:35.020]   are more likely to create complications
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.420]   when sexual activity takes place.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.700]   The second is because monogamy
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.700]   is the extreme, extreme minority.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.280]   In other words, the likelihood of a gay married couple
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.140]   being committed exclusively to one another
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.280]   is not impossible, and it's not that it's never happened,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.900]   but studies have shown it is a promiscuous environment,
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.700]   often tolerated, and even openly,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.100]   it's fine to go after.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.780]   Here's what a Swedish gay couple
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.740]   named Andrew and David Madison did a study
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.880]   in the Journal of Sex Research.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.620]   They surveyed 2,583 couples who were married together.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.520]   They found that not a single couple
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.820]   was able to sustain a monogamous sexual relationship.
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:17.100]   The average number of partners among those 2,583
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.460]   was between 100 and 500 partners,
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.100]   sexual partners in their life.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.100]   Furthermore, the likelihood of divorce
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.900]   inside of a same-sex marriage is 50%
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.900]   if it's among gay men, and 167% more among lesbians.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.720]   Why would God be opposed to this lifestyle?
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.500]   Jesus summarized the great commandments
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.400]   for all of us, and he summarized really the whole Bible.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.900]   He was asked, "Hey, what's the greatest commandment?"
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.580]   And Jesus said, "You can sum up all of the law
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.940]   "and the prophets in Matthew 22,"
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.180]   and he said by two things, "Love God
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.040]   "and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.500]   The reason God would be opposed to this
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.760]   is because he knows it's hurting people of life.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.380]   Said another way, the reason why, as the church,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.260]   we feel the burden to talk and to shepherd
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.820]   through this issue and to talk about it
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.900]   and to share what God's word says
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.420]   is because we believe it would be unloving to not do so.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.620]   And people in the room are gonna say,
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.160]   "No, it's so bigoted, I can't believe
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.580]   "you just love, as love, as love."
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.900]   If someone in your community or someone in your life,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.340]   someone friend, maybe it's a family member,
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.440]   said, "Hey, I'm gonna make a decision.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.440]   "I'm gonna move to a city, and in this city,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.520]   "I'm gonna be more likely to be suicidal,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.080]   "I'm gonna be more likely to be anxious,
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.000]   "I'm gonna be, almost certainly,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.580]   "have a sexually transmitted disease,"
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.060]   and on and on from there, where I'm gonna have
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.540]   to have lots of time spent in hospitals.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.180]   And not only that, I am guaranteed,
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.100]   it's a statistical fact, almost,
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.400]   as close as you could get, if the average is 51 years old,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.120]   to die 24 years earlier.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.040]   And God clearly says that's not an okay city to live in.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.800]   Would it be loving for you to say,
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.780]   "Yeah, dude, go live there, man, you do you, come on."
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.760]   Of course it wouldn't be.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.340]   And they may respond with, "Oh, come on,
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.840]   "we can't just love as love.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.560]   "If you loved me, if you cared about me,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.720]   "you would encourage the fact
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.020]   "that I'm gonna go live in this city."
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.020]   As followers of Jesus, any more than we could
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.440]   encourage divorce, which we will not,
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.220]   and that's an entirely other issue we can touch,
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.680]   or any more than we would encourage someone
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.200]   to participate in a polygamous marriage,
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.680]   or participate in raising children in a way that is abusive,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.720]   we cannot encourage someone to make decisions,
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.020]   or to move to a city, or to choose a lifestyle,
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.000]   that not only God's word says,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.080]   he commands and calls us not to,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.680]   but even society, I mean, go look all those stats up,
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.320]   you can re-listen to it again.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.160]   These are not like, "Oh yeah,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.620]   "I made these up earlier today."
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.140]   They're clearly known things,
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.340]   and the consequences are huge.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.340]   And if you're sitting there in the room,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.280]   and you're thinking, "Gosh, this place is so bigoted,
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   "I can't believe it," I think we love them more than you do.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.220]   Because if someone is gonna choose a path
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.580]   that's gonna have unbelievably painful consequences,
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.300]   including leading to death, and you're like,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.400]   "I don't care, you do you, man,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.820]   "it makes me feel good inside to give you that approval."
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.000]   I, and this body of Christ, we love them more than you do.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.500]   Sadly, this is an issue that,
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.460]   for Christians increasingly more,
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:29.580]   you're gonna be called bigoted, hateful, homophobic,
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.120]   if you hold to these things.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.220]   There was recently, someone had come and spray painted
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.340]   outside of Watermarks building,
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.180]   where this is not the first time,
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.260]   it's not the last time, it's actually happened since then,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.540]   hey, Dallas tribe, whatever that means,
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.960]   racist, sexist, transphobic, biphobic,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.920]   and this has happened multiple times since.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.000]   On this particular occasion, it was a Sunday evening,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.960]   and someone had gone out there and spray painted,
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.880]   and the reason they say that, I get it,
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.080]   is because of talking about it like this,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.440]   and attempting to in a loving way.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.740]   You know what the gospel irony about that was?
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.440]   That night, you know, we went out there and cleaned that up,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.960]   one of the members who's plugged in here
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.740]   had his life changed, a black, same-sex attracted struggle,
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:20.200]   male, and a Middle Eastern man, both plugged in here,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.740]   went out, got down, and they began to clean it off,
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.500]   saying, this is my church home,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.540]   and people can call us bigoted,
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.680]   they can call me a racist, homophobic, transphobic,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.220]   as a black person who struggles with same-sex community,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.660]   or same-sex attractions, but my life has been changed,
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.020]   and I'll go out here and clean this up,
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.220]   and get on my hands and feet.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.380]   He's not the bigot in that situation,
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.020]   whoever spray painted that is.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.340]   The definition of bigot, you know what it is?
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.620]   Someone who doesn't tolerate other person's views.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.860]   If you get called a bigot for holding to the Bible,
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.060]   you're not the bigot, they are.
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.380]   I mean, that's a fact.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.220]   (congregation applauding)
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.780]   And that's, I mean, and we can clap all day long for it,
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.140]   but think about it.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.140]   If someone is saying, hey, look,
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.980]   I know you hold to this book of 2,000 years old,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.700]   it's been something around a long time,
[00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.180]   but I just think you're wrong, man,
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.460]   you're a bigot, you're an idiot, that's where you are.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.560]   'Cause my opinion tells me I'm right and you're wrong.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.900]   And if that's where you're holding inside of the room,
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.460]   I know that, I know,
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.860]   we're gonna get some emails on this one.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.700]   But,
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:32.300]   we are striving to love every type of person,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.260]   every sexual orientation that can be there.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.500]   And God's word is clear on this one,
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.780]   just like he's clear, candidly,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.080]   I'm gonna come back to it,
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.540]   on the heterosexual sin taking place in this room.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.180]   That is much more prevalent than any homosexual sin.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:52.100]   What if they find a gay gene?
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.340]   What if it comes out and they find like,
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.660]   man, there was a gay gene?
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.300]   To this point, studies have shown
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.200]   there has been nothing conclusively,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.060]   but here's the deal, even if they did,
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.420]   that would fit well within what the Bible says
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.580]   is total depravity,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.780]   or man having a sin nature that was born.
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.740]   I was born with a propensity
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.700]   where I wanted to have sex
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.500]   with every beautiful woman that I see,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.140]   but I don't know that anyone thinks that's a good thing.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.860]   There's been studies that have found,
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.740]   Time Magazine, in 2010,
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.820]   did an article that was called,
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.860]   Adultery, It's in Our Genes,
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.860]   that men have a propensity towards polygamy,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:27.580]   and they think there's a genetic passing
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.400]   that has taken place.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.880]   But I don't hear anyone being like,
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.700]   you know what, just let boys be boys,
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.100]   they can go sleep with whoever they want.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.940]   I think people would say,
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.220]   well, that's probably not good for society,
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.740]   even if it's in our genes.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.480]   Why would God make me this way?
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.700]   God did not make you,
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.020]   or he did not make someone in their sinful nature.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   We were all born with a broken sin nature.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.820]   He did not make any of us sinful.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.120]   He didn't make me polygamous.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.500]   He didn't make you anyway.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.200]   We were all born broken.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.460]   And in that brokenness,
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.500]   it manifests itself in all kinds of ways
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.660]   that go from there.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:10.300]   God is not the originator of your sin or mine.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.340]   He's the solution for it.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.700]   And he provided that solution
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.400]   by sending his son to be a savior.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:21.020]   So how should we as the church change,
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.460]   or how must we, as the body of Christ,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.540]   change our response?
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.580]   I wanna give just a few things,
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.900]   and then we're gonna close down here in a few minutes.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.220]   The first is that I think we have to change
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.940]   the approach that we have with nonbelievers.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.100]   The church has got to stop beating people
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.620]   with a Bible that they don't believe in.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.140]   If someone's not a follower of Jesus,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.940]   you don't point them to change their sexuality,
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.460]   you point them to their savior, to Jesus.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.180]   Let me say it this way.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.340]   God's biggest concern for someone
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.460]   who is in a homosexual relationship
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.500]   is not their sexuality.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.380]   It's them knowing their savior, Jesus.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.140]   None of us have to change our sexuality
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.500]   before you can become a Christian.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.380]   Hey, stop doing that,
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.660]   and then you can become a part of our group.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.140]   We invite people to come to know Jesus,
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.900]   and we trust that he will work at their hearts,
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.420]   and he'll begin to work inside of their lives.
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.000]   Just like you didn't change your behavior before you came,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.460]   you didn't stop the pornography addiction
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.900]   before you trusted in Christ.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.660]   And so the church has gotta be a place
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.980]   that stops pointing out people's sin
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.640]   who don't claim the name of Jesus.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.200]   We point them to their savior.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:26.260]   At the end of the day, God's desire for people
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.460]   is not calling them to be heterosexual,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.920]   it's calling them to be holy.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.560]   The second way I think we've gotta change
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.880]   is that we cannot be people who fold on truth
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.200]   and the truth from God's word,
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.080]   and we cannot beat people down with it.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.480]   We cannot be people who just say,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.560]   you know what, society's changed, it's fine, no big deal,
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.360]   who cares, I don't really read this thing anyways.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.760]   We have to be people who hold to the truth
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.600]   that found in God's word.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.240]   Sadly, there are entire denominations
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.920]   who are saying, ah, you know, it's fine.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.240]   Maybe we just missed it on this one,
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.320]   maybe society has changed.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.120]   The homosexual activity in the first century
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.080]   far outweighs anything that takes place today.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.080]   Go to any sort of historical research and you'll see that.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.880]   So to argue that like society's changed,
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   are you kidding me?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.640]   Pediastry was embraced and accepted.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.720]   In other words, pedophilia was embraced and accepted.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.200]   There was all types of sexual engagements
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.880]   that all of us would say is not okay.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.400]   Prostitutes were a normal part of society.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.280]   The sexual norms of that day
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.200]   were not way behind our heads.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.120]   They were not way behind ours,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.640]   like, oh, grandma's back there.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.160]   They were way past anything that we see today.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.720]   So to think that the Bible, you know,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.520]   it's got to catch up with the times, are you kidding me?
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:43.240]   They make Las Vegas look like tame.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.440]   I mean, that's true.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.560]   Do any sort of historical study on that.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.800]   And so we can't be people who are just like,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.160]   you know what, things have changed, throw the towel in.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.000]   Thankfully, those denominations are crippling
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.920]   and shutting down.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.080]   Because people aren't hungry for, you know what,
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.120]   this book really doesn't really matter that much
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.920]   and do whatever, you do you, man,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.340]   just show up and pay the tithe.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.340]   That's embarrassing and an affront to God
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.900]   and it's not the church.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.240]   The second way the church can't do,
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.280]   or we cannot respond is not just unfolding on truth,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.800]   but also on beating people down.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.720]   Examples like this.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.460]   This is offensive.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.200]   This is disgusting.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.560]   Not only because it uses an offensive term,
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.260]   which I'm not even gonna justify by using,
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.000]   but because it's not true.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.240]   In order for that sign even to be true,
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.560]   you have to put love in there.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.320]   Because God loves people in a gay lifestyle,
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.240]   people in a straight lifestyle, people of every lifestyle.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.540]   He loved them so much he would give his life for them
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.160]   if they were just them on the planet.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.360]   And that's an offense and that's disgusting.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.200]   And I know inside of this room,
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.080]   the church probably goes, yeah, amen, for sure.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   But anytime that we ostracize, alienate,
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.080]   or treat this sin as though it's something different
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.120]   than all the other ones,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.200]   we are in a minor degree participating in the same way.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.360]   There's no difference.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.180]   All of us are broken in need of a savior.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.940]   The third thing is around how we approach fellow believers
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.060]   who have same-sex attraction.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.400]   I'll move quickly through this.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.240]   How do we do that?
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.880]   How do we approach our fellow believers
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.300]   who struggle with same-sex attraction?
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.000]   We do what we do with people with,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.260]   or non-same-sex attraction.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.380]   We point them to truth.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.860]   We hope that they point us to truth.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.540]   We walk alongside them in community with one another
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.900]   and we bear one another's burdens.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.740]   The church has got to create safe environments
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.420]   for people to be able to talk about this.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.460]   Where people can come and know that,
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.420]   hey, I can bring forward same-sex attraction.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.500]   I'm not gonna be judged anymore
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.140]   than if I bring forward heterosexual attraction.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.920]   And we come alongside one another and we care
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.880]   and we lock arms and we fight against sin together.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.140]   This is what the body of Christ does.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.180]   We live in community.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.060]   And the third thing I think,
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.460]   where at least I can speak for myself,
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:51.100]   is I think we could do a better job of acknowledging
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.060]   the extent to which the gospel
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.860]   and picking up your cross daily
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.940]   is calling people who have same-sex attraction to.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:08.380]   In other words, I think even just some sort of recognition
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.740]   that look, dude, at the end of the day,
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.980]   all of us to follow Jesus,
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.460]   Jesus says, "Pick up your cross and follow me."
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.220]   But not all crosses are the same weight.
[00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.420]   And the reality that, man, in doing that,
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:19.300]   if you're a part of the,
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.660]   if you have same-sex attraction
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.500]   in a way that you're like, look,
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.420]   I've prayed for God to take it away,
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.460]   he's not taking it away.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.700]   And I've come to the reality
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.540]   that I am choosing to follow Jesus,
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.820]   I'm choosing that I may have a life
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.020]   of celibacy ahead of me.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.900]   We need to, as a body of Christ,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.060]   look at that and say what is true.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.660]   That's amazing.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.840]   Your faith inspires me.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.700]   The fact that you say, hey, though none go with me,
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.660]   I'm gonna follow you.
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.400]   If it costs me my sexuality,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.540]   I surrender it all to you, Jesus.
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.100]   You were an inspiration to me.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.260]   You strengthened my faith.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.900]   There are people of you in the room right now
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.780]   listening in Fort Worth, listening in Houston,
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.180]   you strengthen my faith.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.760]   You make me wanna be more like Jesus.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.340]   I think some of the strongest faiths at Watermark
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.060]   are men and women who choose to be celibate
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:36:59.900]   for the kingdom of God.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.380]   That's what you're doing.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.080]   Choosing to say, God, even my sexuality, it's yours.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   You're the Lord of my life.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.820]   Maybe the most Christ-like people in the church today
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.340]   are the people who say, God,
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.620]   even I would choose to be celibate for the kingdom of God
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.120]   just like my Savior was.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.620]   And you are an inspiration to me.
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.900]   And not all crosses are the same weight,
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:23.900]   but the way that you allow the one who's in you
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.540]   who's greater than the temptation you feel,
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.800]   greater than the world around you
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.480]   to be strong in the midst of weakness is an inspiration.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.140]   May God multiply your kind.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.420]   What I know is that in eternity,
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.780]   as hard as it may feel, even in this moment,
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.980]   the reality, I mean, think about it.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.060]   For those of you who are not same-sex attracted,
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.300]   think about just the crushing weight.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.080]   Many of us feel as singles in the room,
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.500]   wondering like, am I gonna be single for forever?
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.260]   I mean, think about it.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.600]   Think about waking up with the reality.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.440]   It's a crushing weight.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.300]   I mean, think about that.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.380]   If you were going, hey, unless God changes something here,
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.180]   I'm never gonna have that type of relationship
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.340]   where I wake up next to someone,
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.520]   where we raise children together.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.540]   God can change something.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.340]   We're gonna come back to that in a second.
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.540]   But that's amazing.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.200]   You inspire me.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   You make me wanna know Jesus more, follow him more.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.960]   And I'm confident that in eternity,
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:30.440]   everything that may be in stewarding this,
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.040]   that you experience,
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.920]   that you may miss out on, maybe marriage, kids,
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.120]   all of that stuff will pale in comparison
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.240]   to what God has in waiting for you.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.360]   'Cause here's what the scripture says.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.200]   It almost speaks of, in multiple places,
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.340]   that it's almost as though when we get to eternity,
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.660]   there's gonna be people who were not celibate,
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.040]   who were not same-sex attracted,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.000]   who look at you and they're like, dude, oh my gosh,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.720]   unbelievable, the way that God rewarded you.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.280]   I wish that on earth I would've walked through that.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.560]   It says this in Isaiah chapter 56, verses four through five.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.680]   "This is what the Lord says to those who are eunuchs,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.060]   "those who are same-sex attracted,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.100]   "those who keep celibate for my sake,
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.020]   "for the kingdom of God,
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.240]   "who choose to do what pleases me
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.480]   "and hold fast to my covenant.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.600]   "To them, I will give within my temple and my walls
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.700]   "a memorial in a name that is better
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.960]   "than sons and daughters.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.600]   "I will give them an everlasting name
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.440]   "that will endure forever.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.720]   "Those who choose to be celibate for the sake of God,"
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.800]   he says, "for all of eternity,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.480]   "I will give you a reward that makes anything in this life
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.600]   "that you missed out on pale."
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.200]   So what's ahead?
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.240]   I know that doesn't ease the burden or lighten it,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.280]   but at the same time,
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.160]   know that God has not forgotten you.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.440]   He sees you, loves you,
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.820]   and you are an inspiration to us.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.040]   The final thing that I think we need to do
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.520]   is that we have to put change
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.180]   firmly in the hands of the Holy Spirit,
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:55.660]   that people are not projects.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.240]   There is no, someone today asked,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.880]   does Watermark do the gay conversion therapy?
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.240]   No.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.960]   The Holy Spirit does change.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.940]   Watermark doesn't do any change, honestly.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.560]   The Spirit of God either moves in
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.580]   and begins to change in people's life, or he doesn't.
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.620]   And so as the body of Christ,
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.620]   we put change firmly in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.620]   We come alongside to encourage and walk alongside.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.980]   And it would be a disservice if I told you right now
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.500]   that if you just read your Bible enough,
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   God will change your sexual orientation.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:34.540]   And it would also be a disservice to God
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:35.940]   if I told you that he could not
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.500]   change your sexual orientation.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.560]   I have friends in my life,
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.320]   and they may be the rare exception,
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.100]   but it would be, if God can bring dead people alive,
[00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.420]   he can bring change about.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.700]   And yet he may just call you to steward that,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.740]   to show the world that Jesus is enough.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:56.300]   And to be an example to a community
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.380]   that only needs more and more examples.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.140]   But Paul even says it is possible
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.740]   if change does at times take place.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.860]   In 1 Corinthians chapter six, we read earlier
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.620]   where he said, "Hey, do not be deceived.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.340]   "Wrongdoers won't inherit the kingdom of God,
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.320]   "neither will sexually immoral, idolaters,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.180]   "adulterers," people who have sex with men
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.020]   or men who have sex with men,
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.820]   "greedy, drunkards, slanderers, swindlers.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.300]   "None of these will inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.100]   And that is what some of you were.
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.740]   But you were washed, were.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.340]   You were sanctified, you were justified
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.500]   in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.100]   That there are times that God, for whatever reason,
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.780]   chooses to move in and bring change,
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.240]   and other times, despite asking over and over, he doesn't.
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:38.140]   But I wanna show a video now, just to be an encouragement.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.920]   If you're finding yourself walking through
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   some of the valley of the shadow of just wrestling with that
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.060]   and where you can find encouragement
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.060]   and hopefully hope in the midst of that.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:56.780]   (congregation applauding)
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.180]   I hesitated to show that video
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.980]   because I know that it could paint the picture
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.860]   that that's what will happen, and that's what God does,
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:06.340]   and I know that's not true.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.180]   I know it is possible, and I know he does, and he has,
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.880]   and I've seen it in close friends' lives,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.280]   but I know he often doesn't.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.700]   And he allows you to shout to the world, "Jesus is enough."
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:24.740]   And what's amazing is
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:30.540]   there's such an amazing, beautiful purity
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.380]   in following Jesus when you surrender that.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.020]   I mean, really, when you surrender anything
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.140]   and you surrender your life, it's a lot easier to hide.
[00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.620]   When heterosexuality is just a part of your struggle,
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.940]   or pornography is eating you alive,
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.380]   or you're sleeping with your boyfriend,
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.380]   but when you have to say, "Man, I'm gonna surrender publicly,"
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.980]   you can't hide, and that's amazing.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.220]   And there are many of you inside of this room
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:05.100]   who strengthen this church and the church.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.220]   If I had a son, or I do have a son, if I...
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.180]   If I had one, which I do,
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.140]   I have a son named Cruz, he's two and a half years old.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:22.420]   He's the best thing ever, next to his mom and sister.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.180]   And there came a day where he came to me and he said,
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.980]   "Dad, I'm attracted to guys."
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.940]   He's 12, he's 16, I don't know when.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:37.340]   And thinking about this this week, I was going,
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.300]   "Dad, I hope that I would respond
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.660]   "in a loving way that would point him
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.100]   "to the truth of God's word."
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:49.620]   'Cause if I didn't, if I was like,
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.720]   "Man, I'd throw this out the window
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.180]   "'cause now it's different," I would not be loving him.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:02.980]   And at the same time, I mean,
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.020]   to be something I would never wish on him.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.140]   I say that just like I don't think anyone in the room
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.380]   would wish it, or even wants or wishes,
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.940]   if that's a part of your story.
[00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:17.480]   But if he chose to honor God in his singleness and said,
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.180]   "I'm gonna choose to be celibate for the kingdom of heaven,"
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.440]   I would be so proud of him.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.820]   I would be so much more proud
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.140]   than if he was the quarterback of the football team
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.780]   who was dating the cheerleader captain
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.740]   and had everything going on, but he didn't know Jesus.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.600]   I would be heartbroken for him at that stage.
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.540]   But if he was someone who said, "God, despite the fact that,
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:38.700]   "was I born this way, was I not?
[00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.840]   "I don't really know, for whatever reason,
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.620]   "this is what is a part of my wiring,
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.820]   "and I'm choosing to honor you, God, with even that,"
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.020]   I would be so proud of him.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.060]   And if you're inside of the room
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:50.900]   and you're choosing right now,
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.220]   "Hey, God, above my desires, above my sexuality,
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   "above anything else, I surrender it to you.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.420]   "And I'm gonna choose to honor you.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.860]   "You're the God, you're the king of my heart,
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.300]   "the king of my life, and I'll honor you with even that."
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.920]   I am so proud of you, and you have a heavenly father,
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.400]   just like I was with my son or would be with my son,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.720]   who is so proud of you.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.560]   Keep going.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.800]   Don't lose heart.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.120]   The scriptures say that this life is like a vapor
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.520]   and it will end, and today, I know the burden
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.400]   and the weight of that is heavy.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.160]   You are not alone.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.300]   And the body of Christ and the spirit of Christ are there
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.800]   and want to be there in increasingly better ways.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.760]   And you strengthen us, you make us better.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.400]   May God multiply your kind and make us better ministers
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.380]   to every sexual-oriented person out there
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.260]   of every different kind.
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.100]   Let me pray.
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:53.660]   Father, I just wanna pray first for...
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:46:02.360]   For men and women inside of this room,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.520]   who for whatever reason,
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:12.440]   you have allowed to experience an orientation
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   that may not align with God's word.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.280]   And I pray that you would strengthen their faith.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.600]   You would multiply their kind of people who just say,
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.280]   "God, above my sexuality, regardless if I'm homosexual
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.460]   "or heterosexual, you're the king,
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.180]   "and I surrender it to you.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.840]   "Help me."
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:33.400]   And so I wanna pray specifically for friends in the room
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.880]   that struggle with same-sex attraction, God,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.680]   that you would fill them with hope
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.760]   and that you would be so big inside of their life
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.720]   that everything else would be moved to the side.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   Father, I wanna pray for all of us
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.360]   who can be tempted every single day
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.960]   to make something or someone else sit on the throne
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.160]   of our hearts and of our lives that you would win
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.660]   and you would take ground.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.280]   We all walked into this room sexually broken
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.380]   in one way or another.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.740]   And we all walked into this room sinfully broken
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:13.400]   in many ways.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.420]   And we need your help, God.
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.080]   Would you help us to bear one another burden,
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.720]   to walk alongside of one another,
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.600]   and to be an example to a watching world
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.600]   that Jesus is enough, and he's king, and he's good.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.000]   We worship you now in song.
