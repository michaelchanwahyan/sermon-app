[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   Hey porch, join me as we read God's word together.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.560]   From the Gospel of Luke chapter 8 verses 26 through 39.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.880]   Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.120]   When Jesus had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.280]   For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house but among the
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.840]   tombs.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.600]   When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and said with a loud voice, "What
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.640]   have you to do with me, Jesus, son of the most high God?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.840]   I beg you, do not torment me."
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.960]   For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   For many a time it had seized him.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.680]   He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.440]   and be driven by the demon into the desert.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.040]   Jesus then asked him, "What is your name?"
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.460]   And he said, "Legion."
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.480]   For many demons had entered him.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.120]   And they begged him not to command them to depart into the abyss.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.040]   Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.640]   them enter these.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.740]   So he gave them permission.
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.680]   Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.040]   bank into the lake and drowned.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.940]   When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.660]   Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.560]   whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.560]   they were afraid.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.600]   And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.780]   Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerizim asked him to depart from them,
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.920]   for they were seized with great fear.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.360]   So he got into the boat and returned.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.520]   The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.360]   him away, saying, "Return to your home and declare how much God has done for you."
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.240]   And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him."
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.600]   Now our fifth message in our series called "Disciple."
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   [Applause]
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   >> PORCH, HOW WE DOIN'?
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   WE DOIN' OKAY TONIGHT?
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   [Cheers]
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   HEY, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YA.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.960]   THANKS SO MUCH FOR MAKING TIME TO BE BACK WITH US THIS EVENING.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.000]   SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO ALL OF OUR PORCH LIVE LOCATIONS.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.880]   LOVE WHAT GOD'S DOING AROUND THE NATION.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.280]   I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW IT, THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HERE IN DALLAS, BUT THERE'S A
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.480]   SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT TO PORCH LIVE SPRINGFIELD, MIDLAND, AND BOISE, IDAHO.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   LOVE IT.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.080]   HEY, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD, BUT ON MARCH 20TH OF THIS YEAR, HISTORY WAS MADE AS CHRIS
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.120]   BROWN IS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.960]   HE'S THE ONE WHO'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.960]   HE'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE PORCH LIVE.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:50.200]   HISTORY WAS MADE AS CHRIS BROWN, NOT SEA BREEZY, BUT A MODERN EXPLORER FROM YORKSHIRE,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.240]   ENGLAND, JOURNEYED TO ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE PLACES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.160]   HE MADE HIS WAY TO POINT NEMO.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:13.200]   POINT NEMO IS INFAMOUSLY KNOWN AS THE LONELIEST LOCATION ON THE PLANET.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.640]   BECAUSE POINT NEMO IS FARTHER AWAY FROM ANY SINGLE LANDMASS THAN ANY OTHER SPOT IN THE
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   ENTIRE GLOBE.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.920]   IT'S LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:31.080]   AND WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT POINT NEMO IS THAT IT IS KNOWN AS THE OCEANIC POINT OF INACCESSIBILITY.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.280]   ANYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO GET THERE.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.520]   IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO REACH.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.600]   AND THE CLOSEST HUMANS NEARBY TO POINT NEMO ARE NOT IN FACT ON PLANET EARTH.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.560]   THEY ARE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AS IT FLOATS IN ORBIT ABOVE THE LOCATION.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.960]   POINT NEMO IS ALSO KNOWN AS AN INTERGALACTIC DUMPING ZONE.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.260]   IT'S WHERE NATIONS WILL DISCARD SPACECRAFT BECAUSE IT IS SO WILDLY REMOTE TO THE REST
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.840]   OF CIVILIZATION.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.040]   AND YET CHRIS BROWN DECIDED TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.800]   GO WHERE NO MAN HAD GONE BEFORE.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.520]   AFTER FIVE YEARS WORTH OF PLANNING, 21 DAYS OF JOURNEYING, AND STANDING 1600 MILES FROM
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.540]   THE NEAREST SHORELINE, HE FOUND HIMSELF NOT JUST IN A BOAT, BUT SWIMMING AT POINT NEMO.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.520]   WHEN ASKED WHY DID YOU DO IT, CHRIS VERY SIMPLY SAID, "I'M AN ADVENTURER AT HEART.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.880]   I GO PLACES NO ONE ELSE WILL."
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.680]   WHY DO I TELL YOU THAT?
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:36.000]   BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST AND CHRIS BROWN, THE EXPLORER, HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT JESUS DOESN'T GO PLACES NO ONE ELSE WILL.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.280]   HE MOVES TOWARDS PEOPLE THAT NO ONE ELSE WILL.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   JESUS MOVES TOWARDS THE LONELIEST IN LIFE.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.460]   HE JOURNEYS TO REACH THE MOST INACCESSIBLE IN OUR WORLD.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.840]   HE WANTS TO REACH THE MOST ISOLATED OF ALL.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.240]   AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE SEEKS TONIGHT.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.480]   SO IF YOU HAVE A BIBLE, YOU CAN TURN WITH ME TO LUKE CHAPTER 8.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.040]   LUKE CHAPTER 8.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.680]   JUST TO CATCH YOU UP, WE HAVE BEEN IN A SERIES CALLED DISCIPLE WHERE WE'VE BEEN ASKING THE
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.920]   QUESTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO REALLY FOLLOW JESUS?
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.560]   WHICH FEELS LIKE A PRETTY OBVIOUS QUESTION TO ANSWER.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.520]   MANY OF US, WE WOULD ASSUME THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT IS.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.200]   AND YET, IF WE REALLY GOT UNDERNEATH WHAT WE BELIEVE IT MEANS TO FOLLOW JESUS, WE'D
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.280]   PROBABLY FIND SOME THINGS LIKE IT MEANS BEING A GOOD PERSON AND GOING TO CHURCH AND READING
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.680]   YOUR BIBLE AND SERVING THE POOR AND GIVING WHEN THE COLLECTION PLATE COMES AROUND AND
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.760]   MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE CONFESSING YOUR SIN.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.560]   WE WOULD LIST OFF A BUNCH OF BEHAVIORS.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.400]   AND YET, WHAT THAT WOULD TELL ME IS THAT FOR MANY OF US, WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT JESUS, BUT
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.240]   WE DON'T KNOW THE REAL JESUS.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   YOU SEE, BECAUSE THESE THINGS, WHILE THEY'RE PART OF THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE, THEY ARE
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.520]   NOT AT THE HEART OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CHRISTIAN.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.680]   BECAUSE AT THE HEART OF BEING A CHRISTIAN IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.640]   LIKE TO HAVE AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD HIMSELF AND TO LIVE A LIFE THAT IS ACTUALLY
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.760]   CONNECTED TO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOU YOURSELF AND TO JOURNEY TO THE END OF YOUR TIME AND
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.600]   TO FEEL LIKE MAN, I LIVED FOR A LASTING IMPACT AND TO FIND WITH OTHER PEOPLE A SORT OF FRIENDSHIP
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.360]   THAT BECOMES FAMILY BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A DEEP CONNECTION TO THEM THAT THE WORLD KNOWS
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.920]   NOTHING ELSE OF IT.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.640]   THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A DISCIPLE.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   IT'S TO BECOME LIKE JESUS.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.060]   AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS, WHEN JESUS IS INVITING US TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, HE'S INVITING US INTO
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.800]   SOMETHING WE ALREADY WANT.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.640]   LIKE WE ALL WANT THIS.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.060]   THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF FOLLOWING CHRIST.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.480]   LIKE HE WANTS TO DO IN YOUR LIFE WHAT YOU AND I WANT DONE IN OUR LIFE.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   LIKE WE WANT TO GROW INTO SOMETHING GREATER.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.840]   LIKE WE WANT TO BE SHAPED INTO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.000]   WE WANT TO BE MOLDED INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.040]   AND YET WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT JESUS IS HE'S GOING TO DO THAT IF AND WHEN YOU FOLLOW HIM.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.960]   BUT HE DOESN'T JUST DO IT FOR YOUR GAIN.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.420]   HE DOES IT TO THE GLORY OF GOD AND HE DOES IT FOR THE GOOD OF ALL PEOPLE.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.940]   LIKE THAT'S AN IDENTITY, THAT'S AN ACTIVITY THAT I CAN GET BEHIND, THAT I WANT TO BE CONNECTED
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.580]   TO AND THAT'S THE SORT OF LIFE THAT JESUS IS PROMISING US IF WE WOULD CHOOSE TO WALK WITH
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.580]   HIM.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.540]   IF WE WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH HIM AS HIS DISCIPLES.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.740]   AND SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING OVER THE COURSE OF THIS SERIES ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.740]   DISCIPLE.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.700]   THAT WEEK ONE, TO BE A DISCIPLE MEANS YOU ANSWER HIS CALL.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.220]   THAT YOU DROP YOUR NETS.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.220]   YOU LEAVE EVERYTHING.
[00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.640]   YOU FOLLOW AFTER HIM.
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.220]   NOT JUST BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO COST YOU SO MUCH, BUT BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO OFFER YOU
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.500]   SO MUCH.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   IN WEEK TWO, TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, WE LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO HEAR HIS HEART.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.860]   THAT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE HEAVY, THAT THE WEARY AND THE HEAVY LADEN, THEY CAN COME TO
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.300]   JESUS BECAUSE HE IS GENTLE AND LOWLY AT HEART.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.060]   IN WEEK THREE, TO BE HIS DISCIPLE, WE LEARNED WHAT IT MEANT TO OBEY HIS WORDS.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.720]   THAT ALL THE LAW AND ALL THE PROPHETS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN THE TWO GREATEST COMMANDMENTS.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.220]   TO LOVE GOD AND TO LOVE HIS PEOPLE.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:14.440]   AND TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT TO BE HIS DISCIPLES, WE SHOULD SEEK HIS PEOPLE.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:21.720]   WE SHOULD NOT LIKE THE GREAT ADVENTURER CHRIS, BUT THE GREAT SAVIOR JESUS, PURSUE THE LONELIEST
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.940]   IN LIFE.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:29.220]   WE SHOULD MOVE TOWARDS THOSE INACCESSIBLE TO THE WORLD AND ISOLATED MOST OF ALL.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.200]   WE SHOULD PURSUE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT WE FIND IN LUKE CHAPTER 8.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.800]   SO IF YOU HAVE A BIBLE, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT VERSE 26 TOGETHER.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.840]   THIS IS WHAT IT SAID.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   LUKE 8, 26.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.400]   THEN THEY, TALKING ABOUT JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES, OKAY?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.760]   THEY SAILED TO THE COUNTRY OF THE GARISENES, WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF GALILEE.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.640]   WHEN JESUS HAD STEPPED OUT ON LAND, THERE MET HIM A MAN FROM THE CITY WHO HAD DEMONS.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.780]   FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WORN NO CLOTHES, AND HE HAD NOT LIVED IN A HOUSE, BUT AMONG THE
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.780]   TOMBS.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.260]   WHEN HE SAW JESUS, HE CRIED OUT, AND HE FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM, AND HE SAID WITH A LOUD VOICE,
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.860]   "WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH ME, JESUS, SON OF THE MOST HIGH GOD?
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.540]   I BEG YOU, DO NOT TORMENT ME."
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.500]   FOR HE HAD COMMANDED THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT TO COME OUT OF THE MAN.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.220]   FOR MANY A TIME IT HAD SEIZED HIM.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.980]   HE WAS KEPT UNDER GUARD AND BOUND WITH CHAINS AND SHACKLES, BUT HE WOULD BREAK THE BONDS
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.840]   AND BE DRIVEN BY THE DEMON INTO THE DESERT."
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.980]   So just to set the scene, Jesus and his disciples, they have just journeyed across the Sea of
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.860]   Galilee to a land known as the Decapolis.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.260]   And what we didn't read is that they encountered a little bit of trouble along the way.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.460]   There's a storm that arose, and yet with but a word, Jesus silences the storm.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.940]   What we see from Jesus is that he has authority in that story over the natural world.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.140]   And yet as we come to this moment, as they step into the land of the Gerasenes, we find
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.300]   that he not only has authority over the natural world, but he has authority over the supernatural
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.300]   world.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.220]   You see, they come to a land known as the Decapolis.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.420]   The Decapolis, without going into too much detail, is Gentile country.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.100]   It wouldn't have been native to Jesus and his disciples.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.220]   It was a pagan land, which meant there were no Jewish festivals, no Torah study, there
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.020]   was no observance of the law.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.460]   In fact, it was odd that Jesus and his disciples would even go to this place to begin with.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:28.520]   Like it wasn't widely seen as appropriate for Jews to go to the Decapolis.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.460]   It was frowned upon even.
[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:35.940]   And yet Jesus, being Jesus, takes his disciples and they come aboard shore and they step out
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.300]   onto the bank.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.580]   And as his disciples look at him wondering, "What are we doing here?"
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.020]   Jesus makes clear that he will go to the darkest of places for the darkest of people.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   That's what we learned.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.300]   Jesus goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.980]   If we as his disciples, as people that are going to walk with him, if we're going to
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.660]   see the kind of people that he sees and seek the sort of people that he seeks, we need
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:04.780]   to know he's going to go to some dark places to find some dark people.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.140]   And the way Luke writes it, he tees the story up like a contest between two really great
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.140]   challengers.
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.060]   It says, "When Jesus had stepped out onto the land, there met him a man from the city
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   who had demons."
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.100]   Like it sounds like the main card from a pay-per-view title fight.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:26.420]   Like in this corner, out of Nazareth, wearing the white trunks, Jesus, the son of God.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:34.060]   And in this corner, out of the Decapolis, wearing no trunks at all, the crazy man, right?
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.660]   That's the way it sets this thing up.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.540]   And yet what you find as you keep reading is before the first punch is even thrown,
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.700]   the demon-possessed man just hits the mat.
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.660]   He's laid out, and there's good reason for it, but before we can actually unpack why
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   that is the case, before we can look at the state of this demon, we have to look at the
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.180]   state of the man.
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.020]   So what do we learn about the condition of this man?
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.500]   Just how dark is his situation?
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.340]   Well, we get some descriptors for him.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.660]   It says he has no clothes, that he didn't live among society, he had no home.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.180]   If you go and you read the same account in the Gospel of Mark, you find that night and
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.420]   day he would cry out and he would cut himself with stones.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.580]   And in both accounts, you see that he was living amongst the dead.
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.180]   He dwelt within the tombs.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.380]   Why does any of that matter?
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:30.340]   Because it shows us that the evil this man had indulged, it had dehumanized him.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.580]   Like it made him less human.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.300]   And that's what's important for us to know.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   Just cards on the table here at the very beginning of the night.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   It is imperative that we deal with our evil.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.700]   We reckon with our sin.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:52.580]   We take action on the sort of things that God gives conviction to, lest we be dehumanized
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.940]   like this man.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.220]   How is he dehumanized?
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.260]   He's dehumanized in three ways.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.920]   He has no dignity.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   He has no dignity.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.860]   Like he no longer wore clothes.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.780]   That's pretty indignified.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.420]   He has no community.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:11.180]   He no longer lived amongst the general population, but instead he lived in total isolation.
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.340]   And he has no security.
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:16.700]   He doesn't have a home to speak of, but he sleeps amongst the dead in the tombs.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.780]   Now to be clear, we don't know why the demons had entered this man originally.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.940]   We don't know what actions he took.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.340]   We don't know what sort of evil he was entertaining, what sins he had committed.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.600]   All we see are the effects of it.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.220]   That's what it means whenever it says that he was left unclean.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:39.980]   That word unclean, it's translated as defiled or violated, which I don't know about you,
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.620]   but when you read this story and you hear about a demon possessed man, it feels pretty
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.620]   unrelatable.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.400]   Like, man, okay, I've done some things, but I'm not quite at this spot.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.420]   This guy seems to have a different level of trauma.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.060]   There's some sort of condition he's facing that I'm not facing myself.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:01.140]   And yet when you realize that uncleanness means defilement or it means violation or
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:07.780]   it's to be stained or tarnished or corrupted, it begins to creep into your reality a little
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.220]   bit because those are words that we can relate to.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.260]   I know I can, and maybe you can as well.
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:22.540]   We know what it's like to feel defiled, what it feels like to feel corrupted.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:32.460]   You see, for many of us, we got into something that we thought was going to give us life,
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.200]   bring us freedom at some point.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.740]   And yet somewhere along the way, whatever that thing is, it actually got hold of us
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:47.740]   and it started to separate us from our family and our friends, started to isolate us from
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.620]   the rest of our community.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.300]   It started to lead us to a place.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.700]   We never thought we would actually be.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.940]   It's defiled us.
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.660]   Maybe for some of you, it's something that you can't believe you've done.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.220]   Like there's a shadow of shame that hangs over you because of some action you took or
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:12.340]   some place you went or something you said that it's just left you feeling like, man,
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.840]   this is unforgivable.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.140]   This is unspeakable.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.060]   I will never tell anybody of what I've done.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.900]   This thing that I did, that place that I went, that action that I incurred, that is something
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.180]   I'm going to take to the grave.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.380]   I refuse to tell anybody about that.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.080]   And yet you're defiled because you're carrying so much shame for something that you never
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.740]   should have to carry.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.740]   Maybe it's not that.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.620]   Maybe it's an addiction you have, some unhealthy habit that you adopted at some point and it
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.460]   was small and it was manageable and it actually felt nice to begin with.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.800]   But at some point it's grown to a place where you really can't corral it.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.020]   You truly can't control it.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.860]   And what it's now done is it's grown to a spot where it's jeopardizing your family and
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.420]   your friends and your finances and your future.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.040]   Maybe it's not an addiction.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:06.300]   Maybe it's the, the shame you feel for an abortion.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:13.260]   Like you found yourself in a situation that you never thought you'd be in.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.980]   Like you never intended to put yourself in a spot that felt so overwhelming and yet when
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:24.880]   those feelings began to grow so great and the anxiety began to cripple so strongly,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:31.600]   you were forced to make a decision the likes of which you've only felt regret for since
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.420]   that time.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.120]   Maybe it's not that.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.620]   Maybe it's some deep seated anger you have towards somebody.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.020]   Maybe it's habitual impurity you have with your boyfriend or your girlfriend.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.700]   Maybe instead it's shame from lying at your job, cutting corners, despair from, from,
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.620]   from cutting or self harming yourself.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.500]   Maybe it's not something that you've done.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.760]   Maybe it's something that's been done to you.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.420]   Like maybe the defilement you feel in your story, the uncleanness you have in your life
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.520]   is the product of what someone has done to you.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.780]   Maybe it's, it's the fact that someone physically hurt you.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.020]   Someone sexually exploited you.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.740]   Someone emotionally manipulated you.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.820]   They did something to you that they should never have done and yet you've been left to
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.980]   pick up the pieces and make amends on your own.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.860]   I don't know what it is for you and yet what I do know is that whatever darkness hangs
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.780]   over you, whatever leaves you feeling unclean, whatever sin you hide and whatever hate you
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.820]   harbor you try to keep out of the public eye, whatever it is that leaves you feeling so
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:38.500]   dirty, Jesus looks at it.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.300]   And he says, I want you anyways.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:50.620]   You see, Jesus is not afraid of the defiled parts of us.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.540]   We know that because Jesus journeyed across the sea for this one man.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.820]   But by the end of the story, we find that he has to leave.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:06.060]   He made the journey as an all sovereign, all knowing God to reach this one guy, totally
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.380]   undignified, totally defiled, totally despondent.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:16.300]   And yet Jesus goes that distance because there's nothing about this man's condition that worries
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.840]   our Christ's compassion.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.020]   He would go the greatest distance to be to him because Jesus is not a shepherd of spotless
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.780]   sheep.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.620]   He's a shepherd to black sheep.
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.300]   He's a shepherd to people like you and me.
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:37.020]   Mark 2, 17 says, those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.820]   I came not to call the righteous.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.420]   I came to call sinners.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.620]   You see, Jesus welcomes the unacceptable.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.560]   He embraces the unlovable.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.760]   He redeems the unforgivable, like that thing in your life, like the part of yourself that
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.140]   feels so dirty, the portion of your story that's too devastating, the piece of your
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.220]   existence that feels so dark.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:01.780]   And Jesus looks at it, he looks past it, and he says, I will take you anyways.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.980]   I want you as you are, not some future version of you, not some cleaned up version of you.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   I want you exactly as you are.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.460]   Yes, will we work this out?
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.460]   For sure.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.060]   Will I lead you to someplace better?
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.060]   Of course.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.260]   And yet I don't need you to lead yourself there.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.020]   I will lead you there myself.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.980]   This is what Jesus is offering for you.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.220]   He doesn't look at the worst parts of you and think, I've got to work around this thing.
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.660]   No, he wants everything about you.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.940]   He wants you to come to him because he will fix the worst parts of you and he will love
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.780]   every part of you.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.780]   This is what Jesus does.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.340]   He goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.780]   He doesn't retreat from the ugly parts of who we are.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.900]   He advances towards them.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.100]   That's the heart of your King.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:52.180]   And yet we know as we keep reading is that we see before Jesus can help this man, he
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.500]   needs to deal with the source of the evil in this man's life.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:03.740]   So he asks him in verse 30, what's your name?
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.700]   And the demon possessed man said, Legion for many demons that entered him and they begged
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.300]   him not to command them to depart into the abyss.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.700]   Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside and they begged him to let
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:15.740]   them enter these.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.980]   So he gave them permission.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.700]   Then the demons, they came out of the man, they entered the pigs and the herd rushed
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.900]   down the steep bank into the lake and they drowned.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.900]   Okay.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.100]   What's going on here?
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:33.860]   Well, this is the only time in any gospel that we see Jesus actually engage in a dialogue
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.900]   with a demon, that he actually has a conversation that we see Jesus say one thing, the demons
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.620]   say something back and Jesus respond accordingly.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.780]   This is the only example of a dialogue we have between Jesus and a demon.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:51.260]   And now scholars, they present a variety of different reasons for why this may be.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.580]   Some scholars suggest that Jesus is presenting the ancient near Eastern or Jewish methodology
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.140]   for exorcism.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.620]   That burst, you must establish contact.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.300]   The next you must have them share their name.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.020]   And then thirdly, you must cast them out.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.500]   Some people think that this dialogue is an evidence of the formidability of the evil
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.060]   in this man, that Jesus can't just cast it out, that instead this demon has something
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.740]   he wants to say to Jesus and he has the strength to back it up.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.140]   And yet here's what I would say to those things.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.140]   I think it's so much simpler than that.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:30.900]   Like I think what we see as Jesus asks this demon's name is just how powerful Jesus actually
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.400]   is.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.140]   So let me set it up like this.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:41.440]   How does college game day decide where they're going to broadcast every single weekend?
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.780]   They pick the best matchup for the weekend.
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.980]   Like they pick the two top teams.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.260]   They don't pick two no names.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.060]   They pick two name worthy opponents and they decide that's where we're going to go and
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.980]   we're going to highlight this specific matchup.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:00.860]   Now what happens when one of those teams spanks the other one?
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:08.700]   The strength of the team that wins is magnified because they overcame not a no name opponent,
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.720]   but a name worthy opponent.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.340]   They're proven to be powerful.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.540]   That's what Jesus is doing.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.040]   He's saying, hey, you actually have a name that we need to hear because it says something
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.380]   significant about who you are and yet it's going to say something really significant
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.840]   about who I am.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.900]   So what does the name Legion actually represent?
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:34.260]   Well, Legion is actually a unit within the Roman army that contained anywhere from 5,000
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:40.660]   to 6,000 men, meaning that there's not a square inch of this demon possessed man's life that
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:45.980]   is not disturbed by this supernatural evil.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.220]   But that's not all it means.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:53.020]   The name Legion, because it is representative of the Roman army, also demonstrates the harshness,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.980]   the brutality of Roman occupation.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.500]   And so there's not a square inch of this man's existence that isn't disturbed and there's
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.820]   not a square inch of this man's experience that is not horrible.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.100]   Like that's what the name Legion represents for this guy.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:14.060]   And yet Jesus, he in the face of one that is both great in number and great in strength,
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:22.020]   that is powerful by all accounts, he makes him do something you would not expect.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.140]   How do these demons respond?
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.740]   They're a great Legion when they come to Jesus.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.380]   They run, they cry, and they fall down.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.380]   That's it.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.940]   Like they behave like spoiled little children that don't get their way.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:43.540]   They get eerily upset because Jesus is so much more dominant, so much more powerful
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.540]   than they are.
[00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.260]   And the reason we need to know it is because whatever intimidates you cowers before your
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.340]   king.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.660]   Whatever intimidates you in life, it cowers before your king.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.620]   Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how bad, doesn't matter how significant it may
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:05.700]   feel in strength, it has no chance against Jesus Christ.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.700]   Think about it.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:14.200]   Like this guy is possessed by a group of highly militarized demons, a lethal fighting force
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.780]   by all accounts.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.420]   And all they can manage to do whenever they face Jesus is grovel and beg.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.420]   That's pretty pathetic.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.420]   And yet that's how powerful Christ is.
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:29.980]   Like this man has been subdued under their authority for years, and yet in a moment,
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.580]   they are subdued by Jesus' authority for all time.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:39.980]   In verse 27, it says that they call Jesus "Son of the Most High God," which is really
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.980]   interesting.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.940]   Like if you read through the Gospel of Luke, and I actually think that this is true in
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:50.700]   the Gospel of Matthew too, what you find is that Jesus is only called the Son of God four
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.620]   times.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.980]   Three of those times happen in the life and the ministry of Jesus.
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.660]   And what's fascinating is that in the life and ministry of Jesus, when he's called the
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:06.860]   Son of God, he is never called that by any single human.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:13.940]   He's called the Son of God by the angel Gabriel whenever Mary is conceived with son.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.460]   He is called the Son of God by Satan whenever he comes to tempt Jesus in the wilderness,
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.420]   and he is called the Son of God in this story right here.
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.660]   That leaves one other example when Jesus is called the Son of God.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.660]   And you know what happens?
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.620]   It's not in the life and the ministry of Jesus, it's at the arrest, death, and crucifixion
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.620]   of Christ.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:36.700]   And it's in that moment, at the point of his mockery and not his ministry, that mankind
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.500]   speaks up and calls him the Son of God.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.300]   It's not in reverence, it's in ridicule.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:50.180]   And yet what we know is that while we may have a hard time acknowledging the deity of
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.740]   Jesus, angels and demons do not.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.900]   They have no problem acknowledging that he is king.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.020]   James 2, 19 says, "You believe that there is one God.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.620]   Good, even the demons believe that."
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.940]   And they shudder.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.180]   You see, these demons, they make no mistake when they see Jesus.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.180]   They know who he is and they respond the only appropriate way when they come into the presence
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.280]   of royalty.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   They fall down.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.580]   Like, that's it.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.820]   They bow low in the presence of his royalty, his divinity.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.900]   They do what I knew a lot of college students did whenever I worked in college ministry.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.460]   They would realize that their academic future hung in the balance between whether a teacher
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.420]   was going to give them a good grade or a bad grade.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.620]   And so they would grovel and beg before their professors, "Please, God, would you just have
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:37.620]   mercy?"
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.460]   And they would hope to God that their professor would actually give them the kind of grade
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.940]   they needed.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.020]   They would beg, they would bow.
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.580]   They did what these demons themselves do.
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.740]   But the possessors of this man's life, they shudder at the sight of Jesus.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:02.980]   And so whatever possesses you, whatever's taken hold of your life, whatever appetites
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:11.420]   you feel within your sinful nature, those things shudder at the sight of Christ as well.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.460]   Now I get that some of you hear that and you think to yourself, "But you don't know what
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.460]   I've done.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:23.300]   Like you don't understand how long I've been entertaining this thing or how deep down the
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.820]   rabbit hole I've gone, how dark the stain actually is.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:28.820]   You don't know.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.020]   I've been at this thing for a long time.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.820]   You don't know how far gone I feel.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:37.020]   Like I understand this may be true for other people when it comes to Jesus, but it's not
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.020]   true for me."
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.420]   And yet here's the thing that I would tell you, regardless of what your addiction is,
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:47.740]   regardless of whatever your vice is or your lust may be, you're not the exception to this
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.740]   rule.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:53.780]   Like some of you think you are the exception to this, but you're not.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:00.260]   Like think about this man, Jesus, he's not negotiating the terms of this man's release
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.260]   from these demons.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.180]   "Hey guys, listen, I know that he's done some bad things.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.300]   I will let you go into those pigs if you let me have him back."
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.560]   He's not negotiating the terms of this man's release.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.460]   He is negotiating the terms of their surrender.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.640]   That's who Jesus is.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.180]   That's how strong he is.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.340]   Like they know we don't stand a chance.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.980]   Like Jesus may be outnumbered, but we're the ones that are actually outmatched.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.060]   So it doesn't matter like how long you feel like you've been trapped in sin or how perverse
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.100]   it's grown or how often you frequent it or how hopeless you feel.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.900]   Jesus is stronger.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.580]   He's matchless.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.420]   He's uncontested.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.300]   He cannot be overcome.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.060]   He is indomitable.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.060]   That's your Jesus.
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.620]   Yet here's my fear.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:58.680]   I fear that some of you, you won't see your defilement as deep enough to do something
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.900]   about it tonight.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.580]   Like your sin is still concealable.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.740]   Like you can hide whatever it was you looked at because it was private browsing or incognito
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.740]   mode.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.860]   You can delete the history.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.260]   Nobody will know.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.780]   Or you justify like it's just sexting.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.780]   It's just foreplay.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.700]   We're not going all the way.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.860]   Or you rationalize the gossip you indulge with friends because this is what they do.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.380]   I don't want to be a part of it, but they're my friends and so I have to engage with it
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.020]   so that way I'm not left out or I seem awkward.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.380]   Or you defend something on the grounds of, "Everybody has a little too much to drink."
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:47.260]   Or everybody bends the truth every now and then and you make small concessions that will
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.060]   lead to great compromise.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.540]   Here's what I would tell you.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:30:02.340]   You may not seem as outwardly defiled as this man, but you are inwardly defiled all the
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.780]   same.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:10.460]   And hear me on this.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.420]   The end of defilement is always death.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.420]   That's what the pigs are about.
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.140]   I don't know if you've been wondering, "Man, it's kind of a weird swerve in the story,
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.700]   a strange development that we've got these pigs that these demons want to go into.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.740]   What's the whole purpose?
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.060]   Why does Jesus allow it?"
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.860]   There's a lot of different speculation as to why it may be, but here is the simple and
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.860]   short of it.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:36.260]   It shows us what the ultimate ambition of evil is.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.700]   The ultimate ambition of evil is the destruction of life.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.860]   That's its ambition.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.860]   That's its aim.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.420]   It does not want you to succeed.
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.020]   It wants you to fail.
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.420]   It wants you to fall.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   That's what the enemy is trying to do.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.660]   And that's why I am pleading with you to do something about it tonight, to come to Jesus
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.980]   with it tonight.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:03.260]   I can't want it for you any more than I do right now.
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.180]   And the reason I want it so badly for you is I know what the results are.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.180]   That's what we see as we keep reading on.
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.740]   We see in verses 34 through 35, "When the herdsmen saw what had happened, that the pigs
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.740]   had drowned, they fled and they told it in the city and in the country.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:22.420]   Then the people went out to see what had happened and they came to Jesus and guess what they
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   found?
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.940]   Was it a naked man?
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.460]   Was it a crazy man?
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.340]   Was it a man that still lived within the tombs that was bleeding and frosting at the mouth?
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.420]   No, they found the man from whom the demons had gone and he was sitting at the feet of
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.420]   Jesus.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.860]   He was clothed and he was in his right mind and they were afraid.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.160]   Now they're the ones that are afraid.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.340]   Like just think about the before and after shots of this guy.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:51.700]   Like before this man had many demons, after no demons whatsoever.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.620]   Before he had no clothes, after praise God he got clothes somehow.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:03.180]   Before he fell down before Jesus and he shouted and yet now after he is sitting at the feet
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.420]   of Jesus and he is in his right mind, he's listening.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.940]   What could your before and after look like?
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:19.580]   Like before I was addicted to porn, but after I'm porn free.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:25.620]   Before I was insecure, I was codependent on other people to meet my emotional needs and
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:32.700]   yet now I'm totally secure because I'm connected to Christ.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:38.340]   Before I was afraid that no one would ever remember me and yet now after the fact I know
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.340]   that God will never forget me.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:49.980]   Before I lived for the acceptance of people and yet after I know that Christ died to prove
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.460]   just how much he wanted me.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.800]   What could your before and after look like?
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.380]   Because Jesus wants to do it and he wants to do it tonight.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.740]   I really believe it.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   This is how he works.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:09.620]   Like he doesn't just remove the chaos from your life, he introduces order to your life.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:10.940]   That's the nature of peace.
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:16.580]   Peace is not just the absence of conflict, it is the presence of flourishing.
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.940]   Like if this man's life was a garden, Jesus the gardener, he would come in and he would
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.660]   remove all the stones and all the debris and pull all the weeds, but he wouldn't just leave
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.740]   it like that because he wants to bring peace.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.140]   He would plant something beautiful in its place.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.220]   He wouldn't just pull out what was wrong, he would put in what is right.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.580]   He would plant life.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:47.700]   And the beauty of it is it takes this man from being defiled to dignified.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.100]   It's a radical transformation.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:54.420]   It's so radical in fact that it leaves the people freaking out.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.820]   Like they're the ones that are afraid now.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.260]   They're the ones that cannot comprehend how in fact he went from where he was to where
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.740]   he in fact now is.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.140]   Like what if God wants to do something in your life that would freak the people out
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.140]   around you?
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.220]   Like if he wanted to move you from where you are to where he in fact wants you to be, if
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.860]   he took away the evil in your world and he put in its place something so beautiful and
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.340]   right.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:21.620]   We know from this story that that is his heart, that that's what he wants to do.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:27.300]   It says in 37, "All the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes, they asked him,"
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.180]   talking about Jesus, "to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.580]   So he got into the boat and he returned.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.940]   The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with them.
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:46.340]   But Jesus sent him away saying, 'Return to your home and declare how much God has done
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.340]   for you.'
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:54.660]   And he went away and he proclaimed throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   him."
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:03.300]   Like Jesus gives dignity and he gives destiny like you wouldn't believe.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:08.140]   Jesus gives dignity and he gives destiny like you wouldn't believe.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:13.940]   Like Jesus did not just rescue this man from unbelievable problems.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:19.420]   He rescued him to an unbelievable purpose.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.020]   He gives it like you wouldn't believe.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.500]   It would blow your mind to see what he would do in the life of someone, to see what he
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:31.580]   might do in the life of you if you would just take a chance on him.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.500]   What was this man's purpose?
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.260]   Well this guy can't see it yet.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:43.100]   But what we know is that Jesus, he leaves the Decapolis because these people are afraid
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   of him.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.140]   They ask him, they beg him to leave and he concedes.
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.180]   He pulls away.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:56.620]   And yet Jesus' purpose for this man is to be the very first missionary that Jesus ever
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   sends out.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:04.060]   And what we find is that he does it.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:09.660]   He steps into an obedient posture and as Jesus comes back to the Decapolis only one other
[00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.660]   time in his life.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:15.600]   What he finds is a very different reception waiting for him on shore.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.360]   At the end of this story, these people want him to leave and yet when Jesus finally comes
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:27.640]   back around what he finds are 4,000 people that can't wait to learn from him.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.040]   They can't wait to get near to him.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.880]   Where do they come from?
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.920]   This one man.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:45.440]   They heard the story about a savior that gives dignity to the undignified, that gives destiny
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.760]   to the damned.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.880]   And they knew, "I need that too."
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:57.080]   And so they came close.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.520]   Paul says it like this in 2 Corinthians, "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.120]   you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.240]   Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.580]   may rest upon me.'"
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:19.260]   This demon possessed man, he was willing to boast his weakness and the results are astounding.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:26.300]   He embraced the weakness of his story because it expressed the greatness of his God.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.700]   So last story.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:34.660]   A couple years ago, Brooke and I were flying to Nashville when a flight attendant hopped
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.860]   on the intercom and made a very common announcement.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.980]   Attention passengers, it seems that we're going to be encountering a little bit of turbulence
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.060]   here in just a few short moments.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.180]   If you would please return to your seats, fasten your seat belts.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.580]   Nothing alarming in the slightest.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.580]   Made total sense.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.060]   I'd heard this announcement before.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.240]   It was commonplace.
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.300]   That is until the flight attendant came back on the intercom.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:10.180]   And attention passengers, it does look like we will be experiencing some turbulence and
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.380]   it will be quite a bit of turbulence.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:19.020]   Yet we want to encourage our white knuckle flyers, do not fear, though it may grow bad
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.020]   outside, you can rest assured.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.860]   You're completely safe within the comfort of this plane.
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:34.780]   I remember I'm not one that gets anxious on planes.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:40.940]   Yet it was in hearing that message that I began to grow somewhat anxious because I knew
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.980]   that we weren't just going to be encountering some trouble.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.500]   We're going to be encountering quite a bit of trouble.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.340]   We weren't just going to be driving or flying into the dark.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:54.260]   We were going to be flying into quite a bit of darkness and it left me anxious.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:59.700]   I felt nervous.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.940]   And as we flew forward and I looked out the window seat, for whatever reason, I decided
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:10.460]   to sit in the window seat this one time, I could see the sky beginning to get dark, the
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:17.300]   clouds beginning to roll, the rain beginning to fall, and the lightning striking in the
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.300]   distance.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.260]   And as it did, the whole plane began to shake.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.900]   Everything began to shudder.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.580]   And I could feel all of that anxiety boiling up to a breaking point within me.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:36.060]   It left me to a spot where I felt so much terror in light of the trouble.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:41.460]   And then I remembered the words of the flight attendant.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:51.140]   It may grow dark, but rest assured, the plane can handle much more than you think.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.300]   You're completely safe.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.740]   You're totally comfortable.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:00.500]   I don't know how bumpy life has gotten for you.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.700]   I don't know how much turbulence you feel like you've encountered.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:10.180]   I don't know how dark the sky seems to have grown and what sort of feelings have risen
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   up from within.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:19.540]   But what I know is that with Jesus, you're completely safe.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.300]   You're totally safe.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:30.260]   Because we have a Savior that He goes to the darkest places for the darkest people.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.500]   This is what He did for us.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.900]   We all at one time, we were dark in the understanding of our minds.
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.580]   We were enemies of God.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:45.420]   And yet Jesus, He raced into the darkness of our existence to get close to us.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:52.760]   He came to liberate a dark people, to make them sons and daughters, children of light.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:59.620]   We know that Jesus, He is the King whom our enemy cowers before.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.820]   He proved it in the fact that He came into this life, living the way that none of us
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.220]   could, living perfectly on our behalf.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.640]   And yet He died the death all of us deserved.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.820]   He hung Himself in our place and He absorbed all the shame and all the scrutiny and all
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.980]   of the punishment that was deserving us in our sin.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:29.820]   And as He endured it on our behalf, He proved through the words, "It is finished."
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.740]   That we have nothing to be intimidated by.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:39.940]   But our enemy is the one who will cower before Him, before our King who is upon His cross.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:45.380]   And we know that we have a Savior who gives destiny and He gives dignity like you wouldn't
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.380]   believe.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:54.380]   It would blow your mind because He has given you the dignity of belonging to His family,
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:42:05.620]   of being a co-heir with Him in the destiny of living with Him forevermore.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.180]   I don't know what evil you face.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.460]   I don't know how insidious your sin may be.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.740]   But what I do know is it doesn't matter how far you've fallen, the darkness that hovers
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:23.860]   overhead, none are too hopeless, none are too lost.
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:28.100]   Jesus has given everything to prove that this is true.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   The question is, like this man, will you run and will you fall before Him tonight?
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.500]   Let me pray for us.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:50.660]   God, this moment now is a moment you and I have talked a lot about.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:58.860]   And so God, I'm praying for your guidance and your leadership here.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.460]   But Lord, I don't want this to just be some lesson we've learned.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:09.620]   I want this to be a lesson that we live, God.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:17.820]   I don't just want for us to become more intellectually acquainted with truth.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:27.140]   I want us to be more intimately acquainted with you.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.860]   So help me now, God.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:41.940]   Hey, Porch, would you look up at me for a minute?
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:52.140]   We often see when we look at the Scriptures that Jesus responds to the faith He sees.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.660]   We see it over and over and over and over again throughout the Bible.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:07.160]   And yet what we know in this moment is that this man's reality, it was wracked by a sort
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.080]   of evil the likes of which he should never have engaged.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.300]   And everything about him looks like it's control possessed in this moment.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:23.520]   And yet what we know is that this man does something likely upon his own volition.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.820]   These demons, they had no reason to run to Jesus because they knew they were whipped.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:35.820]   They had no reason to come to Jesus because they knew that would be the end of their story.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.740]   So how then did this man get to the feet of Jesus?
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:50.100]   I think in faith, even the most microcosmic of faith he had, he ran.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:57.300]   Some of you here tonight, you need to run to the feet of Jesus.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.780]   And that's all you got to do.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:06.380]   We see this man, he runs and he falls and Jesus, he takes care of the rest.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.020]   Some of you need to let his story be your story.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.980]   And you need to let it happen tonight.
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.940]   Not because I'm wanting to fabricate something here.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:23.820]   Not because we're trying to create some moment that we can look back on or tell stories of.
[00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:28.380]   I think you need to do it because Christ has brought you here for that reason.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.940]   And so I don't know what the darkness is in your life.
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.300]   I don't know what the shadow of shame looks like in your story.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:40.260]   And yet we're going to respond and we're going to sing.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:48.780]   But before we do, I want to invite those of you that feel like this is your story and
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.620]   you're at a breaking point where you want things to change.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.420]   I want to invite you to come down here so that I can pray over you.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.500]   But before you do, there's also a second call to the room.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.420]   Because I think there are many of us here that are like, man, no, Jesus has liberated
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.480]   me from that.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.580]   He has delivered me from my darkness.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.460]   I live in the light now.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:14.980]   And yet what we know as his disciples, as we seek his people, that none is too far gone.
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:18.260]   None is too hopeless.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:23.340]   And so maybe if you're here and you know of someone that you've deemed too far gone, you've
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.420]   found to be hopeless in their story, that you don't know if there is room for God to
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.420]   move.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.100]   Maybe tonight is a night for you to stand in the gap on their behalf.
[00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.740]   It's to intercede in their stead.
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.180]   It's to come down here so that way we can pray for them.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:44.660]   And you can be the kind of disciple that Jesus himself has shown us to be.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:50.620]   That we would go any distance to reach the isolated, to engage the inaccessible, to save
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.620]   the sinner.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:47:00.260]   And so if you're here tonight and you want to lay the darkness down and you want to leave
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.340]   it here forevermore and you want to walk out into the light of what God has for you, I
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.860]   want to invite you to come forward.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.820]   And if you're here and you want to stand in the gap for someone else, you want to hold
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:16.820]   the ground for someone else, you feel like God has called you to be the friend that leads
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:21.740]   someone to the cross of Christ, or you believe that God's going to move in someone's story,
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:26.740]   but you want to stand as a faithful disciple in their place tonight, I want to ask you
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:27.740]   to come down too.
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.420]   This is a bold thing.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:34.780]   And I've been on the fence about doing this, but this isn't just about being the weekly
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.460]   entertainment for you.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.780]   This is about actually doing the real work.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.420]   And so if that's you, would you be willing to come down here in this moment?
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:50.340]   Would you be willing to get up and come down to the front so that we can pray for you,
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.900]   pray with you, for your friend?
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.820]   Would you be willing?
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.540]   Would you take a step of faith?
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.780]   Would you show Jesus?
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.180]   I don't just know the right things.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.140]   I will live the right things.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:03.580]   I will do the right things.
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:09.140]   I will make a move for my Savior and for my King.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.140]   Some of you are coming down.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.140]   You come down.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.820]   Please, yeah, make your way.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.860]   None's too far gone.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.340]   None is too hopeless for this moment.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.100]   Some of you, you may be with a friend here tonight.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.100]   You'll come down.
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.320]   Yeah, come on.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.540]   Some of you may have a friend here tonight that's told you, "Hey, I feel like I'm a lost
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.540]   cause.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.060]   I feel like a total outcast.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.140]   I feel like I've been abandoned by God."
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.580]   Maybe you need to be the one to grab him by the hand and say, "We're going to come down
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.580]   here together.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.580]   And we're going to pray.
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.540]   And we're going to ask God to move.
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.700]   We're going to believe that Jesus can do in your life what he has done in so many other
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.700]   people's lives."
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.240]   Y'all come down.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   You make space.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:49:03.520]   Yeah, keep coming.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   It's not too late.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.360]   Some of you are sitting here and you're thinking, "Man, I don't want to be exposed.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   I don't want to be outed.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.360]   I don't want to be seen.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.360]   I don't want to..."
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.160]   Listen, you're in good company tonight.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   Look at these friends.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.200]   Look at these brothers and sisters.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.440]   These people that want to take a stand.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.880]   That want to make a move.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:28.220]   That want to live into the kind of life that God has invited us to be a part of.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.600]   This is a chance to move and to be a part of it.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   I'm going to pray.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.920]   And what I would ask is, if you're with someone, you know, lay a hand on them.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:42.860]   And if you're in the room, would you extend a hand to the front of the stage to where
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:44.440]   these friends now are?
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   And let me pray.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.840]   God, I know my story.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:57.640]   I know how dark my days were before you.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:13.200]   But I know, Jesus, it was upon meeting you, it was when you found me that everything changed.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.840]   I know, God, that there's some people here tonight that are kneeling here before you,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.960]   that are sitting here before you.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:25.600]   And they've done so because it's a testament to the fact that, God, they don't want the
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.860]   life they've been living any longer.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.340]   They don't want to entertain the addiction any longer.
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:36.640]   They don't want to sit in the shame any longer, God.
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:41.440]   They don't want to feel the shadow of their sin any longer, God.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.840]   They don't want to feel the separation from you any longer, God.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   They found themselves in a place that they were never supposed to be in, God.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.320]   And yet, now they're here and they're saying, "No, God, I don't want this anymore.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   I want you, God.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.960]   This is a testament to my faith.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.160]   This is a demonstration of my belief in Jesus."
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.480]   You move towards those that move towards you.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.120]   Your word says you draw close to those that draw close to you.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:09.360]   And, God, they have come close tonight that you might come close to them.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:19.680]   I pray, our Defender, lift the darkness, remove the veil.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:26.600]   Free us, God, from our shame and let the flood of your forgiveness wash over us in a way
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:32.840]   that leads us to be eternally different, totally changed.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.600]   You can do it, God.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.920]   You move towards the darkest of places for the darkest of people.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.480]   Some of us are down here, God, and we've not come for ourselves.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.800]   We have come for someone else.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:51.560]   We have a friend, a sibling, a parent, a coworker, a neighbor that is lost in something that,
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.400]   God, we are praying you would deliver them out of.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:52:02.640]   And so, God, we're asking you to see the cries of your people here, to answer, God, our intercession
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:11.840]   and to liberate, God, the lives of our friends, of our family who seem too far gone, who seem
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:19.840]   totally isolated, who seem so very inaccessible, God, none is so inaccessible that you can't
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.000]   reach them.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.920]   Your hand is not too short.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   Your grace is never run dry.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:34.840]   So, God, we believe that tonight things can't change.
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.000]   We really do.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.160]   I know, God, I feel trepidation in my spirit as I pray that, God, man, it could change
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.600]   right now, that, man, I don't know, maybe tomorrow is going to be hard.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.200]   And God, that could be the case.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.920]   And yet what I know is you can do whatever you want.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.640]   Addiction can fall.
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.600]   Shame can fall.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.920]   Sickness can fall.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:04.240]   God, anything can be undone by the one that has undone the grave on our behalf.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:09.080]   And so, God, we're begging you, come, work, move in this space.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.400]   We love you, Lord.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:17.480]   We're grateful, God, that you're a good Savior and you would reach even the most unreachable
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.160]   of people, people like us.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.160]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:20.160]   Amen.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
