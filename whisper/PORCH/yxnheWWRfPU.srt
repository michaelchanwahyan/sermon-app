1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,860
 - All right, well, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,020
 Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Fayetteville, Tulsa,

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,140
 Nashville, Philadelphia, wherever you are joining,

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,020
 if you're just listening and live streaming,

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,480
 we are continuing the series, Rated R for Romance.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,820
 Let me start this way.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,460
 I've got a random kind of side hobby

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,280
 that I do from time to time called fixing up golf carts.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,380
 Here's what I mean by that.

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,780
 Every now and then on Craigslist

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,140
 or like one of these five mile or kind of resell apps,

13
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,900
 there'll be like somebody selling a golf cart

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,940
 and just through like years,

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,180
 I've kind of learned like different ways

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,020
 to kind of trick them out.

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,180
 It's like a fun random hobby.

18
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,780
 Some people, you know, like to work on things

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,380
 and build things, fix up golf carts.

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,860
 One recently I had found was in the country

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,220
 and this guy was selling a golf cart

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,740
 and was like, oh dude, I could like, you know,

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,220
 put a lift on that, that would be awesome.

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,620
 Just a little flip project on the side.

25
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,740
 And I reached out, the golf cart was available.

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,700
 So I rented a trailer and I went in

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,380
 and headed out to his home out in the country,

28
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,420
 got to his house, looked at the golf cart.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,580
 This all looks great.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,260
 And side note about the guy,

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,980
 this was like one of the more interesting interactions

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,820
 that I had.

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,900
 This dude is like in his 30s, show up to his place.

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,540
 He lives on this huge plot of land.

35
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,660
 He has an airplane strip in front of his house

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,220
 where planes get to land in front.

37
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,180
 He's got seven kids all running around,

38
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,900
 like ages 13 to two.

39
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,200
 All of them have four wheelers.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,240
 It was like, dude, where am I right now?

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,380
 And Callie, if I don't come home, they murdered me.

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,180
 And so it just was like this,

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,020
 where he's got his own pond.

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,620
 He was like, yeah, dug that pond up.

45
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,540
 And the dude was like the most he-man

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,020
 I've ever been around because at one moment,

47
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,340
 I'm looking at the golf cart and I'm like, hey,

48
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,260
 you know, part of the metal underneath this thing is bent

49
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,320
 and that's not good.

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,180
 And expecting him to be like,

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,460
 well, I'll take a couple hundred bucks off it.

52
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,260
 He's like, all right, let's take it down to the shed.

53
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,420
 Takes it down to the shed.

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,380
 Dude pulls out a straight up welder

55
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,700
 and puts the mass down and was like,

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,820
 and welds new metal onto the bottom.

57
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,660
 He was like, I'm not worthy.

58
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,500
 Okay.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,900
 And so he, you know, I ended up buying the golf cart

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,580
 and I loaded onto this trailer I'd gotten from U-Haul

61
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,020
 and it doesn't fit.

62
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,500
 And I'm like, oh no, this is not good.

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,740
 I got to leave with this thing.

64
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,580
 I've rented it.

65
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,400
 I'm like over an hour out here.

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
 What am I going to do?

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,060
 And the guy's like, oh, you know,

68
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,900
 I'll just give you some rope.

69
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,400
 We can tie it down and it'll be fine.

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,320
 And I'm like, oh, that's great.

71
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,080
 He hands me the rope and then it hits me.

72
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,660
 And this moment I've experienced a lot of times

73
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,960
 where I begin to think,

74
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,540
 I don't know what type of knot to tie here.

75
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,920
 Like I didn't, I wasn't a boy scout

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
 and some of you guys were Eagle Scouts and you're like,

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
 oh, well, here's what you got to do there.

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
 And you know exactly what to tie.

79
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
 But I was like, I'm the kind of guy that just ends up

80
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,080
 like being like, oh man, I'm just going to rope this around

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,500
 like 15 different times and pull really hard.

82
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,560
 Hopefully that'll hold.

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
 And I'm like thinking through there and I'm like, yeah,

84
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,240
 what kind of knot would you tie?

85
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,080
 He man.

86
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,920
 And he's like, oh, and he uses some term.

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,360
 And I'm like, it's like, you know,

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
 I would do a square double back fender.

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,400
 And I'm like, yeah, square double back fender, right.

90
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,320
 I don't really like my square double back fender.

91
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,480
 What's yours look like?

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,780
 Maybe I could check out how you do yours, make sure.

93
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,520
 And eventually I just give him my man card

94
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,660
 and I'm like, here, just take it.

95
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,040
 And can you tie a knot on this golf cart

96
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,500
 and tie it to the trailer?

97
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,360
 Because one thing I don't want to happen

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
 is for me to just out of pride,

99
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,600
 end up tying some janky knot that's like, you know,

100
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,360
 here's the bunny ears and pull.

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
 And it ends up having a golf cart fly off a trailer

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,680
 on the highway at like 70 miles an hour.

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
 So he ties up this different knot and everything goes fine.

104
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,120
 Now, what does that have to do with rated R for romance

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
 or relationship goals?

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,920
 Well, in that scenario,

107
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
 I knew that something valuable was at stake.

108
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,640
 So risking tying a knot that wouldn't hold

109
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,320
 would come undone with something that I didn't want to do.

110
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,680
 And in the same way, we have a term

111
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,480
 for marriage and relationships

112
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,880
 that is very similar to the scenario I was in there.

113
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,120
 We call it tying the knot.

114
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
 And people come together

115
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,600
 and they tie the knot in relationships

116
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,420
 and they get married.

117
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,920
 You've probably heard this phrase before of,

118
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,200
 hey, when did you tie the knot?

119
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,400
 Or hey, we're gonna tie the knot.

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
 And people form a relationship and they date

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,480
 and then they get married and they tie the knot.

122
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,080
 But tragically, about half of the knots that are tied

123
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,480
 end up unraveling and coming apart.

124
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,560
 And so how can you and I be people who know

125
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,780
 that we're stepping in the direction of tying a knot

126
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,240
 that will last all of this life?

127
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,880
 That we're not gonna end up like a statistic

128
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,060
 and be a part of tying the knot with someone else

129
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,060
 and years later, it just begins to unravel together.

130
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,160
 And one of the reasons I think

131
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,480
 why so many people come together

132
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
 and they form this relationship

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
 and they make this promise and they stand

134
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,840
 on their wedding day and they pledge

135
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,960
 'til death do us part and they tie the knot

136
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,440
 and then months, years,

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,360
 a fixed amount of time or a certain amount of time later,

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,820
 they end up standing in front of that person

139
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,000
 and they're signing divorce papers.

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,100
 Saying, I never want you in my life again.

141
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,420
 Because their knot was not strong enough to hold.

142
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,480
 And as tragic as it would be to tie a knot

143
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,120
 that ends up having a golf cart fly off of a trailer,

144
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,680
 infinitely more tragic is tying a relationship knot

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,280
 and marriage that ends up falling apart.

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,320
 Like you can get another golf cart,

147
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
 you can get another trailer,

148
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,860
 you don't get another shot at your first marriage.

149
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,000
 You don't get another shot at your 20s,

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,680
 you don't get another shot at your dating,

151
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,960
 at your love life, even your soul.

152
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,200
 And the way that romance and sex and love impacts it.

153
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
 And the God who's there doesn't want you

154
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,160
 to go through not knowing how to tie

155
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,880
 and move towards one another and create a bond

156
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,980
 and create a knot that will last,

157
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,640
 that nothing in this life will be able to tear apart.

158
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,400
 But it's not gonna happen by you doing it

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,560
 on your own opinion or following how you think it's best.

160
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,460
 Just like in that scenario,

161
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,200
 I knew that if I go based on how I think

162
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,080
 I should tie the knot,

163
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,800
 it could have very big consequences and tragic ones.

164
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,800
 Or I could say, you know how to tie knots, he-man.

165
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,840
 You tie the knot.

166
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,720
 And the God who's there is saying,

167
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
 are you gonna try to do this on your own?

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,520
 And if so, you risk becoming a liability

169
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,680
 or becoming another statistic

170
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,960
 'cause your knot's gonna unravel.

171
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,520
 Or you can trust the God who's there who says,

172
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,960
 I know how to tie knots, I created marriage,

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,780
 I know how to best move towards a relationship

174
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,080
 that will last.

175
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,360
 So tonight, we are gonna talk about dating,

176
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
 the dating phase and how to move,

177
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,420
 'cause the dating phase is kinda moving your relationship

178
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,940
 in the direction of creating a knot and a bond

179
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,600
 that will never be able to separate or come apart.

180
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,960
 And so we're gonna explore what it looks like

181
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,160
 to date well, to begin to form the relationships.

182
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,000
 'Cause one of the reasons why knots end up unraveling

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,620
 is because of dating so poorly.

184
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,480
 And we are exploring in the book of Song of Solomon,

185
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,140
 the second phase in this couple's relationship.

186
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,180
 So if you weren't here last week

187
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,240
 you can go to iTunes or go to Spotify,

188
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
 you can check out the podcast and what you missed.

189
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,940
 But we opened up the book of Song of Solomon.

190
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,880
 Song of Solomon is one of the most risque books

191
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,780
 in all the Bible.

192
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,580
 It's an exploration of a man and a woman

193
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,540
 and their marriage and their sexuality

194
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,540
 and their love and romance for each other.

195
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,320
 If you thought God was against sex or romance,

196
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
 you were wrong.

197
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,040
 He created it and he even included

198
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,780
 an entire book of the Bible

199
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,540
 that is all about his celebration

200
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,940
 and this couple's exploration of love, romance

201
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,080
 and each other in sex.

202
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,300
 It's so risque that we said last week

203
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,220
 Hebrew boys and girls were not able to read this book

204
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,260
 until they were 30 or married

205
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,400
 because rabbis were like,

206
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,260
 "Dude, that is gonna make everybody hot and bothered.

207
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,600
 "We need to just keep that from them until they're married."

208
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,840
 And it's a beautiful picture of this relationship

209
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,720
 that God just celebrates and he keeps in the Bible.

210
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,460
 So to review, it reads a little bit,

211
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,760
 it's a song called Song of Solomon

212
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,920
 and it reads a little bit like Shakespearean poetry

213
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,820
 and in it there's a Romeo and a Juliet.

214
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,060
 There's a man and a woman.

215
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,520
 Last week, they kind of began to form

216
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,180
 their initial relationships and sparks of attraction

217
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,000
 and this week, we're gonna catch up

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,740
 as they continue their relationship

219
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,380
 and we're gonna see them go from increasing amounts

220
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,560
 of intimacy and deepening in their relationship

221
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,660
 and all the way at the end of tonight,

222
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,960
 they're gonna get engaged.

223
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,320
 And so we're gonna explore three things

224
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,880
 that every healthy dating relationship

225
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,500
 should include as a part of them.

226
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,840
 That every healthy dating relationship

227
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,160
 should have progressing, expressing

228
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,720
 and addressing involved in certain areas.

229
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,000
 Progressing, expressing and addressing.

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,520
 So we're gonna unpack exactly what those are

231
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,760
 but let me read the verses first

232
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,160
 and then we'll dive into exactly them.

233
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,300
 So this comes from Song of Solomon, chapter two, verse eight.

234
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,580
 The woman speaking, she says, "Listen, my beloved, look.

235
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,440
 "Here he comes leaping across the mountains

236
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,500
 "and bounding over the hills.

237
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,140
 "My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag."

238
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,260
 She's basically like, look, my boy is a stud.

239
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,680
 "Look, there he stands behind our wall,

240
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,580
 "gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice."

241
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,380
 I'll explain what exactly is going on there.

242
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,380
 "My beloved spoke to me and he said,"

243
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,140
 here's what he says, "Arise, my darling,

244
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,340
 "my beautiful one, come with me.

245
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,780
 "See, the winter has passed and the rains are over.

246
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,920
 "Flowers appear on the earth.

247
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,620
 "The season of singing has come, spring.

248
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,420
 "The cooing of doves is heard in our land.

249
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,300
 "The fig tree forms its early fruit.

250
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,160
 "Blossoming vines spread their fragrance.

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,940
 "Arise, come, my darling, my beautiful one,

252
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,640
 "come with me into this new season.

253
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,620
 "My dove," him speaking, that's his girl,

254
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,720
 "in the clefts of the rock,

255
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,960
 "in the hiding places of the mountain,

256
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,660
 "come out from hiding and show me your face.

257
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,220
 "Let me hear your voice,

258
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,580
 "for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely."

259
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,260
 They both speak in verse 15.

260
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,380
 "Catch the foxes for us,

261
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,740
 "the little foxes that could ruin the vineyards

262
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,240
 "or our relationship,

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,180
 "because our vineyards or our relationship is in bloom."

264
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,100
 And she says, "My beloved is mine and I'm his.

265
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,860
 "He browses among the lilies.

266
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,820
 "Until the day breaks and the shadows flee,

267
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,760
 "turn, my beloved," she's talking about her boo,

268
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,580
 "and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the rugged hills."

269
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,260
 Rugged hills, interesting side note.

270
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,240
 If you have the NA, or different translations

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,380
 translate these different words or different ways.

272
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,460
 If you have the NASB, which is just another translation,

273
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,940
 you have beether hills inside of there.

274
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,740
 Or rugged mountains is another word.

275
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,980
 Beether, and the beether mountains is something that,

276
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,520
 there's no place on earth called the beether mountains.

277
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
 What are they saying?

278
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,100
 Beether is a word that means cleavage.

279
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,600
 So she is saying, come, this girl is,

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,700
 she is getting excited about the next chapter,

281
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,860
 which is the wedding night,

282
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,820
 and she's beginning to talk about,

283
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,000
 "Hey dude, come all night long.

284
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,040
 "That's until the shadows flee and the morning breaks.

285
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,340
 "And I want you to play on the mountains of cleavage.

286
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,340
 "I want you to play with my breasts," is what she says.

287
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,540
 It's in your Bible.

288
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,580
 Some of you guys are like,

289
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,000
 man, I've got my memory verse picked out for this week.

290
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,460
 (congregation laughing)

291
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,700
 All night long, she has,

292
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,500
 she then goes into like this nightmare she has.

293
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,900
 "All night long I was on my bed,

294
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,980
 "yearning for the one that my heart loves.

295
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,580
 "I looked for him, but I did not find him.

296
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,440
 "I will get up and I will go about the city."

297
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,340
 So she begins to explain this nightmare she's having.

298
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,400
 "Through its streets and its squares,

299
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,940
 "I will search for the one whom my heart loves.

300
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,200
 "So I looked for him, but I did not find him.

301
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,280
 "The watchman found me as they made the rounds in the city

302
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,780
 "and I said, 'Have you seen the one my heart loves?'

303
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,020
 "Scarcely had I passed them

304
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,420
 "when I found the one my heart loves.

305
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,640
 "And I held him and I would not let him go

306
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,360
 "till I brought him into my mother's house,

307
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,900
 "to the room of the one who conceived me,

308
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,420
 "the most intimate part of my life.

309
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,640
 "Daughters of Jerusalem,

310
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,860
 "I charge you by the gazelles and the does of the field,

311
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,940
 "do not arouse or awaken love until it's time."

312
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,940
 So as hot and bothered as she is, she still says,

313
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,700
 "Do not introduce sex until it's time."

314
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,980
 There's three things I wanna pull out

315
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,240
 from this couple and their relationship that are growing

316
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,980
 that are so relevant to you if you're dating,

317
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,740
 so relevant if you ever have a dating relationship.

318
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,380
 And if these are not a part of your dating relationship,

319
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,060
 you should be concerned.

320
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,020
 The first one is that if you are in a relationship,

321
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,160
 it should be a relationship

322
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,860
 that is progressing towards marriage.

323
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,220
 Now let me read verses eight through 13 again.

324
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,580
 She says, "Hey, listen, my beloved.

325
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,360
 "Here he comes, leaping over the mountains,

326
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,460
 "bounding over the hills.

327
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,200
 "He's like a gazelle, young stat.

328
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,300
 "He stands there behind our wall."

329
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,580
 She's speaking metaphorically.

330
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,740
 There's a wall of separation.

331
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,820
 And he's gazing through the windows,

332
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,140
 peering through the lattice.

333
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,340
 He desires to move closer and progress towards each other

334
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,940
 in the relationship.

335
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,900
 And then it says that he speaks to her and he says,

336
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,780
 "Arise, my darling, beautiful, and come with me.

337
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,600
 "The winter is past and spring is here.

338
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,920
 "There's a new season and I want you to come with me

339
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,700
 "into this next season of life."

340
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,520
 He says, "The rains are over, flowers appear on the earth.

341
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,900
 "The season of singing has come.

342
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,980
 "Cooing of doves is heard on our land."

343
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,540
 He's pointing to spring being here.

344
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,260
 Essentially like that idea of ring by spring.

345
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,880
 He's saying, "Hey, girl, I want you to come with me

346
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,620
 "into this next season of life.

347
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,060
 "I want us to progress forward."

348
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,460
 If you were in a dating relationship,

349
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,580
 and healthy dating relationships

350
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,220
 involve your relationship progressing towards marriage.

351
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,680
 In other words, it's not just stagnant.

352
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,860
 It doesn't just stay there.

353
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,340
 Your relationship is going somewhere.

354
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,740
 If you were perpetually waiting

355
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,220
 and you're perpetually just kind of in the,

356
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,300
 man, we've been dating for six years.

357
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,620
 You should be concerned.

358
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,640
 You should break up.

359
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,380
 You should move on and be honest enough with one another.

360
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,220
 You should be progressing somewhere.

361
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,940
 Dating is meant to be a path that leads towards a promise.

362
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,380
 That's marriage that leads towards a lifelong pursuit.

363
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,780
 It's not just meant to be this dating.

364
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,940
 It's not just similar to essentially this.

365
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,100
 Dating is meant to involve you going in

366
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,380
 and you begin to say, "Is this someone

367
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,060
 "that I can move towards the destination of marriage with?"

368
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,300
 The end goal is not dating.

369
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,940
 The end goal is moving towards marriage.

370
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,740
 The dating is almost like going to the airport.

371
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,220
 The airport is not a place that anyone wants to go

372
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,020
 to hang out or anyone wants to spend a lot of time.

373
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,500
 The only reason you go to the airport

374
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,940
 is not to hang out at the airport

375
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,220
 unless you need counseling.

376
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,600
 Because the reason you go to the airport

377
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,920
 is to go to your destination.

378
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,940
 I mean, you go through security

379
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,180
 and you go when you're in there and you're sitting there.

380
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,380
 It's not because you're like, "Oh, this is great.

381
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,760
 "I love how the airport feels and it smells and security.

382
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,200
 "Love taking off the old belt and hanging out in here.

383
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,140
 "And I love that everything is priced

384
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,380
 "like 10 times more than the rest of the world.

385
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,660
 "So a banana is a quarter out there.

386
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,900
 "It's $6 in here."

387
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,420
 What is wrong with you people?

388
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,700
 You only go to the airport

389
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,440
 in order to move to another destination.

390
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,100
 Dating is not the destination.

391
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,220
 Dating is like the airport.

392
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,880
 And just like you don't casually go hang out at the airport,

393
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,380
 you don't casually go date

394
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,540
 unless you are ready to move in the direction of marriage.

395
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,860
 That if you are dating

396
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,140
 and it's not for the intent of getting married,

397
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,740
 you should break up.

398
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
 You are playing with fire.

399
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,420
 You are playing with emotions and heart level

400
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,140
 in a way that God never created you

401
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,180
 to have intimacy with someone.

402
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,980
 Emotional, spiritual, physical,

403
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,620
 in an exclusive way

404
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,820
 that didn't have the purpose

405
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,620
 of us moving towards marriage someday.

406
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,660
 And just like it is expensive to hang out

407
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,940
 or everything costs more

408
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,860
 the more that you hang out at the airport,

409
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,740
 it is an expensive thing to begin to spend time

410
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,460
 in a dating relationship, giving your heart

411
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,300
 and then ripping it apart from someone.

412
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,620
 You are not meant to spend a season

413
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,180
 or extended season of aimlessly dating without a purpose.

414
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,900
 You are to be moving in the direction.

415
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,860
 This relationship is moving towards marriage.

416
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,820
 And if you're not in a place

417
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,700
 where you are ready to say like,

418
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,580
 "Man, I could be married in the next year,"

419
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,820
 you should not be dating.

420
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,580
 It's been said that dating without the intent of marriage

421
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,260
 is like going shopping with no money.

422
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,820
 You will either leave frustrated,

423
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,300
 everything that you see are frustrated,

424
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,420
 or you're gonna steal something that doesn't belong to you.

425
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,780
 If you date without the intent of marriage,

426
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,500
 you are setting yourself up to end up frustrated

427
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,980
 and discouraged and angry and hurt by how it went,

428
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,100
 or you're gonna steal something that doesn't belong to you.

429
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,220
 Part of the other person's heart, their sexual purity,

430
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,820
 you're gonna end up taking something that is not yours.

431
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,020
 And so if you are not at a place

432
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,860
 where you can honestly say,

433
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,900
 "Man, I want this relationship to progress."

434
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,540
 It's not just kind of hanging out for years

435
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,460
 or with no purpose, and it's aimlessly.

436
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,540
 If I'm stuck in a holding pattern, you should break up.

437
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,100
 So let me give specifically, really quickly, the timeline.

438
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,940
 Here's what it should look like.

439
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,060
 Here's the progression.

440
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,420
 Should start with singleness.

441
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,140
 You're single, they're single.

442
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,900
 You're single well, you're healthy,

443
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,180
 you're in a season where you're like,

444
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,620
 "Man, I feel like I could be married in the next year."

445
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,660
 I'm not saying I will,

446
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,940
 but you're not 14 in middle school,

447
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,660
 and you're not in a place where you're like,

448
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,020
 "You know, I need to finish school.

449
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,960
 "I need to finish law school, and I've got three more years,

450
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,180
 "and I'm definitely not getting married

451
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,140
 "until I get done with that."

452
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,260
 You should not date,

453
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,020
 because you are setting yourself up to fail.

454
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,660
 You're gonna date for three years?

455
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,940
 You weren't made to be with someone

456
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,540
 that you increasingly grow emotionally

457
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,780
 and physically attracted to,

458
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,020
 and you just want to be together for three years.

459
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,860
 So you're either gonna cross boundaries physically,

460
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,620
 or if you don't have any desire to move further

461
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,780
 in the relationship, that's probably concerning too.

462
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,780
 You're like, "This is great.

463
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,800
 "We're just friends, and I love being with her.

464
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,520
 "No real anything there, but this is great.

465
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,780
 "We're in this dating relationship."

466
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,300
 You should be concerned there.

467
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,720
 And so if you're not in a place where you're like,

468
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,780
 "Man, I really could see myself

469
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,860
 "entering the next season of life,"

470
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,100
 then you should not be dating.

471
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,940
 But let's say you are.

472
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,020
 So you're single, they're single.

473
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,980
 Here's what happens next.

474
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,140
 A date.

475
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,700
 A date happens where the guy comes up,

476
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,520
 and he initiates the date, and he goes up and says,

477
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,860
 "I would like to take you out for blank."

478
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,020
 Maybe it's dinner.

479
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,540
 The guy initiates and says,

480
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,220
 "I would like to ask you out on a date."

481
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,020
 Now the girl either reciprocates with a,

482
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,660
 "Yes, I'd like to do that," or you say, "No.

483
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,340
 "I would not like to go on a date with you."

484
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,100
 But the guy initiates, and you may be wondering,

485
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,200
 "I thought we said girls could kinda

486
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,380
 "put themselves out there."

487
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,820
 We'll even bring more clarity to that

488
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,140
 in the Q and A after this.

489
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,160
 But sure, there's a way in which you could strategically

490
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,300
 put yourself in the presence of godly men.

491
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,100
 But the Bible says men are called to lead

492
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,540
 in 1 Corinthians 11, Genesis 2,

493
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,580
 that God created men to initiate and to lead.

494
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,940
 So men, you go up, here's what you're gonna do.

495
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
 You're gonna use your words, you're gonna ask her,

496
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
 "I'd like to go on a date with you,"

497
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,980
 or, "I'd like to go to dinner with you,"

498
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,940
 or, "I have tickets to a Mavs game,

499
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,600
 "and I would love you to come with me.

500
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,820
 "I'd love to spend time with you."

501
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,180
 You initiate, you ask.

502
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,640
 You risk rejection.

503
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,240
 That's what you do.

504
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,100
 And you risk rejection.

505
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,380
 And so could you be rejected?

506
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,220
 Yes.

507
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,180
 And you know what happens?

508
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,300
 If you're a godly guy, and you ask out a godly girl,

509
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,140
 and she rejects you, dude, I am so proud of you.

510
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,820
 I mean it.

511
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,180
 Because you are doing what men do, you step up.

512
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,740
 Do you only wanna do things in life

513
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,540
 where you only do 'em if you know that you won't fail?

514
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,380
 Really?

515
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,740
 You're like, "Yeah, I would ask out her.

516
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,620
 "She would be awesome.

517
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,920
 "I just feel like she'd be great.

518
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,180
 "But I'll settle with this girl,

519
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,820
 "'cause for sure she's gonna date me."

520
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,020
 You really wanna live like that?

521
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,180
 (congregation laughing)

522
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,660
 Like, be courageous.

523
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,500
 Go ask.

524
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 And if you get rejected, dude, high five.

525
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,420
 I'm proud of you.

526
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,260
 Way to go.

527
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,660
 And girls, here's what I would say.

528
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,820
 If he's a godly guy, you should go on a date with him.

529
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,180
 If he's a godly guy, and you're a godly girl,

530
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,100
 you should go on a date with him.

531
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,780
 Guys, so they initiate.

532
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,100
 I would plan something fun,

533
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,340
 because if you have a boring date,

534
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,940
 it'll be hard to determine, are they boring?

535
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,500
 Is the date boring, or am I boring?

536
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,020
 And so I would plan something that's somewhat engaging

537
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,740
 and fun where you can talk together.

538
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,940
 This is my opinion.

539
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,140
 I think, girls and guys,

540
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,340
 you should give each other a chance of two dates.

541
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,180
 Why?

542
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
 Because if you have one dud date,

543
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,380
 and you're like, we got coffee and just sat there,

544
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,660
 and they were having a bad day,

545
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,820
 you may not have a great read.

546
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
 That's just my opinion.

547
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,220
 Wouldn't die on that hill.

548
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,660
 But, guys initiate, you ask them on a date.

549
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,500
 So let's say they say yes, you go on that date,

550
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,340
 it's great, everything's going fine.

551
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,060
 You end up going on another one.

552
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,500
 You communicate, I'd love to take you on a second date.

553
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,020
 Girls, if you don't wanna go on a second date,

554
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,100
 you don't say, yeah, that's great,

555
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,060
 and then just fall off the face of the earth

556
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,020
 and ignore them.

557
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,180
 You say, thanks so much,

558
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,700
 I wouldn't like to go on a second date.

559
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,860
 Same thing if it's a third.

560
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,460
 Thanks so much, I wouldn't like to go on a third date

561
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,940
 if you end up going on a second.

562
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,220
 But at some point, if the relationship progresses,

563
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,860
 then you move from single to dating,

564
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,420
 or a date to dating.

565
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,580
 And it goes from a noun, date, to verb, dating.

566
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,420
 And the way that you get there is guys,

567
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,620
 you sit them down, and you have what's called a DTR.

568
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,180
 You define the relationship.

569
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,880
 You say, I would like for you, thank you.

570
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,780
 See, look, there's girls clapping in here

571
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,620
 because so few men actually do this.

572
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,620
 If you do it, you automatically are in the top 10%, okay?

573
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,180
 So, wow.

574
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,140
 Wow.

575
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,980
 For real, dude, that is easy.

576
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,100
 You're gonna get married, and I want credit, okay?

577
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,940
 Here's what you do.

578
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,760
 All right, you sit them down, and you're like,

579
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,420
 I have really enjoyed spending time with you,

580
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,620
 and you just tell them the truth.

581
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
 I'm not sure that we're going to get married,

582
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,780
 but you're at least the type of person or woman

583
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,100
 I would like to marry someday,

584
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,060
 and I would like to continue dating

585
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,900
 and pursuing you in a relationship,

586
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,740
 and I'd like you to be my girlfriend.

587
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,100
 You use the word girlfriend.

588
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,060
 That's a big deal.

589
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,380
 May not be a big deal to you, big deal to her.

590
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,020
 You drive clarity into the relationship.

591
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,420
 Leaders remove confusion,

592
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
 and let me just give you a heads up, guys.

593
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,880
 I know it, 'cause I am a guy, and I is one,

594
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
 and I've been there.

595
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,500
 This is gonna be a really awkward conversation.

596
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,340
 You're gonna sit there.

597
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,700
 It's gonna be out front of her house in the car,

598
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,500
 or maybe it's out here on the patio.

599
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,140
 We're all gonna see you tonight as we walk by,

600
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,780
 and two of you are standing there,

601
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,740
 and you're gonna sit there, and you're gonna go,

602
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,940
 you know, like he was talking about tonight and talk.

603
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,900
 (audience laughing)

604
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,740
 I really would like to spend intentional time

605
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,580
 getting to know you,

606
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,140
 and I don't know if I'm gonna marry you,

607
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,500
 but you're the type of person I'd like to marry,

608
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,780
 and I would love to move this relationship

609
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,820
 and continue growing and call you my girlfriend.

610
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
 Are you okay with that?

611
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,140
 It's gonna feel awkward.

612
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,460
 You're gonna trip over your words.

613
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,820
 It's gonna feel like you went back to middle school,

614
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,220
 and your voice is gonna be cracking,

615
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,920
 and you're doing it right,

616
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,580
 and you're driving for clarity,

617
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,660
 and you're caring for her,

618
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,780
 and you're removing confusion,

619
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,780
 and girls, you honestly answer if you're there,

620
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,580
 and if you're not, you just say, I'm not there yet,

621
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,820
 or I don't see this relationship moving forward.

622
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,980
 Thank you for the way that you've honored me,

623
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,500
 and I don't have any interest in moving forward right now.

624
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,260
 You don't blame it on God.

625
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,320
 You don't blame it on anybody else.

626
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,100
 You speak honestly.

627
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,240
 So there, you're dating.

628
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,820
 So in the dating relationship,

629
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,100
 there's a couple things that this couple,

630
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,380
 as they are moving towards their relationship together,

631
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,260
 they model should be a part of your dating relationship.

632
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,540
 Let me just say one more side note.

633
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,500
 At some point, and this is for extra credit, guys,

634
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,140
 I'm talking the top 1%, men,

635
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,180
 if you are dating a girl, and her parents are Christian,

636
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,860
 I think it is a great idea for you

637
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,500
 in the midst of this early dating stages

638
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,300
 for you to meet with her father or her mother,

639
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,740
 if she's a believer, and just clearly articulate,

640
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,860
 hey, I'm interested in dating and pursuing your daughter.

641
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,400
 I'm not sure that we're gonna get married,

642
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
 but here are my intentions.

643
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,000
 I want to pursue her towards marriage,

644
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,620
 and whether or not God has that, I'm not sure,

645
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,360
 but I promise I'm gonna honor her and care for her

646
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,100
 and pursue purity with her.

647
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,440
 Here's my phone number.

648
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,540
 You can call me anytime you'd like,

649
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,980
 and I'll communicate along the way.

650
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,060
 At least you should do that before you get engaged.

651
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,720
 And so, but in the midst of the dating relationship,

652
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,060
 I think that's a great practice,

653
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,740
 especially if she has believer parents or Christian,

654
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,780
 Christian parents as part of it.

655
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,760
 So in the dating relationship, so back to our couple,

656
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,380
 they're dating one another, they're hanging out,

657
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,120
 and he begins to say something to her

658
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,760
 that articulates something so huge

659
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,140
 that a part of your relationship,

660
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,580
 if you're gonna have a healthy dating relationship,

661
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,980
 on this journey, should involve, and he says this.

662
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,100
 My dove, we said last week, he's not just saying,

663
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,260
 like, look, bird girl.

664
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,620
 He's saying, doves only have the ability

665
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,020
 to focus on one thing at a time.

666
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,500
 So he's saying, like, man, you got eyes for me,

667
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,560
 I got eyes for you.

668
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,620
 My dove in the clefts of the rock

669
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,380
 are hiding behind the rocks on the mountain,

670
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,700
 in the hiding places on the mountainside.

671
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,460
 Show me your face.

672
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,060
 Let me hear your voice.

673
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,740
 Come out from hiding and communicate with me.

674
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,580
 Speak with me.

675
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,700
 Your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.

676
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,620
 I wanna see you.

677
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,260
 Come out from hiding and speak with me,

678
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,780
 and let me see you are, who you are.

679
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,300
 The second part of your relationship

680
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,680
 is that at some point, it should involve

681
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,820
 expressing deep, heart-level things to that person.

682
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,140
 Will you come out from hiding?

683
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,980
 That's what he says to the girl.

684
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,540
 He says, I want you to come out from hiding,

685
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,440
 and I want you to come speak with me.

686
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,820
 Come out into the open,

687
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,460
 and share about the things that are in your heart,

688
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,820
 and share about the things that are in your life,

689
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,500
 and speak, your voice is beautiful.

690
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,820
 I want you to come out from hiding.

691
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,020
 At some point in your relationship, as it progresses,

692
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,460
 you should begin to express, at a heart level,

693
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,460
 just the things in your past, things that you fear,

694
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,180
 things that you hope for,

695
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,500
 some of the ways that you just have scars

696
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,620
 from not living in line with God's best,

697
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,820
 that you bring out into the open,

698
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,280
 your story with that other person.

699
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,980
 Hopefully, you're already doing this in community

700
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,880
 with other believers, but before you get married

701
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,980
 to that person, you should do what this couple does,

702
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,900
 which is come out from hiding and speak tenderly

703
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,060
 and express your heart to that other person.

704
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,860
 It's a question we get so common, which is like,

705
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,540
 hey, when do I talk about my sexual past?

706
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,140
 When do I talk about my history, my problems, my pains?

707
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,260
 And here's the answer, you ready?

708
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,760
 When do I bring this stuff up?

709
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,820
 When you're ready to move the relationship

710
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,780
 to the next level.

711
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,860
 Like, in other words, this is not something,

712
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,380
 you know, like on the first day, you're like,

713
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,700
 yeah, I'm gonna take this soup,

714
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,560
 and here's my biggest struggle in life, and,

715
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,660
 (congregation laughing)

716
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,100
 that I wouldn't introduce that day one.

717
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,800
 I wouldn't introduce that day five, but at some point,

718
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,620
 you owe it to the person you're dating, like,

719
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,120
 man, here's the things in my past,

720
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
 here's the things that are a part of my story.

721
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,460
 Here's some of the wounds that I had growing up.

722
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,620
 And when is when you're ready to see the relationship

723
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,580
 go to the next level.

724
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,260
 When you're considering engagement,

725
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,180
 you should share that stuff.

726
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,100
 What kind of things should I share?

727
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,260
 Things that involve, man, some of the relational baggage

728
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,520
 or sexual past.

729
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,980
 Like, man, here's kind of some of my story.

730
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,580
 You don't need a glory in it or honor it.

731
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,220
 You're just kind of bringing it in the open.

732
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,060
 Here's what you should know.

733
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,540
 If there's a sexually transmitted disease,

734
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,900
 here's what you should know.

735
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,500
 Things that, I mean, one way, honestly, you should share

736
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,780
 is like, whatever you're afraid of sharing,

737
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,340
 you probably should share that.

738
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,460
 And I'm not saying early in the relationship

739
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,140
 or as this thing is blossoming.

740
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,340
 I'm saying before you get engaged,

741
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,620
 or if you're like, man, we're in that season,

742
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,820
 I wanna get more serious.

743
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,460
 One of the best things about merge,

744
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,580
 which is our premarital ministry,

745
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,620
 is it drives these types of conversations to happen.

746
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,540
 But before you enter into that season,

747
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,860
 you should have a season where you're expressing

748
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,780
 that stuff in your life.

749
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,240
 In general, just expressing kind of your past,

750
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,620
 what your upbringing was like, what shaped you,

751
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,940
 where you're carrying wounds.

752
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,300
 If your parents divorce, just things where you're,

753
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,900
 man, this really impacted and shaped my life.

754
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,500
 Met my hopes, like, this is what I hope to happen.

755
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,820
 These are my fears about what may happen.

756
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,260
 That you're sharing and speaking

757
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,340
 and communicating those things.

758
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,740
 Another way of saying it, to use that airport analogy,

759
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,780
 is, dude, before you move into engagement

760
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,760
 or before you take off, you should check your bags

761
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,700
 and check their bags and make sure you know

762
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,160
 what you are walking into together

763
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,900
 and that you share those things, how much debt you have.

764
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,400
 I remember having this conversation with my wife

765
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,080
 and just sitting down and talking about just father wounds

766
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,180
 and being raised pretty much by a single mother

767
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,140
 or father who wasn't present around

768
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,940
 and fear of, man, not being the dad that I want to be

769
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,060
 'cause I didn't have that there.

770
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,820
 Sharing about my sexual past.

771
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,380
 Sharing just about the story that God had written in my life.

772
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,460
 And as terrifying as it is, what is amazing

773
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,900
 is what happens often is we're so afraid,

774
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
 like, man, this person is gonna reject me.

775
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,380
 And oftentimes, the opposite happens,

776
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,200
 where they go, dude, thank you for sharing.

777
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,040
 Now I know everything and I'm not going anywhere.

778
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,960
 And that fear all of a sudden turns to confidence

779
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,960
 and intimacy and it's like, man, I'm even more confident.

780
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
 We should move forward into the next step.

781
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,800
 But at some point, your relationship,

782
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,880
 a healthy dating relationship, should involve you sharing

783
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
 and not glorifying sin and doing it in a way

784
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,080
 that honors and cares about her.

785
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,000
 And so you don't need to go into all the types of details

786
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,620
 of like, this is what I did with Becky.

787
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,260
 And you don't need to go very, like, hyper-specific.

788
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,160
 And if you're a girl and you're going,

789
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,460
 no, I wanna know exactly what you did with Becky,

790
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,800
 you probably should slow down, girl,

791
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,620
 and just check whatever's in your heart

792
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,860
 that may be feeding that, but doing it in a way

793
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,500
 that honors the Lord and honors this person

794
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,780
 and just comes out into the open.

795
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,120
 And he says, my dove, come out, communicate with me.

796
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,300
 Come out of hiding.

797
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,960
 I wanna see who you are.

798
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,540
 The Bible says that in Genesis chapter two,

799
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,220
 God's design for marriage was that Adam and Eve

800
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,260
 were naked and without shame.

801
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,560
 I see all that you are, and I'm not going anywhere.

802
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,420
 And I love you.

803
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,940
 And the direction and destination that God wants for you

804
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,880
 in marriage involves that.

805
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,140
 And you owe it to that person before you move

806
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,620
 into the next season of sharing who you are.

807
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,020
 And if they don't accept you for who you are, move on.

808
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,000
 Because they don't have the heart of Christ

809
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,120
 who accepts all of us and accepted all of us

810
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
 as who we are, despite all of it.

811
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,840
 And they may not be at a place where they're mature enough

812
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,080
 to see and do that and move past that.

813
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,360
 The third quality that we see from this relationship

814
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,640
 is that they involve addressing

815
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
 their specific relationship issues.

816
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,680
 Verse 15 of chapter two.

817
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,300
 They both chime in and say, catch the foxes.

818
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,900
 The little foxes that ruin the vineyards.

819
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,660
 Our vineyards are our relationship,

820
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,500
 is what they're talking about, that are in bloom.

821
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,580
 So hey, our relationship is growing,

822
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,500
 it's flourishing, and it's growing up.

823
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
 Catch the foxes that could hurt and destroy

824
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,580
 this growing relationship from getting

825
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,060
 to where it ultimately desires to go to.

826
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,140
 Like hey, cut off anything that's gonna hurt our intimacy.

827
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,760
 What was the foxes, what is he talking about?

828
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,100
 Foxes in vineyards today, even in Napa Valley,

829
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,080
 this still happens, where foxes will come up

830
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,040
 and they will basically, in a vineyard,

831
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,360
 they're growing grapes, and those grapes

832
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,740
 will start as a bud.

833
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,720
 And at the beginning of the spring season,

834
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,320
 those buds will form and foxes will come along

835
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,760
 and they will eat those buds before they ever flourish

836
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,480
 or bloom into grapes.

837
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,280
 The foxes will show up and they'll kind of cut them off

838
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,920
 before they ever grow into what they were intended

839
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,760
 to grow into.

840
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,160
 She's basically saying, and he's basically saying,

841
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,640
 hey, let's catch and kill anything that's gonna hurt

842
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,920
 our relationship from growing further.

843
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,040
 And intimacy, anything that's gonna hurt our relationship.

844
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,960
 Your third idea, the third part of your relationship

845
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,720
 should be a relationship involving addressing your issues,

846
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,840
 addressing your together issues,

847
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,760
 and addressing your individual issues.

848
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
 Anything that's gonna hurt your relationship,

849
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,620
 anything that you see together,

850
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,640
 that you go, man, we're gonna sit down,

851
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,480
 we're gonna talk about this,

852
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
 we're gonna work through this together.

853
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,760
 I want us to be on the same page about this object.

854
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,240
 What do I mean by some of the foxes

855
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,640
 that may be in your relationship

856
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,840
 or foxes that may be inside of your life?

857
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,680
 One of them may be your conflict style.

858
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,320
 That hey, we're gonna work quickly to address the fox

859
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,460
 that our conflict, which is not a bad thing,

860
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,000
 we've got tons of messages on conflict,

861
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,840
 if you haven't heard those, but basically conflict

862
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,400
 or having a disagreement between a person,

863
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,620
 between two people, is not necessarily a bad thing.

864
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,580
 It can be something that this conflict

865
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,580
 leads us to form tighter relationship together.

866
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,400
 So we're gonna know how each other,

867
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
 kind of how we fight, and we're gonna fight well

868
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,680
 and fight fair, and we're gonna allow that

869
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
 to move us closer together.

870
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,620
 So some of you may need to work on

871
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,680
 and understand your conflict style

872
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,380
 and their conflict style, so that you don't just

873
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,880
 get into a relationship and rely on,

874
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,960
 hey, we're in a fight and we don't really

875
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,160
 talk to each other and I just kind of

876
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,180
 go silent for six weeks, or we're just gonna

877
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,920
 bank on makeup sex all the time, that's gonna be it.

878
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
 That's not gonna work, but you need

879
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
 to know your conflict style.

880
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,800
 What do I mean by that?

881
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,640
 We have a term and an expression called weenie.

882
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,160
 You need to know your weenie and you need to know

883
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,200
 their weenie.

884
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
 What do I mean by that?

885
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,760
 Rate it off for romance, people.

886
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,340
 Weenie stands for withdrawal, escalation,

887
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,240
 negative interpretation, or invalidation.

888
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,480
 In every conflict style, you typically

889
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,240
 have somebody who's one of those

890
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,980
 and the other person is another one of them,

891
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,040
 or you're just like, you hit the jackpot

892
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,600
 and you're all four of them, and that's gotta be interesting.

893
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,640
 So you need to know, like hey, do I withdraw?

894
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,520
 Like in conflict, am I like, oh, I just shut down

895
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,560
 and I try to disappear and I just cover myself up?

896
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,440
 Are you that person?

897
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,400
 Are you the escalator?

898
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,160
 Where they get into a conflict and you escalate

899
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,200
 and you're like, you know, this is what you always do.

900
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,680
 Are you that person?

901
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,000
 Are you the negative interpreter where the guy's like,

902
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,600
 hey man, this is great, did you,

903
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,680
 is that a new shirt?

904
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,960
 And you're like, oh, you think I have a materialism problem?

905
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,120
 Huh, I'm green, is that what you're trying

906
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,000
 to tell me right now?

907
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,320
 Or you don't like my fashion choice?

908
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,280
 Are you a negative interpreter?

909
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,200
 Or are you an invalidator where the person

910
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
 shares their hurt and you're like, well,

911
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,160
 that's just 'cause you are a big softie

912
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,600
 and you need to toughen up in life.

913
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,920
 You know, it's hard, get back in the game.

914
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,160
 All right, which style are you?

915
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,120
 And you need to know this.

916
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,880
 I'm joking, but this is so huge and so important.

917
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,680
 And you need to know if you're dating someone,

918
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,360
 you need to have a death grip on what they are

919
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,640
 and what you are so that you know, like, man,

920
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,760
 this is just kind of the patterns.

921
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,760
 In my relationship with my wife, I am an escalator,

922
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,280
 she's a withdrawer, which is very entertaining

923
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,800
 'cause we get in conflict and she's like,

924
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
 I'm disappearing, I'm like, you come back here.

925
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,080
 (congregation laughing)

926
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,960
 That's not funny at all, but,

927
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,880
 but, (laughing)

928
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,960
 but in knowing that about one another,

929
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,160
 here's what that looks like for us.

930
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,440
 It's like she withdraws and it's incumbent on her

931
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,520
 to know, hey, I need some time to process

932
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,280
 and I need like a minute and I need some time to think.

933
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,600
 And we have come, and through counsel in our life,

934
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,400
 people have gone, that's fine, but then if you withdraw,

935
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,700
 you need to know that it is incumbent on you

936
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,240
 to restart the conversation.

937
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,400
 So you go, he wants to work through right now

938
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,640
 and you're like, I just need some time.

939
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,240
 Great, you need to go process that yourself

940
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,640
 and then you arrange for, hey,

941
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,040
 I would like to talk about this.

942
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,920
 It is incumbent on you.

943
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,660
 He's trying to work through the conflict.

944
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,360
 Now you, if you need to take time,

945
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,720
 you can't just let it lie and kinda like

946
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,880
 hope it'll disappear.

947
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,760
 You go, you work through that, and then you come back

948
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,040
 and you work through that together.

949
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,440
 Whatever your conflict style is, you need to know that

950
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,200
 because like so few things,

951
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,280
 conflict will kill a relationship.

952
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,720
 It is a fox that will eat your relationship

953
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,000
 and your intimacy.

954
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,640
 It is crushing marriages all over our country,

955
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,480
 all over our world.

956
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,240
 It has crushed and killed marriages

957
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,400
 because they couldn't work through conflict

958
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,920
 and they went from caring about the other person

959
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,420
 and caring about their relationship to just wanting to win

960
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,800
 and just wanting to hurt the other person.

961
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
 So you need to know your conflict style.

962
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,960
 Other than foxes that you should kill, pornography.

963
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,560
 If you're looking at pornography,

964
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,280
 you are feeding something that is creating

965
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,400
 an unrealistic sexual expectation

966
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,120
 that is going to crush your wife.

967
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,980
 You are feeding something that is telling you

968
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,880
 and teaching your mind to think a real woman is not enough

969
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,320
 and one woman is not enough.

970
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,920
 And if you're a girl looking at pornography,

971
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,000
 you are feeding yourself the same thing.

972
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,480
 A real man is not enough and what matters most

973
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,040
 is his ability to sexually please me

974
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,080
 and you're feeding an unrealistic expectation

975
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,640
 and that is a fox that it is gonna show up

976
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,080
 and it's feeding an appetite

977
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,680
 that is one of the leading causes of why people get divorced.

978
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
 Another fox that'll show up in your relationship

979
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,200
 would be bitterness and anger

980
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,040
 that you need to make sure before you get married,

981
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
 before you move into that next relationship,

982
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,600
 that you have forgiven those who have hurt you most in life.

983
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,040
 I will not do a wedding for someone

984
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 if they have not forgiven their parents.

985
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,440
 If they have said, man, I have never forgiven my dad

986
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,120
 who left or cheated on my mom, I will not do your wedding

987
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,600
 and I wouldn't advise anybody to do your wedding.

988
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,960
 If they're harboring bitterness,

989
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,200
 because here's what that means, man, this is so huge.

990
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,880
 They're saying somebody deeply hurt me

991
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,280
 and I'm holding onto that and I'm not letting it go

992
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,880
 and I'm holding it against them.

993
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,940
 What do you think marriage is?

994
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,340
 It is repeated time after time

995
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,440
 of somebody deeply hurting you, your wife or your husband

996
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,780
 and you having to choose, I forgive you.

997
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,760
 I'm choosing to believe the best.

998
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,320
 I'm choosing to move in your direction.

999
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,720
 I'm choosing to let that go

1000
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,260
 and if they're not good at letting it go and forgiving now,

1001
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,620
 they're not getting better

1002
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,740
 and I would not advise you to move forward

1003
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,640
 in that relationship,

1004
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,420
 regardless of if someone will marry you or not.

1005
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,840
 If they have not made the decision,

1006
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,620
 I'm choosing to forgive this person who deeply hurt me

1007
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,360
 and I'm not letting it go.

1008
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:20,360
 Another Fox to address in this season is sexual abuse.

1009
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,400
 Statistically, the numbers are shocking

1010
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,180
 and they're all over this room.

1011
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,640
 If that's a part of your story,

1012
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,360
 it doesn't have to define you.

1013
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,080
 It wasn't your fault.

1014
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,420
 There's hope, there's healing.

1015
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,120
 God loves you and the pain that was inflicted there

1016
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,980
 but there will take some healing

1017
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,140
 and you pursuing that with God's people

1018
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,500
 and you bringing that into the light

1019
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,180
 and processing and talking through that.

1020
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,540
 You're not damaged goods.

1021
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,900
 It won't or it doesn't have to define your marriage

1022
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,740
 or your future sex life and it wasn't your fault

1023
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,080
 and there's hope and there's healing

1024
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,740
 but you've gotta be intentional to accept it

1025
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,620
 or to pursue that because that's a Fox

1026
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,800
 that you didn't even ask for

1027
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,600
 but it's a Fox that can show up

1028
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,300
 and really hurt your relationship

1029
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,740
 and in dating and in your relationship together,

1030
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,260
 regardless of what the Fox is,

1031
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,940
 you guys need to honestly talk about these things

1032
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,140
 and not act like we're sitting there at the dinner table

1033
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,980
 and this is so great

1034
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,740
 and there's Foxes everywhere around you

1035
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,820
 and the same way that you wouldn't do that

1036
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,340
 if there were ravenous wolves all the way around you,

1037
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,940
 you're just eating and hanging out, this is so great

1038
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,640
 and everywhere you look, there's like, you know,

1039
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,440
 these Foxes looking to kill you, that's what's going on.

1040
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,320
 The Bible says that Satan hates you.

1041
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,640
 He hates your relationship.

1042
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,760
 He wants you to be in shame right now.

1043
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,040
 He doesn't want you to get married.

1044
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
 He wants to kill off your relationships

1045
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,680
 before they ever happen.

1046
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,880
 He's not just like a Fox, he's like a roaring lion

1047
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,980
 looking for someone to be devoured.

1048
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,200
 I don't even know that I fully understand what that means.

1049
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,600
 That's 1 Peter chapter five

1050
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,300
 but I feel like I've seen it

1051
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,760
 and I've seen marriages devoured

1052
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,440
 because these little Foxes, they began to grow

1053
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,000
 and they began to grow and they began to multiply

1054
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,660
 and they just devoured that relationship

1055
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,280
 and you have an enemy and you need to listen to me.

1056
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
 He hates you.

1057
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,720
 He wants you to hide in sin.

1058
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,920
 He wants you to hide in shame.

1059
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,800
 He doesn't want you guys to work through your dysfunction.

1060
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,040
 He just wants you to cover it up with sex.

1061
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,320
 Like, oh man, we'll just have crazy manic highs and lows

1062
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,640
 and just cover all that stuff up.

1063
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,360
 He doesn't want you to have healthy relationships.

1064
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,720
 He wants you to get divorced.

1065
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,440
 He wants your kids to grow up without a father

1066
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,400
 or without a mother around.

1067
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
 He wants you to be depressed.

1068
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
 He hates you.

1069
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,940
 He doesn't want you to listen to any of the things

1070
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,340
 that God's word says about love, romance, sex.

1071
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,660
 He wants you to tune it out and go,

1072
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,340
 that's so unrealistic, I'm not doing that.

1073
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,980
 Or for you to begin to buy the lie that,

1074
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,100
 oh man, that must work for like

1075
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,440
 goody two-shoe Christian people

1076
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,580
 but I've got a story and I've got a past.

1077
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,700
 He hates you.

1078
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,540
 That's a lie.

1079
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,400
 And the story that God is gonna write in your life

1080
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,300
 is not over but you are in the driver's seat.

1081
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,820
 If you're gonna surrender that to him,

1082
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,900
 are you gonna allow the Foxes

1083
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,480
 and Satan to destroy your relationships?

1084
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,840
 He hates romance.

1085
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,520
 He hates sex.

1086
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,600
 And he wants to take it out of the context of marriage

1087
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,360
 and inject it into your life.

1088
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,740
 And it may bring like some amazing highs in a moment

1089
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,880
 followed with some incredible pain.

1090
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,200
 And he wants you to wallow in shame.

1091
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,600
 And the God who's there loves you.

1092
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,880
 He's crazy about you.

1093
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,260
 He wants you to have a romance life

1094
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,420
 like you could only dream of.

1095
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,180
 And the whole book of this Song of Solomon

1096
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,380
 is about that love story.

1097
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,220
 And he's for you.

1098
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,660
 And he wants you to experience like the safety

1099
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,660
 and security and intimacy with a spouse in marriage.

1100
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,320
 And if you're dating right now,

1101
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,380
 you need to be on the lookout.

1102
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,940
 Like what are our Foxes?

1103
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,840
 What are the things that are gonna kill our relationship

1104
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,580
 before it continues to grow and blossom all the way there?

1105
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,680
 And then finally in verse 16 it says this.

1106
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,840
 My beloved is mine and I'm his.

1107
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,360
 He browses among the lilies.

1108
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,560
 Scholars debate and disagree and some say

1109
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,880
 that most of this chapter may have been engagement,

1110
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,700
 but without question most will say like

1111
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,680
 this is probably the engagement line.

1112
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
 She's saying like hey, I'm declaring.

1113
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,180
 I'm for you, you're for me.

1114
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,080
 We're in this to win it ride or die together.

1115
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,160
 For the rest of our life, that's what's going on.

1116
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,000
 We're engaged.

1117
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,780
 Further we know that because next week

1118
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,600
 is the wedding and the wedding night.

1119
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,460
 And it is about to go down if you know what I'm saying.

1120
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,580
 And so we at least know entering into that,

1121
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,220
 they are engaged by this line.

1122
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,260
 And they're moving towards tying that knot together.

1123
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,120
 And if you're gonna move towards tying that knot

1124
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,220
 in relationship, you need to make sure

1125
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,700
 that you are dating in a way that it is progressing.

1126
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,660
 At some point you are expressing

1127
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,180
 kind of the intimacy parts of your heart,

1128
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
 the intimate parts of your heart,

1129
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,420
 your story, your past.

1130
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,620
 And that you're addressing and confronting

1131
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,640
 the issues in your life and in your relationship together.

1132
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,800
 I shared earlier about the idea of like a knot holding.

1133
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,620
 And you know, I was thinking about like a knot this week

1134
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,580
 and how do I know if a knot will hold?

1135
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,560
 And I was trying to think of like,

1136
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,860
 are there two types of ropes?

1137
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,100
 Or what are the types of ropes in the world

1138
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,620
 that you take this rope and you take this rope

1139
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,420
 and they really won't hold together?

1140
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,300
 And there really isn't one.

1141
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,180
 Like you may be going, well what about a really thick rope?

1142
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,140
 And what about like a thin rope?

1143
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,740
 I mean you could still tie a knot out of them.

1144
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,620
 There isn't like these two incompatible ropes

1145
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,660
 that are unable to tie together.

1146
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,260
 What matters in the ability for a knot to hold,

1147
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,920
 think about it, is two things.

1148
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,820
 Who's tying the knot and what type of knot they're tying.

1149
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,660
 In other words, like my one and a half year old

1150
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,760
 may not be able to tie a knot that's that tight.

1151
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,020
 She may end up just like leaving it at this

1152
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,660
 because she's not strong enough to tie it.

1153
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,480
 Or she doesn't know how to tie a knot

1154
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,680
 that will actually hold.

1155
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,120
 The Bible says that your relationship,

1156
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,960
 what God hopes for you,

1157
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,760
 and what our hope for this entire series, man,

1158
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,320
 and we are praying that God does incredible things

1159
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,560
 in this room and everywhere,

1160
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,200
 every different PortsLive location,

1161
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,840
 wherever you're listening in from,

1162
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,520
 that God does incredible things in your hearts,

1163
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,080
 relationships, that he sets you up to marry someone

1164
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,140
 who loves Jesus more than he loves you.

1165
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,040
 That he's gonna be someone who chases and pursues

1166
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,880
 after you the rest of your life,

1167
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,180
 that you follow and lead together

1168
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,020
 for the rest of your life,

1169
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,360
 that you raise children who walk with Jesus together

1170
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,800
 and candidly that he breaks up so many relationships

1171
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,720
 in this room that you need to get out of

1172
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,880
 because you are,

1173
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
 candidly, dude, you're not gonna find Mr. Right

1174
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,440
 because you're dating Mr. Right now

1175
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,640
 and you're not gonna experience who God has for you.

1176
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,760
 And you're holding on 'cause you're like,

1177
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,680
 we built relational equity together

1178
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,120
 and I'm just afraid of breaking up

1179
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,360
 and I feel like I've gone too far already

1180
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,600
 and you are gonna miss out on what God has for you.

1181
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,840
 You always do when you go against God's word.

1182
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,800
 What type of knot does God wanna tie

1183
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,040
 as it relates to your relationships?

1184
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,880
 The answer to who's tying the knot,

1185
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,160
 Jesus would say in Matthew chapter 19, is God.

1186
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,680
 He says, "For this reason a man will leave his father

1187
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,080
 "and mother and be united to his wife

1188
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,000
 "and the two become one flesh."

1189
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,120
 And he says, "What God has joined or tied together,

1190
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,920
 "let no person separate."

1191
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,780
 That God is the one that ultimately saying like,

1192
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,240
 I wanna tie a knot that is so strong

1193
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,760
 for the rest of your life, nothing in this world,

1194
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,600
 nothing that you face, no matter what you walk through,

1195
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,560
 nothing will tear it apart.

1196
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,920
 Every struggle that you go through

1197
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,640
 and everything the world pulls on you

1198
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,080
 is only gonna pull you tighter and tighter and tighter

1199
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,520
 and tighter and tighter together.

1200
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,360
 That's the knot that he wants to tie.

1201
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,400
 And it's a knot or the type of knot is a covenant.

1202
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,560
 That it's not some contract relationship

1203
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,280
 that you have with the other person, what's a contract?

1204
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,480
 It's like, hey, I'm in this and we'll be married

1205
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,120
 unless you gain 20 pounds and then I'm out.

1206
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,360
 That's a contract.

1207
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,200
 He is a covenant, what's a covenant?

1208
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,120
 It's an unending, unbreakable, unstoppable relationship

1209
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,500
 and bond, commitment to one another.

1210
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,260
 No matter what happens, I'm not going anywhere.

1211
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,420
 You cannot have that type of covenant relationship.

1212
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,740
 And the experience of the knot he wants to bond in your life

1213
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,300
 without first having a covenant relationship with God.

1214
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,760
 The first love of your life must be Jesus.

1215
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,000
 The first love of their life must be Jesus.

1216
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,360
 That's not some preachy language.

1217
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,320
 I promise you, I've just seen it too many times.

1218
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,680
 Where couples come together and they're sweet

1219
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,320
 and they love hanging out together and this is great

1220
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,480
 and then a few short years go by and they got a kid.

1221
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,800
 And they're standing there signing papers

1222
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,100
 and they hate one another.

1223
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,080
 And it was because they didn't form a covenant,

1224
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,280
 they didn't have the type of knot

1225
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,980
 that God wants to create in your life

1226
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,760
 that is first anchored in a covenant relationship with God.

1227
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,240
 If you are not a follower of Jesus,

1228
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,200
 the best thing you can leave with is not how to date

1229
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,340
 and tips and tricks and all that.

1230
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,120
 It is that there's a God who's invited you

1231
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,680
 into a love story that is far bigger than Song of Solomon,

1232
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,720
 far bigger than the girl that you met from Tinder,

1233
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,160
 far bigger than any relationship

1234
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,000
 that you will ever have in this life.

1235
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,140
 It's his love story of chasing and pursuing you.

1236
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,880
 And he wants to create this covenant in your future marriage.

1237
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,440
 So no matter what, I'm staying.

1238
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,740
 But you won't have that if it's not,

1239
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,920
 or if it is disconnected

1240
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,380
 from the covenant relationship with God.

1241
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,840
 From the God who said,

1242
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,800
 no matter what you do, I'm staying.

1243
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,080
 I died in your place, I gave my life for you.

1244
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,320
 How do you know that God can keep a knot that lasts

1245
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,600
 or tie a knot that no matter what you face in this life,

1246
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,640
 it will last, no matter what you walk through, it can hold.

1247
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,860
 He's already done it once.

1248
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,920
 He has promised that nothing in all of creation,

1249
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,120
 Romans chapter eight says,

1250
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,280
 neither height nor depth nor anything else

1251
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,920
 in all of creation could separate you from the love of God.

1252
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,360
 That is the covenant that he's already created.

1253
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,780
 You may not know this, if you're not a believer,

1254
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,460
 Christians don't believe like,

1255
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,920
 good people go to heaven and we just come in here

1256
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,780
 and we're like, I'm a really good person,

1257
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,620
 that's why I'm here.

1258
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,460
 And we sing songs like,

1259
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,340
 ♪ David, David, you're such a really good guy ♪

1260
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,160
 We say, Jesus, Jesus, you're our savior, you're our Lord.

1261
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,080
 It's only because of you that I have a relationship

1262
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,740
 with God, you pursued me, you came after me,

1263
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,700
 you loved me despite me and you died in my place.

1264
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,840
 And you paid for everything I've ever done.

1265
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,940
 And if I will accept and receive that gift,

1266
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:23,520
 I enter into the covenant, the unbreakable love of God,

1267
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,280
 where he says, nothing you ever do you may run,

1268
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,760
 you can't hide from my love.

1269
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,200
 And you can't escape it and you can't break it.

1270
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,260
 And it's just that, that relationship, you know,

1271
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,800
 that your heart kinda longs for in marriage,

1272
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,000
 you don't even realize it's longing for me.

1273
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,720
 It's longing for the love of God

1274
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,440
 and this unending, unstoppable, perfect love.

1275
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,840
 It's only in knowing and experiencing that love

1276
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,920
 that you'll have any type of romance

1277
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,120
 that you're looking for.

1278
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,180
 And tonight, the choice for many of you is to say,

1279
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,440
 man, am I gonna believe that?

1280
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,660
 And am I gonna receive that?

1281
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,320
 For others of you, you need to evaluate honestly,

1282
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,420
 am I progressing?

1283
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,840
 Am I afraid to just express some stuff in my life and heart?

1284
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,360
 And are we addressing, like, are we a good couple?

1285
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,920
 Are we able to actually work through our issues

1286
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,900
 and move forward?

1287
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,080
 Because we have a God who paid for all of our issues.

1288
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,160
 They don't define us.

1289
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,260
 They don't have to define our relationship.

1290
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:30,320
 But the choice is yours.

1291
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,640
 Let me pray.

1292
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,160
 Father, thank you that you have given us a way

1293
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,680
 that we can have eternal life and abundant life today.

1294
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,400
 (congregation murmuring)

1295
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,920
 God, the greatest romance and love we've ever craved

1296
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,440
 is found in you.

1297
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,520
 And we just declare that we need your help to believe that,

1298
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,040
 to walk in that, to accept that,

1299
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,160
 that the love I've been looking for

1300
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,040
 since the day I was born is you.

1301
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,040
 And no marriage and no relationship and no children

1302
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,760
 and no anything else that I would search to satisfy

1303
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,120
 that could actually satisfy it.

1304
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,840
 And so would you help us, God, to believe that?

1305
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,400
 I pray for friends in the room who are walking through

1306
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,640
 breakup.

1307
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,600
 God, for friends that need to break up,

1308
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,000
 you give them peace and clarity and conviction.

1309
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,580
 Friends that need to move into that next season of marriage

1310
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,320
 that God, you would bless and your hand of favor

1311
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,560
 would be on relationships inside of this room

1312
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,800
 and they would get married.

1313
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,880
 They would raise children who know the King,

1314
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,880
 the creator of the world, the savior of all humanity

1315
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,160
 and the lover of their souls.

1316
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:54,440
 Father, we worship you now in song, amen.

1317
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:04,440
