00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [Heartbeat]

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Exhale]

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Love it.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We are continuing the series, Exhale.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 If it's your first time, you came on a great night,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 and we would highly encourage you to go back and check out all the exhale messages

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 as we just explore this topic of finding relief or finding an exhale in a world

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 that seems to be anything but relaxing or providing anything but relief.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And so we're walking through the Psalms where we're just experiencing what God has provided for us.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 So hello, friends of the room. Hello, friends of Fort Worth, friends of Houston.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'm going to start by reading Psalm 118. If you have a Bible, you can flip over to Psalm 118.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We're going to explore that together, and I'm going to read it, and then we will walk through it.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It says this, Psalm 118, starting in verse 1.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 "Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. His love endures forever.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Let Israel say, 'His love endures forever.'

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Let the house of Aaron say, 'His love endures forever.'

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Let those who fear the Lord say, 'His love endures forever.'

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 When hard-pressed, I cried to the Lord. He brought me into a spacious place.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 The Lord is with me. I will not be afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 The Lord is with me. He is my helper. I will look in triumph on my enemies.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humans.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 All nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord, I cut them down.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 They surrounded me on every side, but in the name of the Lord, I cut them down.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 They swarmed around me like bees, but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 In the name of the Lord, I cut them down. I was pushed back, about to fall.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 But the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and my defense.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 He has become my salvation. Shouts of joy and victory resound in the tents of the righteous.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 The Lord's right hand has done mighty things. The Lord's right hand is lifted high.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 The Lord's right hand has done mighty things. I will not die, but live,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 and will proclaim what the Lord has done. The Lord chastened me severely,

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 but he has not given me over to death. Open for me the gates of the righteous.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I will enter and give thanks to the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I will give thanks for you answered me, and you've become my salvation.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 The Lord has done it this very day. Let us rejoice today and be glad.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Lord, save us. Lord, grant us success. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 From the house of the Lord, we bless you.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 The Lord is God, and he has made his light shine on us. With bows in hand,

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 join in the festal procession up to the horns of the altar.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You are my God, and I will praise you. You are my God, and I will exalt you.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Let me pray, and we will dive in.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Father, we thank you just for this psalm.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And I pray for the next 30 minutes that we'll have together.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I pray that you would allow us to see more of the King that we just sang to.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 The King that we worship through song.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Many of us have a relationship with the King whose name is Jesus.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Whose name we will praise for all eternity if we know him.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And so would you help us to see him, because you tell us in seeing him we're changed.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Thank you for just today. Thank you for the cold weather.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Thank you for Thanksgiving week. Thank you for a million other things that I take for granted.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And we have much to be thankful for.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And at the top of that list is Jesus. Help us now to see him. We love you. Amen.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Have you ever been, I'll start tonight like this, stood up for something?

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And it's a terrible feeling, isn't it?

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I remember my earliest memory of being stood up was when I was like five or six years old.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And it was involving something called Indian guides.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 You guys remember Indian guides or Indian princes? Yes.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 You know Indian guides are still around.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It's like on a very short list of politically incorrect things that we still are hanging on to.

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Along with Aunt Jemima.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And so I was an Indian guide, which if you don't know what Indian guides are,

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 it's like a Boy Scout, but you're essentially you go camping father-son.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 You go stay in teepees and you camp out and do these camp outs.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And I was an Indian guide.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And I was like five years old and we had this camp out that was going to take place.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And I was so excited for it. I was pumped.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 It was going to happen. Going to go out camp with all the different people in our tribe.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 You go out and you stay in this big teepee all together.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And you and your father go out there.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And I went out with a friend because my dad was going to come meet us out there that night.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And so we go out, we set up camp. This is great.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 You know, we're playing with s'mores, getting to see fire.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And as a five-year-old, this is amazing.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And I'm beginning to realize, oh man, it's getting late.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 It's getting close to dinner. We have the s'mores, we do dinner.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And oh no, it's getting later and later.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Dad still hasn't shown up. Where is he?

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I'm sure he's going to come. I'm sure he's coming through.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Where is he going to come? Or when is he going to come?

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And I continue to wait. And all of a sudden, it's like, oh no, it's getting later and later.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 It's like nightfall. It's time to go to bed.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And dad still hasn't shown up. Oh man, he's going to show up.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And he continues. Or I continue to wait and wait.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And he still hadn't come. And now everyone's going to sleep.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, where is my dad?

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I'm sitting outside of the teepee because I can't sleep.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Because I'm in there with a bunch of my friends and their dads who are just scary old men to me.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And so I'm waiting outside going where, when is he going to come?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 This is like pre-cell phone, so there's no like, hey, I got you.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 It was like, oh man, where is he?

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 If anything, he may have had a pager, but it didn't allow immediate communication.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And I continued to wait and waited, honestly, until like two in the morning.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And I see this car that pulled up because he had just gotten back from a business trip.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 But it's one of those moments where I was like, man, is he going to show up?

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Where is he? He's letting me down.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I don't know if he's going to come through. Will he come through?

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 He certainly didn't come through like I had planned for him to.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And the reason I start there is because I think a lot of us, as it relates to our relationship with God,

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 wondering like, where is he? Is he going to show up?

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Is he going to come through? Is he going to appear?

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Like I find myself, I feel like I'm waiting.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I feel like God isn't right now fighting for me.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I wish that my circumstances in my life were different.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I don't feel like God's going to come through and provide a job.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 My singleness doesn't seem to be going away.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And this might, my biological clock is ticking.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 I don't know if God is going to come through. Where is he?

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And so tonight we're going to look at a psalm.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And we just read a psalm that really answers that question as we just explore a really common experience for all of us,

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 including believers of wondering this question.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 God, are you going to come through? Where are you?

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Will you come through? Can I trust and can you be trusted?

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Can I trust that you're going to show up?

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And David gives us the answer to that inside of the Psalm 118.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And so Psalm 118, there's a little bit of background as we just explore why we can be confident God comes through for his people.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Psalm 118 has a very particular background that I'll kind of dive into and give us an explanation and do it as clearly as I can.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Hopefully, Psalm 118 was very unique among all the psalms.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So the psalms we're doing this series, exhale,

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 we're looking at these songs that were part of the Psalms, which is just a songbook.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So the Israel, Nation of Israel, had on the Israeli iPod was the psalm book, if you will.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 All the different psalms are just songs that they would sing.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Psalm 118 was very unique among all of them.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Arguably, it was one of the most sung of all of the psalms.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It was a psalm that was sung to remind the nation God will show up and fight for his people.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And it was sung every year at a very particular event.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That event was a holiday known as Passover.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 In other words, on Passover, which is like this holiday, they'd come every single year, they'd get together and at Passover, they'd have this meal.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Similar to Thanksgiving, honestly.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Thanksgiving, we think food and football, right?

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And at Passover, you thought food and football.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 We didn't think football.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 At Passover, you got together and you thought food and you thought about this event.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 As you looked back, and it was a celebration, much like Thanksgiving where we celebrate the pilgrims and the Indians getting together.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Much like there, at Passover, you'd come together and you'd eat this meal.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And it would be done in remembrance of a moment in time where God showed up for the people and the Nation of Israel.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 He fought for his people and did so by passing over them.

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Passover. What does it mean to pass over?

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 What took place that led to the annual celebration of Passover?

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Passover goes back to the founding of the Nation of Israel.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So I promise this is going somewhere.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Because this is the context in which they would sing this song every single year.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Passover was a celebration of what God did when the Nation was founded.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 The Nation was slaves, originally, in Egypt.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So Pharaoh, slaves. Remember this story?

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Moses is raised up. The Nation is there.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And God says, "Moses, go get my people, the Nation of Israel, out of slavery."

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 There are slaves down there. They're doing all the work for the Egyptians.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Moses goes to Pharaoh and says, "Hey, God wants his people back. We'd like to leave."

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Pharaoh says, "No."

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And so God says, "I'm going to send different plagues."

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Moses goes again and says, "Let my people go."

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Pharaoh says, "No."

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He sends another plague.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And Pharaoh is just like, "Come on. We can take it. Frogs? I like the frogs. You want some more?"

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 God continues to send these ten plagues.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And eventually, he sends one that loosens Pharaoh's grip.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 And it was the plague known as the Death of the Firstborn.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And in the Death of the Firstborn, Moses goes to Pharaoh and says,

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 "God is going to kill every firstborn in the land,

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 unless they have the blood of a spotless lamb over the doorframe of their home.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And if that blood is there, of this spotless lamb, the angel of the Lord will pass over.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But I'm going to do this, Pharaoh," God says, "so that you will let my people go."

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Pharaoh says, "Bring it."

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 The angel of the Lord shows up. He passes over every home.

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Or he does not kill the firstborn in every single home that had the blood of the lamb over it.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Pharaoh's home did not have that.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 His child dies, and he finally opens his hand and says, "Get out of here."

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And so the nation of Israel celebrated because that allowed them to go become a nation.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That moment took place with the Passover feast.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And at the Passover, they would sing Psalm 118.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And remember, our God is a God who shows up and comes through.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And in Psalm 118, we realize why they were so confident.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 God's going to show up and fight for his people.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 So we're going to pick it up in verse 1, and we'll walk through this story of this song

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 that they would sing every single year together over the Passover feast.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 When you thought about Passover, much like Christmas, it's like, "Oh, holy night."

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You think Christmas songs.

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 The NSYNC Christmas playlist on the Passover playlist was Psalm 118.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I love it. It's such a great album.

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Okay, verse 1. Here we go.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 "Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever."

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 "Let Israel say, 'His love endures forever.'"

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So let the nation say, "Let the house of Aaron's"--that's the priests.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 "Let them say, 'His love endures forever.'"

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 "Let those who fear the Lord say"--that's the non-Jews.

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 If you were not a Jew but you believed in God, you were called a God-fearer.

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 "So let those who fear the Lord"--the non-Jews--say, "His love endures forever."

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 So it really starts high-energy, up-top song.

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's like a pep rally where the singer is basically going,

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 "Hey, where are my Jews in the house? Praise the Lord!"

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 "Where are all my priests? We got no priests in this place? Praise the Lord!"

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 "Where are my Gentiles at? You're not a Jew. Praise the Lord. Let me hear from you."

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And it starts off really high-energy, up-top, where he's going, "Hey, everybody get involved."

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 And then all of a sudden it goes from everyone to just one person stepping up to the microphone,

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 and he begins to say why they can praise and define the Lord.

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But he gives us, inside of this, this defining characteristic of who God is

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and why he can be trusted to come through.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Inside of that. In other words, David starts off this psalm and he says,

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 "Let me tell you why you can trust God."

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 He's a God who's marked by one quality.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 One defining characteristic pops out, and it's a characteristic that his love endures forever.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 "His love never ends," your American translation would say.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 "His love never ends."

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 The first idea, or the first point that comes from this song is that God never stops loving you.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 God never stops loving you.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 If you're a part of God's people, God's covenant people,

210
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 the first idea introduced in this song is that God never stops loving you.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And he uses a specific word. His love endures forever, and he uses the word "hesed."

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 What does the word "hesed" mean?

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 "Hesed" is a word that appears over and over in the Old Testament.

214
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Covenant-keeping love.

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 What is "hesed"? What's the word? His love.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 What kind of love endures forever? My covenant-keeping love.

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 In other words, David says his love towards his people that he has stepped into a covenant with.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 When God looks at you, his love never ends.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 If you are in covenant relationship with him, it never ceases.

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 There's nothing you can do to stop it, nothing you can do to change it.

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And David says, "Let's start by praising the Lord, everybody in the different spheres,

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 because God's a God whose love will never cease, will never stop, because we're in a covenant with him."

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 What's a covenant? A covenant is very different from a contract.

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 God says, "I have this very particular love for my people,"

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 which would be then the nation of Israel.

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 If you're a part of the church, you've put faith in Jesus, you are a part of the people of God.

227
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And God says, "You're in a covenant with me, and that covenant means I'll never stop loving you."

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 If you're a part of his people, I'll never stop loving you, because this isn't a contract.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 A contract is you do certain things, and if you do them, or you don't do certain things,

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 I don't want you to, then I'll love you.

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 But if you stop doing those things, or you start doing the things I don't want you to, then I'm out of here.

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 That's a contract. God says a covenant.

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 A covenant says no matter what you do, I will not stop loving you.

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I will never stop. You can run, you can hide, but I will not stop loving you.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 It's not dissimilar, or really marriage is the clearest example that we have of this.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 It's an imperfect one because of so many marriages that just imperfectly reflected,

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 but marriage is a covenant.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I remember when I married my wife, and JP did the ceremony,

239
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 and we stood up there, and I looked eyeball to eyeball with my wife, Callie,

240
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 wearing this white dress, and we made these insane promises.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We took these vows, and we promised that I will never stop loving you,

242
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 for better or for worse. I'm not going anywhere.

243
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 If you go crazy, and you run off to Venezuela, I'm coming after you.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 I will never stop loving you.

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 That's the promises that you make inside of that covenant.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And she looked at me. It means there were no ifs inside of that.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You never go, "And I vow that as long if, or if you don't do this, then I will."

248
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Inside of that, it's not conditional. That's what a covenant is.

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I'll never stop loving you.

250
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And God looks at his people, which is the church, and here the nation of Israel,

251
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 and says, "I'll never stop loving you."

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And David says, "Praise the Lord. Here's how we know we can come through,

253
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 because no matter what, I can go to sleep at night knowing God loves me

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 because I'm a part of his covenant."

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 He's a covenant-keeping God whose love endures forever.

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 He never stops loving you. Never stops loving you.

257
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 David starts by saying, "Let's thank the Lord. He's good. He's rich in love.

258
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 That's not the only reason. We know he will come through."

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Here's what he says, verse 5.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 "When I was hard-pressed, I cried to the Lord, and he brought me into a spacious place."

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 David says, "I was in an overwhelmingly tight place."

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 You ever felt like you're overwhelmed, anxious, feel like your chest is getting tight?

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 "I'm in this tight place right now in life. I don't know what I'm going to do about my job,

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 my finances. I was in this tight place, and what did I do?

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I didn't turn to anxiety medication. I didn't turn to substances. I didn't turn to anger.

266
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I turned to you, Lord, and you brought relief," is what David says.

267
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 In other words, in my initial response, which is so foreign for me,

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 when I get overwhelmed or stressed, I feel like I just get angry.

269
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And maybe you can relate to that.

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Or maybe you get like just, you just start wailing because you're overwhelmed.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Maybe you get emotional. Maybe you start turning to alcohol.

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I don't know what it is for you, but all of us will turn in our anxiety to something.

273
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And David says, "Here's what I do. I turn immediately to you, God.

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I bring my anxieties to you immediately. I'm overwhelmed, and I go immediately to you.

275
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I'm in this tight place, and I don't turn to any of these other places.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I turn to you, and I go, 'God, will you help me?

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I'm going to bring the things I'm anxious about to you.'"

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 How much of your life would change?

279
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 How much more would you be able to exhale if you really did that?

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And I don't know why that's so hard for us when we get anxious,

281
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 and I'm like, "Man, I'm just really worried about this."

282
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And someone will be like, "Well, have you prayed about it?"

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "No, I haven't prayed about it. I really enjoy being anxious about this right now."

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Like that, it doesn't make sense at all.

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 We wouldn't even say that, but it's like, "Of course, I should pray about it,

286
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 but for some reason, that's not my knee-jerk response."

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And David says, "Immediately, I'm overwhelmed, and I go to you."

288
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And unlike those things, like alcohol or anger or anything that brings temporary relief,

289
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 which is why we go to Him,

290
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 He says, "I go to you, and you bring lasting, enduring relief

291
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 without other consequences for those other things.

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I turn to you in my anxiety."

293
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He says, verse 6, "The Lord is with me. I will not be afraid.

294
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 What can mere mortals do to me?

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 The Lord is with me. He is my helper.

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 I will look in triumph on my enemies.

297
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 It is better to take refuge," I love this,

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in humans."

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 "It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in princes."

300
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 David describes why he's confident that he can face the world around him,

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 and it's not because his confidence is in himself or in his friends

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 or in some other person or in his job.

303
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 He says, "My confidence and security is in you.

304
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I'm going to take refuge in you. You are the shelter.

305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 You're the reason that I can face the world around me

306
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 that feels like it's falling apart because I find security and strength in you."

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Our second point tonight introduced in this text

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 is that God's protection never fails.

309
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 God's love for you never stops.

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 His protection never fails.

311
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 To those who go and seek his protection

312
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 or who will accept his protection, it never fails.

313
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And David identifies why he can face so confidently the world.

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 His source of protection are found in you alone, God.

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And it's so--I feel like this is so relevant

316
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 because it's so easy to do the opposite of what David says,

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 where he says, "Hey, look, don't find security in other people,

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 in yourself, in money, in the way that you look, in any of those things."

319
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Like, all of us are going to be tempted to find security

320
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 in the things that David just listed out, particularly two of them,

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 as it relates to a person.

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 "Don't find security in a person," David says,

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 "or in princes," he says,

324
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 "or in getting married." Like, I don't find my security

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 or who I am in dating someone.

326
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I'm not the person who always has to be dating someone

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 because there's not a me without a her.

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And so I always have to have someone inside of my life,

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 some sort of relationship that's going on.

330
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I'm not going to be defined by whether or not I'm married.

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I'm not--I don't find my security in those things.

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 How relevant is that?

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I mean, some of you may need to memorize verse 9.

334
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 "It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in prince,"

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 insert "charming" at the end of it,

336
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 that I'm not going to find my security

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 in a man showing up or in a woman,

338
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 princess, charming, showing up.

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I'm not going to be defined by whether or not I'm married,

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 by any of those things.

341
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 "Leave alone, Lord," or where I'm going to find my security.

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I'm going to find my strength.

343
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I'm not going to date to feel loved

344
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 because I'm secure in that I'm loved.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 That's not the reason I'm going to date.

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I may date out of the overflow of my relationship with God,

347
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and I want to make sure that I'm rooted and grounded,

348
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 but I'm not going to date or need to have a boyfriend or girlfriend

349
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 just because I don't feel loved,

350
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 and that's the only way I can experience it.

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 No, David says that's crazy.

352
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 All of those things, if you find security in a person,

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 it's going to fail you, but there's one who won't.

354
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Or find our security in money.

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 How easy it is, David, or we experiencedly--

356
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I know, personally, to find my security in money.

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 There's something about where I'm like,

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 "Man, if I just have a little bit more in the bank, I just feel.

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 The more I have, the more I feel a little bit like,

360
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 'Whew, I can sleep a little bit better at night.'"

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And David would say, "That's crazy.

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 There's only one who can give you true security."

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Ironically, money, despite how it makes us feel more secure,

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 is the thing that we print on it,

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 "Hey, don't find security in this,"

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 or "We don't find security in this."

367
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 You ever think about that?

368
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Like, think about it.

369
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 On the money, we literally print, "In God we trust."

370
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 We don't trust in these little green pieces of paper.

371
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 It's almost like a comical joke, like,

372
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "In God we trust. Oh, my God.

373
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And by God, we mean these things."

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And it's like hilarious.

375
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 We find security in this.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's all of those who fall away in an instant.

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 There's nothing holding up an economy that's based on opinion.

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 All of those can fall away.

379
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 But God is the only thing that provides lasting security.

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Trust in Him.

381
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Confidence or security being found in your looks.

382
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 David would say, "Don't do it."

383
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 The way that you appear, your appearance, your external beauty,

384
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 all of those things are going to fall away.

385
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 If that is the thing where you find security,

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 it's going to fail you and let you down.

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 We see this.

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Thousands of moms within a very short distance of here

389
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 have found their security in the way they look

390
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and they're injecting all kinds of weird things into their body

391
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 to hold on to the beauty that they had in their past.

392
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And it's falling away.

393
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 And David says, "Don't hold on or don't be defined.

394
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Find your security in the way that you look.

395
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Find it alone in God.

396
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 He's the only thing that will last when the storms come.

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 He's the only thing that will last throughout time."

398
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Finding security in a job or in health.

399
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 David says, "I'm going to take refuge in the Lord

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 because all of those things can crumble.

401
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 I'm not going to find my confidence in them."

402
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 It's not dissimilar to...

403
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Have you ever heard of a storm room?

404
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Have you guys heard of...

405
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Friends from Oklahoma, a storm room or like a storm shelter

406
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 or storm dorms, if you will.

407
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Storm dorm is actually a company in town.

408
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 There's a guy who goes to Watermark, remember here,

409
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 and he sells these things called storm dorms.

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And they're these like metal boxes.

411
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 That's what they look like right there.

412
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And inside of a storm dorm,

413
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 it's basically like a box they'll put inside of your house.

414
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They'll put it in your garage.

415
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 They'll build a home around it sometimes.

416
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Very common in Oklahoma.

417
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Any Oklahoma people in this room?

418
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Three of you.

419
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Oh, man, awesome.

420
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Man, and any...

421
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Never mind.

422
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Okay, we'll keep going.

423
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Inside of Oklahoma,

424
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 they find different houses with this inside of it.

425
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And so in that, if a storm comes,

426
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I go inside of that room.

427
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And here's why.

428
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Because this is what happens when a storm comes

429
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 and the houses around you fall apart.

430
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 But those will last in the midst of the storm.

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 They stay standing.

432
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 It's a steel box around you

433
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 that can withstand like thousands and thousands

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 of pounds of things on top of it.

435
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And they provide, not only do they stay standing,

436
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 but anyone inside of them, like think about this.

437
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I just want you to see this.

438
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Anyone inside of that, anyone that goes inside,

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 family came out of that.

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And that family was protected.

441
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 The four-year-old came out of that.

442
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And the four-year-old, if he had been four feet away

443
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 to the left, would not be alive, found protection.

444
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And the only thing that stays standing,

445
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 David says, if you find security

446
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 or you go to anything else to be your protection,

447
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 it's going to crumble, but there is one.

448
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And everyone who goes and seeks refuge inside of him,

449
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Jesus, God, will find protection

450
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 no matter what storms in life come.

451
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But he alone, like he liked that storm dorm

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 in the midst of a storm, stays standing

453
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 and everything inside of it is protected.

454
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 God is that same way.

455
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 When all else around us in this world can crumble,

456
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 he won't.

457
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And David says, go to him, run to him.

458
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 In this room, I know very personally,

459
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 in conversations, there are storms

460
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 that many of you are walking through.

461
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And David would say, and the Bible teaches,

462
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 will you come to God?

463
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Will you come and find your security, rest,

464
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 protection in him?

465
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 His protection never fails.

466
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 The world around you may, your health may,

467
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 but he won't.

468
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And if that is where you find security, you win

469
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 in this life and the next.

470
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And he continues and gives us further illustration

471
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 of how God delivers his people

472
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 in the song that they would sing,

473
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 looking back how God delivered them in Egypt,

474
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 delivered them in Israel at Passover.

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Here's what he says.

476
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 This specifically refers to when they were delivered

477
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 in Egypt.

478
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It comes directly from Exodus.

479
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Here we go, verse 10.

480
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 All nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord,

481
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 I cut them off.

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 They surrounded me on every side,

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 but in the name of the Lord, I cut them off.

484
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 They swarmed around me like bees,

485
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 but they were consumed as quickly as burning thorns.

486
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 In the name of the Lord, I cut them off.

487
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I was pushed back and about to fall,

488
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 but the Lord helped me.

489
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 The Lord is my strength directly from Exodus.

490
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 This is directly from the song they sang

491
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 after they crossed over the Red Sea.

492
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I'll explain that in just a second.

493
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 The Lord is my strength and my defense.

494
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 He's become my salvation.

495
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Shouts of joy and victory resound

496
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 in the tents of the righteous.

497
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 The Lord's right hand has done mighty things.

498
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 The Lord's right hand is lifted high.

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 The Lord's right hand has done mighty things.

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 David refers back and knows his protection never fails

501
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 and they look back as they celebrate

502
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 the events that took place

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 where he delivered them from Egypt.

504
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 How did he deliver them?

505
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 This was when Pharaoh said,

506
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 "Finally, you guys get out of here."

507
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Then Pharaoh went back to his life

508
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and realized it's noon, it's time for lunch.

509
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 There's no one here to make me lunch.

510
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Let's go get these slaves again, guys.

511
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 They go after the slaves

512
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 and the slaves have left the nation of Egypt

513
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 and they're going to found their nation.

514
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 All of a sudden, Pharaoh's army shows up

515
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and they surround them.

516
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 The bad news for the nation of Israel

517
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 is their back was to a sea.

518
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 They have this entire army surrounding them

519
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and then their back is to this ocean.

520
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 They're wondering, "What are we going to do?"

521
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 All of a sudden, God says to Moses,

522
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and you probably know the storyline,

523
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 "Stretch out your hand."

524
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 He reaches out his hand with his staff

525
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 and God parts the sea

526
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 and the nation walks across dry land.

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 It says it's like walls of water were created

528
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and they walked across.

529
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 When they got to the other side,

530
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Pharaoh's army came after

531
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 and the walls crashed down on them.

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 This is the song that they sing.

533
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 The very first song the nation of Israel ever has

534
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 is this one right here,

535
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 that the hand of the Lord has done mighty things.

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 The hand of the Lord has done mighty things,

537
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 that God is in control.

538
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 God is in control.

539
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 He will deliver and He will come through.

540
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He says this in verse 17,

541
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 "I will not die, but live

542
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 "and will proclaim what the Lord has done,

543
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 "that I'm going to live and I can trust

544
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 "because God's in control.

545
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 "God's protection never fails

546
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 "and I will not die before God has appointed the time."

547
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 That as one of our pastors on staff says often,

548
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 "You are immortal until God is done with you."

549
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Another guy who had a open heart surgery

550
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 in response to,

551
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 he basically was going into open heart surgery,

552
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 which is a really dangerous thing,

553
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 and was having a either triple or quadruple bypass

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 and somebody asked him,

555
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 "Hey, are you nervous about it?"

556
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 'Cause like you're on the table.

557
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I mean, open heart surgery is like,

558
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 "Hey, one bad snip, you're done."

559
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 And, "Are you nervous about the surgery?"

560
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And he says, "No."

561
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And they asked, "Why?"

562
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And he said, "Because I'm not gonna live one day less

563
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 "than God has already ordained for me."

564
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And so if so, if I'm on the table and that happens,

565
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 God knows it, He's in control.

566
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I'm not nervous because God is in control

567
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and He's the one who moves the ships.

568
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 He's the one who knows what's going to happen.

569
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 His protection never fails.

570
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He's ordained and I'm immortal until He's done with me.

571
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 He then says this, verse 18,

572
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 "The Lord has chastened me severely,

573
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "but He's not given me over to death."

574
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 That David, wait a second, the Lord disciplined you?

575
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Yes, He disciplines, even His discipline

576
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 is a form of protection.

577
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 You get that, you see what I'm saying in that?

578
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Like even God, David says,

579
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "Look, the Lord even disciplines me,

580
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 "but even in that discipline, it's God protecting me."

581
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It's God, sometimes God will allow inside of your life

582
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 consequences, you to experience consequences for sin,

583
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 me to experience consequences for sin,

584
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 not because He's angry and He's trying to get payback at you,

585
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 it's because He's trying to get you back.

586
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 You know what I mean by that?

587
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 It's not because He's trying to get payback,

588
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 He's trying to bring you back to relationships.

589
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 So He's going to say, "I'm gonna let you get a DWI.

590
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 "I'm gonna let you get an STD.

591
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 "I'm gonna let you lose that job,

592
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 "not 'cause I'm angry, because I love you."

593
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 So even my discipline is protecting you

594
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 because if I don't do that,

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 then you may just continue down that path

596
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 and experience more and more pain.

597
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Even my protection is an expression of my love

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 or even my discipline is an expression of love

599
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and protection for you.

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 It's not dissimilar to, I have a dog

601
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 that is a Rhodesian Ridgeback and he's like 130 pounds.

602
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 He's like a little baby elephant running around.

603
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And we have a shot caller on him,

604
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 which I know I'm getting judged right now

605
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 by all my PETA friends in this room.

606
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 And we'll use the shot caller

607
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 because he will run out and take off into the street.

608
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And so right when he gets over to the edge of the street,

609
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 all of a sudden the electrocution begins

610
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 and he starts taking off back into his owner.

611
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 The reason I do that, it's not that bad.

612
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I've done it to myself plenty of times.

613
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Okay, easy guys.

614
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 It's a static shock.

615
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 The reason we do that is not because we're angry at him

616
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 because we love and we want to protect him

617
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 from running off to where it could hurt God in the same way.

618
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Allows us to experience consequences

619
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 and disciplines his children, not to pay them back,

620
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 but to bring them back to him.

621
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And David says, look, you disciplined me

622
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 not to hurt me or kill me,

623
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 but because of your love and protection for me.

624
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And after establishing that,

625
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 how we know he's going to come through,

626
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 that God always protects, his protection never fails.

627
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 His love never ends.

628
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 He really begins to proclaim

629
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 how we know now we have victory in God.

630
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 And the song turns into like Queens,

631
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 we are the champions from here.

632
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Here's what happens.

633
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It does.

634
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Verse 19, open the gates of the righteous

635
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 and I will enter in and give thanks to the Lord.

636
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 This is the gate through which the Lord,

637
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 the gate of the Lord through which the righteous may enter.

638
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I will give thanks to you for you've answered me.

639
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 You've become my salvation.

640
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 David continues speaking about this like parade

641
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 and this triumphal entry of open up the doors for me.

642
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 The victory is already mine.

643
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 The third idea of the Psalm proclaims

644
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 is that victory is already ours in God

645
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 because God is on our side.

646
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Who can be against us?

647
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Because God is for us, that victory is already ours,

648
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 that God's victory is certain.

649
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 The third idea introduced that no matter what happens,

650
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 we win.

651
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 That no matter what we face in this life,

652
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 if you're in Christ, you win.

653
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 And David says the victory is already ours.

654
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 You can be confident and certain.

655
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 He's basically saying, give me the crown of victory.

656
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Open up the gates, start up the parade

657
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 because I know that my God wins

658
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 and me with him, I win, David says.

659
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And he takes a transition that indicates really

660
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 that there's something else going on in this Psalm.

661
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Here's what he says, verse 22.

662
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 The stone the builders rejected

663
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 has become the cornerstone.

664
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Come, the Lord has done this

665
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 and it is marvelous in our eyes.

666
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 The Lord has done it this very day.

667
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Let us rejoice and be glad.

668
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Lord, save us.

669
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Lord, grant us success.

670
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord

671
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 from the house of the Lord.

672
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 We bless you.

673
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And then David begins to lay out something else

674
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 that's going on in this Psalm.

675
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 The stone the builders rejected.

676
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 We're gonna come back to that in a second.

677
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 But he also points out this idea of Hosanna

678
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 or the Lord has brought success.

679
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 The Lord brings success.

680
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 The word and the reason I say Hosanna is verse 25

681
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 is that word.

682
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Those three words, Lord, give us success

683
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 or Lord, save us, is the word Hosanna.

684
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Hosanna.

685
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 If you grew up in church, you may have heard the word before.

686
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 You may have heard this whole sentence before.

687
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Hosanna, Hosanna.

688
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

689
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 The very words that Jesus,

690
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 as he walked into Jerusalem

691
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 on what was called Palm Sunday.

692
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 If you ever heard of Palm Sunday.

693
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 If you went to church growing up as a kid,

694
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 you'd hold these palm branches around.

695
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 On Palm Sunday, Jesus walks into the city of Jerusalem

696
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 and the men and women gather around him

697
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 and they throw those palm branches on the ground

698
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 and they shout Hosanna, Hosanna.

699
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

700
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And David says and refers to this parade, this triumph.

701
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 We're a part of the victory parade.

702
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 We get to be a part of it.

703
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 David may know or may not know fully

704
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 that he's talking about an event

705
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 that would take place with Christ.

706
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 But he says, let the parade begin.

707
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Hosanna, Hosanna.

708
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Words that would later be repeated

709
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 referring to Jesus as they walk in.

710
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Verse 27, the Lord is God

711
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 and he's made his light shine on us

712
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 with boughs or tree branches in hand.

713
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Join in the festival procession

714
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 up to the horns of the altar.

715
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 So in other words, gather around, bring out palm branches.

716
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 Palm branches would be,

717
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 they were symbolic of the nation of Israel.

718
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 It's just like patriotism, right?

719
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 It'd be like the state of Florida being like,

720
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 we all got oranges.

721
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 If you go over to the nation of Israel,

722
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 they have palm branches everywhere.

723
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 So palm branches represented the nation of Israel.

724
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 This is kind of our flag.

725
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And so they all gather together.

726
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 We're going, we are God's people.

727
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 There's victory that we have been given through God.

728
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And they start this processional, this parade, if you will.

729
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You are my God, verse 28, and I will praise you.

730
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 You are my God, and I will exalt you

731
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and give thanks to the Lord for he is good.

732
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 His love endures forever.

733
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 The David and the nation of Israel,

734
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 because of David's writing,

735
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 would gather together and say,

736
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 God, your love never stops.

737
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 You will never stop loving me

738
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 because I'm a part of your people.

739
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 You were the only protection in a world that is so broken

740
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 that will never fail and never falter.

741
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 You're the only thing that at the end of my days

742
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 will not crumble around me.

743
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Relationships may, my bank account may,

744
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 my job may, my children may,

745
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 my future spouse may, whatever it is,

746
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 but you never will.

747
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 You're the only thing that will,

748
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 and victory is mine no matter what happens, God.

749
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Through you, we win.

750
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Through you, we win.

751
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And they would gather together every year,

752
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 and they would sing this song,

753
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and they'd look back,

754
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 and the reason the nation of Israel would look back

755
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 and say, look, we know God's gonna come through.

756
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 We know he comes through.

757
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 He's a God no matter what we're facing right now.

758
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 We know God's coming through

759
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 is because they would look back,

760
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 and they'd point back to Passover,

761
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 the single event in the nation's history,

762
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 and they'd say, look, look at what happened.

763
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 We know God delivers his people.

764
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 We know that this took place.

765
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 We know he will come through for us.

766
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 And we, as followers of Christ,

767
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 if you're one of those,

768
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 we have a vantage point that is so much better than theirs,

769
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 because the reason you and I know

770
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 if you're facing a storm right now,

771
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 if you're facing trial,

772
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 when you face anxious times in life,

773
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 the reason you and I know

774
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 that God is a God who comes through,

775
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 and he will come through,

776
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 is not because of Passover,

777
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 and not just because of the words in this song,

778
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 but because of something else,

779
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 because of something else this song,

780
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 and even Passover,

781
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 always pointed to.

782
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 In other words, this psalm,

783
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 that's all about Passover, right?

784
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 It was sung at Passover.

785
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 This would be what they'd come together.

786
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 They'd sing this song.

787
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Hey, God's gonna come through for us.

788
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 They would sing this song at Passover.

789
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 It's all about Passover,

790
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 but it's not just about Passover.

791
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 There's clearly something else going on.

792
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 In fact, Passover is not just about Passover.

793
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 They're both about Jesus.

794
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Here's how we know that.

795
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Here's what I mean by that.

796
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Passover, when Jesus came together,

797
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 he told his disciples on his last night on earth,

798
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 where they came together,

799
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 and they came together for an event

800
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 that was called Passover.

801
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 They came together,

802
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 and Jesus on his last night together,

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 we call it the last supper,

804
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 if you've ever heard of the last supper,

805
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 where they'd come together,

806
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 and they'd have this meal together,

807
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 and Jesus and all of his boys,

808
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 they'd get together,

809
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 and Jesus begins to open

810
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 and begin to speak up about how Passover,

811
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 the psalms, it's all been pointing to Jesus.

812
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 It's all been about him,

813
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 and the reason why we can have great confidence

814
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 is not because of what God did in Exodus,

815
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 but because what God did after this last supper

816
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 and that meal on the cross.

817
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Jesus sits down at Passover,

818
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 where they would have gotten together,

819
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 they would have had this meal,

820
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 they would have had this cup of wine,

821
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 they would have had this dinner,

822
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 and then this cup of wine,

823
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 and then this bread,

824
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 that both all were symbolic of the Passover feast.

825
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 They were kind of a part of it.

826
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And Jesus gets them together,

827
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 and at the end of that feast,

828
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 they would have sang Psalm 118,

829
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Psalm 118, and he gets them together,

830
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 and he starts off by saying

831
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 that the psalm and all the psalms and Passover,

832
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 they weren't about Passover,

833
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 they were ultimately about me,

834
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 the spotless lamb,

835
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 that whoever by faith applies it to their life

836
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 will find protection and be passed over.

837
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 God will allow to experience life.

838
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Jesus says, "It was all about me."

839
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 He takes this cup,

840
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 and they're sitting at this meal,

841
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 and all the disciples had been little Jewish boys,

842
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 they'd sat through Passover dozens of times.

843
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 It'd be like you opening Christmas presents

844
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 on Christmas morning,

845
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 like you know how it works,

846
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 you know what's gonna take place next.

847
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 You got together,

848
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 and Jesus at this meal,

849
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 he doesn't say what normally took place at Passover.

850
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 He begins to go off the script.

851
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 He begins to say things that they'd never heard before.

852
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 In other words, they came together,

853
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 and he lifted up the cup,

854
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 and they'd seen the cup,

855
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 I mean, it was just, it's a part of the meal,

856
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 and he lifted up the cup,

857
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 and he didn't say what you were supposed to say,

858
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 which is this,

859
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 "Lord, oh merciful one,

860
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 "make us worthy to live in the days of the Mashiach."

861
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Allow us to be the Mashiach, the Messiah.

862
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Allow us to be worthy enough, Lord,

863
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 to live in the days of the Messiah.

864
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Jesus takes the cup,

865
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and he looks at his boys in the face

866
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 and the Passover meal,

867
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 and he says, "This is about me,

868
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 "and my blood that will be shed for you,

869
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 "and the new covenant that will be established

870
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 "by what I'm about to do on the cross,

871
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 "and then he takes this bread,

872
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 "and he begins to say,

873
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 "This is not what they would have heard normally,

874
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 "would be this is the bread of affliction

875
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 "that our ancestors ate as they left Egypt,

876
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 "and he says, "This bread has always been about me.

877
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 "This is my body, broken so that you don't have to be."

878
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 That he displays the unending love of God,

879
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 the protection of God,

880
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 the victory that would come through God,

881
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 dying on the cross,

882
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 and he says, "This is about me.

883
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 "It's always been about me.

884
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 "Passover, think about it.

885
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 "The time where God allows the firstborn spotless lamb

886
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 "to be killed, and anyone who accepts

887
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 "the provision of that and puts it over their life

888
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 "will by faith live.

889
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 "They will be passed over and have life.

890
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 "The spotless lamb of Jesus,

891
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 "whose blood was shed,

892
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 "and anyone who accepts the protection that he extends

893
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 "freely will experience life,

894
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 "and will be passed over from the wrath of God.

895
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 "It's always been about me," he says,

896
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 and he looks at them,

897
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and then as they begin to sing the psalm

898
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 that they would have heard and sang all the time,

899
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 all of a sudden it has to eclipse.

900
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 Jesus, the Son of God,

901
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 begins singing out this psalm, 118.

902
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 He begins referring as he leans back and sings out,

903
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 "The love of God endures forever,

904
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 "and I'm about to go show it on the cross."

905
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 And the Son of God sings out loud,

906
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 "The love of God endures forever,

907
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 "the love of God endures forever,

908
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 "the love of God endures forever."

909
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 And his disciples, who had no idea

910
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 the fullness of everything that Jesus was saying,

911
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 as he's about to display,

912
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 "It's always been about me.

913
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 "The psalm has always been about me,

914
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 "and me displaying there's no end

915
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 "to which I will not go to show you that I love you.

916
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 "There's no thing that can come against my protection

917
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 "for those who will accept it.

918
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 "There's no thing that can stop my victory,

919
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 "because whoever trusts in me, in Christ, we win."

920
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 And he sings as he leans back and sings a song.

921
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Matthew 26, 30 says this,

922
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 that Jesus sang a hymn,

923
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 and they went out to the Mount of Olives.

924
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 All scholars today, they still will sing psalm 118

925
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 at the end of the Passover meal.

926
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 And Jesus just laid out, "It's always been about me."

927
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 The reason we have confidence God will come through

928
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 is because he already has in Christ.

929
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And so no matter what we face,

930
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 he invites us to turn to him,

931
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 invites us to experience just the blessing

932
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 of living in relationship,

933
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 but we rest in the fact that no matter what comes our way,

934
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 we're gonna make it, we're gonna be okay,

935
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 whether that's in this life or the next,

936
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 no matter what, we win.

937
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 The whole psalm, I mean, think about it.

938
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Lay out the palm branches, it had to have clicked.

939
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 And here's how we know the psalm 118 clicked.

940
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Oh my gosh, for the disciples,

941
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 the men sitting at the table,

942
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 maybe it was after Jesus rose from the dead

943
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 that this has always been about Jesus.

944
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.

945
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 The stone that builders or the leaders crucified

946
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 became the cornerstone?

947
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 It became the stone that was first laid,

948
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 the firstborn, the stone on which every other stone rests.

949
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 And if you remove that stone, the whole thing crumbles,

950
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 but it is that thing that holds everything else in place,

951
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 it's about Jesus.

952
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And at some point, the men sitting around that table,

953
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 it all clicked.

954
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 The reason we know that is six different times it appears.

955
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone

956
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 or become the cornerstone.

957
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Six different times, Peter and all the boys,

958
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 they write, the writers of the New Testament write out,

959
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 it's always been about Jesus.

960
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And we have confidence now in this life.

961
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 We have confidence that we know his love endures forever

962
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 because of what happened when Jesus,

963
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 after he leaned back and he sang out the words,

964
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 "Let the nation of Israel say, 'His love endures forever.'

965
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 "Let the priesthood say, 'His love endures forever.'

966
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 "Let all who fear the Lord say, 'His love endures forever.'

967
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 "Because I'm gonna walk out overwhelmed

968
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 "to the point of grief, and I'm going to die

969
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 "so there is no end, that I, the God of the universe,

970
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 "will not go to pay the price for those whom I love

971
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 "to remain in covenant.

972
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 "I will not stop loving you,

973
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 "and anyone who will accept my protection

974
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 "will be able to say for all of their days,

975
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 "no matter what happens, we win.

976
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 "No matter what I face, I'm gonna make it."

977
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 And in the end, we win, and we win through Christ.

978
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 If you don't know that God, if you don't know that message,

979
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 that's the meaning of Christianity.

980
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 That's the meaning of everything inside of your Bible.

981
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 It's always been pointing to Jesus.

982
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 And Jesus is a God who doesn't look at you and say,

983
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 "Why don't you get it together already?"

984
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 He's a God who says, "Look, I will die for you on a cross.

985
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 "I will pay, and in doing so, I will pay for your sins.

986
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 "I will pay the debt that you deserve to pay.

987
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 "I will die the death that you deserve to die.

988
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 "I'll live the life you cannot live,

989
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 "and if you will just by faith

990
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 "accept that Jesus paid for my sin,

991
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 "you will live forever, and you will say,

992
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 "with all the saints for eternity, we win.

993
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 "And no matter what happens, we win.

994
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 "No matter what we face, we win.

995
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 "Neither death, life, nor anything else

996
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 "in all creation, tribulation, famine, distress,"

997
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 as Romans 8 says, "can separate us from Christ.

998
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 "We win, and we exhale now,

999
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 "knowing that you are the God who comes through,

1000
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 "because you already have, and you will come again,

1001
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 "and you've already paid, and through you, we win."

1002
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 If you don't know that God, I'm gonna pray that you would.

1003
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 We'd love to talk to you about it.

1004
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 That's why we do everything that you see here.

1005
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 That's why every psalm was written.

1006
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 That's why all of life, all of your life exists.

1007
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 That's the meaning for which you were born.

1008
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 I'm gonna pray that you would.

1009
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Father, thank you for the psalms.

1010
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 Thank you for David.

1011
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Thank you for the writings

1012
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 of just men who loved you, and who knew you,

1013
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 and who through their writings,

1014
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 we are able to know you better.

1015
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Thank you.

1016
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 God, thank you for Jesus.

1017
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Thank you for Jesus.

1018
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Thank you for the Passover lamb,

1019
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 the true one whose blood was shed

1020
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 so that mine would not have to be.

1021
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 And who did so not because of a reluctance or an obligation,

1022
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 because he really loves us.

1023
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 You love us with a love that for your people never stops,

1024
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 and provides a protection that never fails,

1025
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 and through which we can have confidence to say,

1026
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 "We win, no matter what comes my way."

1027
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 "What comes my way, and I don't know what that will be, Lord."

1028
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 Would you allow us to walk by faith and say,

1029
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 "We win in this life and the next."

1030
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 And to be men who trust in that lamb,

1031
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 who trust in the meaning of Passover,

1032
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 Jesus, the meaning of Psalm 118.

1033
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 Amen.
