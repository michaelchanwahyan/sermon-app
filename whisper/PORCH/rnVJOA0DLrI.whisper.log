[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:28.640]   - Well, welcome to the porch.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.560]   My name is Josiah.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.000]   I haven't met you, I hope to meet you at some point.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720]   Man, it is good to be back.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.320]   Let's go, Porch Live.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.560]   Porch Live Cincinnati, if you're tuning in,
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.960]   which I know you are.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.720]   Porch Live Scottsdale, Houston, Austin, El Paso,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.000]   man, Indianapolis, and a host of other locations
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.460]   jumping on with us tonight.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.360]   Welcome.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.680]   We've been in a series titled Fortune Telling.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.000]   Words from the past that tell about our future.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.920]   And over the last few weeks,
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.560]   we've been answering questions,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.200]   pretty important questions.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.080]   Questions like, will I ever truly be forgiven?
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.040]   Will I be alone forever?
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.080]   Some of that's all too true for some of you tonight.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.800]   That was for me too.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000]   31 is when I got married, so there's hope.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.920]   Will I go to heaven when I die?
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.800]   Like that was a question we answered.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.720]   And then last week, JP came up here and he said,
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.240]   "Hey, who am I going to marry?"
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.720]   I mean, if you weren't here last week,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.080]   you gotta check that out.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.560]   Tonight, we're pulling up to the last week of the series.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.800]   And we're going to answer the question,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   what is my purpose?
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.000]   What is my purpose?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And so let me start out by asking a question.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.640]   Y'all ever feel out of place?
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.520]   Anyone, anyone ever feel out of place in life?
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.360]   Yeah, a few of you.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.880]   Okay, about 10, that's good.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.600]   But seriously, we don't know each other very well.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.260]   So I'm gonna let you in on my life.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.520]   I grew up homeschooled.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.360]   Thanks, mom.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.180]   Appreciate that.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.120]   Oh, we got some homeschoolers in the house, okay.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.320]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.680]   But listen, y'all, come on,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.800]   let's just be honest, I'm a homeschoolers, man.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.520]   Like, listen, I was awkward.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.880]   Like, it was bad.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.160]   And then I made that transition into public school
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.620]   my middle school years.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.960]   And man, I had girls like handing me notes in the hallway,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.600]   I guess because they liked my puka shell necklace
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.720]   or frosted tips.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.380]   I think we got a picture of it on the screen.
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.920]   There we go, oh my gosh.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.000]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.400]   Hey, haters are gonna hate.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.960]   (laughing)
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.200]   Haters are gonna hate.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.680]   JD said, "Man, you just look like a wannabe
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.040]   "on One Tree Hill."
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.560]   And I'm like, "Come on, JD.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.120]   "Man, that ain't right."
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.920]   But listen, man, they would give me these notes
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.760]   in the hallway and I'm like,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.160]   "What do I even do with these things?
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.560]   "The only girls I ever went to school with
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.400]   "were my sisters."
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   You know, like, that's weird if they would write me notes.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.520]   I mean, no.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.440]   And so, listen, that was true for me.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.940]   I just kinda felt out of place.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.780]   I'm like, "I don't think I'm supposed to be here."
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.040]   And so tonight, that was me.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.200]   What about you?
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.480]   You ever felt out of place?
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.560]   Like, maybe it was going to your girlfriend's house
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.000]   over the holidays, meeting the parents,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.840]   you know, that one thing,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.720]   and you had her brother sizing you up.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.560]   That was me.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.160]   I've got some stories.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.240]   Maybe you guys, y'all going to yoga for the first time
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.440]   with your girlfriend 'cause you're just trying
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.280]   to impress her.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.160]   And let's just be honest, like, that's just,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.680]   there's nothing comfortable about that, okay?
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   But you're doing your thing.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.560]   Or maybe some of you, you come into the church,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.120]   you're smelling like smoke or smelling like alcohol,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.800]   and you're just like, "Man, I just feel out of place
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.640]   "in this thing."
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.680]   And ladies, like, "Is my hair okay?
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.560]   "Are my clothes churchy enough?"
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.660]   You know?
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.520]   And you just kinda feel out of place.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.600]   Or maybe you come into this place and someone says,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   "Hey, you wanna go to the porch tonight?"
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.440]   You're like, "Yeah."
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.600]   But you thought the porch was that restaurant
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.480]   and bar in Uptown, and then they brought you here,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.760]   and you find yourself, and you're like,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.560]   "Man, they're raising their hands.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.520]   "They're singing these songs.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.080]   "And they're just, man, they're opening their Bibles.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.840]   "Like, I see the girls taking notes.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.800]   "Like, get them a notebook."
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.280]   And I'm like, "This is awkward.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.320]   "This is not my place.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.680]   "This is not my crowd."
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.720]   And so, listen, listen.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.760]   I start there tonight because this is what I know.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.640]   If you don't know your purpose,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.880]   then you will inevitably feel out of place.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.320]   Like, do you catch that?
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.100]   Like, if you don't know your purpose,
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.680]   then you will inevitably feel out of place.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.360]   And tonight, man, many of us,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   we're driving through this thing called life.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.440]   We're chasing this job, this salary, this girl, this guy,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.560]   this drug, this club.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.720]   And listen, we think it's gonna give us purpose,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.000]   but it only leaves us feeling empty.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.520]   And we chase after these things
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.960]   that we think are gonna give us purpose,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.040]   and then we just change.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.760]   Like, "Oh, that didn't really give me purpose,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.200]   "so let me just change the pursuit,"
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.360]   thinking that that's gonna help.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.960]   And you find yourself in this kind of this
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.040]   treadmill of stupidity, no offense,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.440]   just trying to keep it real.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.300]   See, I believe the greatest tragedy
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.920]   is a person living their life
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.200]   and missing out on their purpose,
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.740]   never stopping once to ask God,
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.120]   "Why am I created?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.340]   "Like, what's my purpose?
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.220]   "Why am I here?"
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.460]   And so, man, to stand before God and for Him to say,
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.600]   "Hey, yeah, you did all these things,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.200]   "but you missed out on the one thing
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.300]   "that was gonna give you purpose in all of these things.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.680]   "You wasted them."
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.620]   This is why in the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.520]   the book of wisdom, as many call it,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.500]   it says that He, God, has planted eternity
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.240]   on the hearts of every man and every woman.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.940]   Ecclesiastes 3.11, He has planted eternity
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.680]   in the heart of every human.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.060]   And you know this to be true,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.960]   like deep down, we know this.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.580]   Like, we go to bed at night and we ask,
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.120]   "Hey, what is my purpose?"
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.720]   There's got to be something more.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.000]   Some of you, man, you've achieved your goals
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.460]   or you achieved some of them, and you're like, "That's it?"
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.860]   You're like Tom Brady, man.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.900]   Tom Brady did an interview with 60 Minutes
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.640]   in 2005 after he won his third Super Bowl.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.520]   And he literally says, quote, this is what he says.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.400]   He says, "Man, why do I have three Super Bowl rings
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.160]   "and still believe that there's something greater
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   "out there for me?"
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.480]   Yeah, there's got to be something more.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.280]   And this is what I would say,
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.520]   hey, Tom, if you're watching, which I don't think you are,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.720]   there is.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.360]   There's more.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.480]   Why are you here?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.200]   What is your purpose in life?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.240]   And tonight I want to answer that.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.080]   You ready for this?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.900]   Like, it's real simple.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.040]   I know you're gonna be like, "Oh, that's churchy."
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.240]   But it couldn't be any more true.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.080]   Your purpose in life, my purpose in life,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.480]   is to know Jesus and to make him known.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.800]   Like, that's it.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.920]   That's where we're headed tonight,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.080]   to know Jesus and to make him known.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.120]   And there's a God who's the author of life,
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.300]   and he has these purposes for your life,
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.720]   and he loves you too much to let you pursue
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.540]   any other purpose in which you were made.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.540]   This is why your heart is beating tonight.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.340]   This is why you have oxygen in your lungs.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.860]   This is why you showed up at the porch tonight.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.220]   March, I think it's the ninth, 2021.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.220]   So that you would intersect with this message
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.580]   and it would change your life forever.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.220]   But you know who needs this message more than anyone?
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.660]   It's me.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.940]   Because I forget it.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.380]   I forget this message.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.740]   And so tonight we're gonna be in Philippians chapter three.
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.900]   Philippians is towards the end of your Bible.
[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.840]   It's Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.740]   first and second Corinthians, Galatians,
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.900]   and then you'll pull up to Philippians.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.660]   And we're gonna look at a guy named Paul,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.060]   who found his purpose in his resume,
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.420]   until he met Christ.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.700]   We're gonna be in Philippians three,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.500]   starting in verse three, here we go.
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.820]   "We put no confidence in human effort,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.380]   "though I could have confidence in my own effort
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.020]   "if anyone could."
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.380]   That's, like, and then he goes on and says,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.860]   "Indeed, if others have reason for confidence
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.700]   "in their own efforts, I have even more."
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.000]   It sounds a little arrogant, just being honest.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.700]   Then Paul goes through his resume.
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.760]   "I was circumcised on the eighth day.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.460]   "I'm a pure-blooded citizen of Israel,
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.000]   "a member of the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.480]   "a real Hebrew, if there ever was one.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.920]   "I'm a member of the Pharisees
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.580]   "who demanded the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.540]   "I was zealous that I harshly persecuted the church.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.400]   "As for righteousness, man,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.940]   "I obeyed the law without fault."
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.260]   Man, I'm faultless.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.660]   Here's what that means, because we look at that
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.300]   and we're like, man, that's kind of weird language,
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.060]   but let me modernize it for you.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.340]   Because we read this and we're like,
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.740]   what does this even mean?
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.500]   He says, hey, talk about family.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.720]   I was born to the noble parents.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.100]   They got connections everywhere.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.280]   You talk about education, Baylor, A&M,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.060]   no, no, no, no, Ivy League, yeah, whoop, whatever.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.020]   Ivy League.
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.780]   No, no, no, Ivy League
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.980]   with honors.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.420]   You want to talk about power?
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.180]   Man, I have authority over my enemies.
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.020]   I can persecute them.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.920]   You want to talk about religion?
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.140]   I've never missed a Sunday.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.660]   I know more Bible than you have forgotten.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.700]   You want to talk about money?
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.800]   You want to talk about status?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.100]   You want to talk about stuff?
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.920]   I win.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.940]   You want to talk about respect?
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.100]   Man, I got older guys calling me.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.400]   He begins to list out his resume.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.620]   Let me ask you, what are you holding on to
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.780]   to give you purpose?
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.900]   Like, what did you come into this place with?
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.780]   What are you holding on to to give you purpose?
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.180]   That college athlete, the guy or girl you're dating,
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.220]   that six-figure job, your corner office, the promotion,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.980]   your body, your good looks,
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   like you're hanging on to those things?
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.540]   Your Instagram followers,
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.480]   what are you holding on to to give you purpose tonight?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.380]   Then he turns everything that he just said
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.180]   about his resume on its head
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.020]   when it comes to finding our purpose.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.820]   Verse seven, I once thought these things were valuable,
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.420]   like that word circled valuable right there,
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.760]   but now I consider them, what, worthless
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.700]   because of what Christ has done.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.580]   Verse eight, yes, everything else is worthless
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.580]   when compared with the infinite value
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.500]   of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.740]   There it is.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.380]   For his sake, I have discarded everything else,
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.740]   counting it as garbage.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.340]   This Greek word for garbage is skrupula.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.100]   It's where we get the word crap,
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.140]   like just being honest, a four-letter word, crap.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.740]   Like he's saying everything else is trash
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.660]   compared to the infinite value of knowing Jesus.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   All the stuff that Paul gained in his life, garbage,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.420]   compared to knowing Christ.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.660]   So what's your purpose?
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.220]   Know Jesus.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.800]   Point number one, know Jesus.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.500]   But where should I work, Josiah?
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.140]   Should I take this job or that job?
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.260]   I don't know.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.140]   Which one's gonna help you know Jesus
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.740]   and make him known the most?
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.820]   Like some of you, you're pursuing the job that you have
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.940]   because you're so caught up with the salary,
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.660]   and listen, you're miserable.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.660]   In the purpose, but your end is that salary.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.700]   And we know that money isn't going to buy happiness.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.820]   It's not gonna buy purpose.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.420]   You know that to be the fact.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.960]   You know that to be the truth.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   Just look at Hollywood, man.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.420]   It's the most miserable place in the world.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.700]   Am I gonna get married or stay single?
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.300]   I don't know, listen to JP's message last week.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.000]   You'll probably know.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.260]   Just being honest.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.180]   No, no, no, you should honor him.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.300]   Like you can be married and miss out on your purpose,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.180]   or you can be single and miss out on your purpose,
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.900]   but married or single, if you live to know Jesus
[00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:09.740]   and make him known,
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.180]   you're not gonna live a life without purpose.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.140]   Man, that's a promise, money back guaranteed.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.900]   Like nobody's gonna get to heaven, I promise you this.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.100]   Nobody's gonna get to heaven and be like,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.340]   God, what's up with that, man?
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.580]   I was single down here.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.420]   Like you couldn't even have a guy ask me out.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.260]   Like what's up with that?
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.700]   Like do you not care?
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.460]   Like in a million years,
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.620]   no one's gonna get to heaven and say that.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:39.440]   Streets of gold, but I couldn't even have a family.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:46.540]   No one's gonna walk up to you and be like,
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.720]   single Susan, like you never got married?
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.600]   Single Steve, what's up, man?
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.860]   Like no one's gonna do that.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.480]   Sometimes the English language falls short
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.960]   to define words in its entirety.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.420]   Like the word no here in Philippians chapter three,
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.980]   this word no in the Greek,
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.360]   it's described in three ways.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.540]   This word no.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.240]   Doxa is one way.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.600]   Doxa is to know something through the grapevine.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.000]   It's like hearsay.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.240]   And Paul's not saying, hey, I wanna doxa Jesus.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.380]   I just wanna know about Jesus through the grapevine,
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.200]   through someone else's experience.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.400]   Number two, episteme, episteme.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.840]   This is where you know something through book knowledge.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.560]   Like you just, you read your Bible and you have a few facts
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.680]   or you go to seminary and you get filled with some knowledge
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.520]   or you read some Christian books
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.760]   and you have those facts about Jesus.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.880]   Paul doesn't use that word here.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.080]   Paul uses the Greek word gnosis.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.340]   Gnosis, it means like you know through experience.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.240]   You don't know how something,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.320]   you don't know how good something tastes
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.720]   unless it sinks into your teeth, right?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.160]   Like the first time I had steak, like amazing.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.680]   Like I'm not talking about steak from Longhorn, man, no.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.000]   Or whatever, Ruth Chris.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.680]   You're like, it's Longhorn, I don't do that.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.800]   This is Dallas.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.360]   No, hey, no, no, listen, listen.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.920]   The first time I had steak,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.200]   my brother-in-law's a farmer, he raises cows.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.440]   Like he sent me an entire cow.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.600]   Like that was an experience, y'all.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.460]   Like a party going on in your mouth, right?
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.480]   No, this is what Paul is saying here.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.180]   Like I wanna know Christ through experience.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.080]   The purpose of my life is to know Christ
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   in a way where I've experienced.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:32.080]   I've tasted God, I've tasted Christ, and he's good, y'all.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.000]   Let me ask you, do you know Jesus?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.400]   Like not doxa, not, I know Jesus through people,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.400]   I'm kinda hearsay, not episteme
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.920]   where you know about some books
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.040]   or you read tweets from a friend
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.800]   that loves Jesus really, really well
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.580]   and it kinda inspires you for the day.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.460]   But do you know Jesus?
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.240]   Gnosis, where you've experienced him.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.160]   Like your life's been changed
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.480]   because you've experienced him for yourself
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.760]   in a way that your life has been changed
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.380]   and people, man, listen, they see it, it's tangible.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.180]   Let me just be honest with you tonight.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.960]   If you don't know Jesus, man, you're gonna spend your life
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.400]   on the endless treadmill pursuing highs and lows,
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.320]   get to 85, and then you're gonna end up in the dirt.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.140]   That's the outcome.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.440]   That's what Paul's saying tonight.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.260]   More importantly, it's what the God of the universe,
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.060]   the God of the galaxies, sovereign over everything
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.380]   is saying to you and I tonight.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.460]   Paul continues in verse nine.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.820]   He says, "I no longer count on my own righteousness
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.300]   "through obeying the law.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.180]   "Rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.460]   "For God's way of making us right with himself
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.940]   "depends on faith."
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.340]   Another question I have for you tonight is
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.640]   have you received the righteousness that comes from God
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.620]   based on faith?
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.520]   Not based on your good works.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.340]   This past weekend, we got a new furnace.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.740]   AC and furnace guy, heater guy came over to the house.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.060]   He was doing his final inspection
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.320]   and he's like that guy from New York,
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.580]   he's like kind of rough and tough
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.180]   and I'm like kind of sizing him up.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.540]   Like, oh, you got, okay.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.260]   I'll talk to you when we get to the driveway.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.740]   You seem kind of intimidating.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.540]   You're like, you kind of intimidate me a little bit.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.980]   So we walked out after he did his final inspection.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.940]   I just said, "Hey, Terry.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.560]   "Hey, bro, I got a question for you.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.260]   "Hey, before you go, man, we've had some great conversations.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.980]   "Thanks for sharing your story."
[00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.820]   That's what I did.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.660]   I just said, "Hey, man, what's your story?"
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.380]   He began to go into it.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   I said, "Hey, Terry.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.220]   "Hey, do you have a faith?"
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.920]   He said, "Ah, I'm a non-practicing Catholic."
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.880]   I'm like, non-practice, I don't even know what that means,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.080]   but I didn't say that.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.920]   But I was like, "Oh, okay.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.480]   "So Terry, hey, like I've been pondering this question.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.520]   "It's not really unique to you.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.360]   "I ask it to a lot of different people.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.520]   "But if I was to ask you, Terry, who goes to heaven?
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.680]   "What would you say?"
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.040]   He thought about it for a minute
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.040]   and he said, "Those people that do good works."
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.340]   I said, "Man, I appreciate your honesty.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.980]   "I thought that way for a long time."
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.820]   And at this point, man, I'm like,
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.180]   "What's going on?
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.640]   "Did I say everything?
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.620]   "Like he might get mad."
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.260]   And I'm like, "Hey, Terry, here's another question.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.760]   "If we get to heaven based on our good works,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.100]   "how do you know if you've done enough good work?"
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.540]   He said, "Oh, man, I never really thought about that.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.700]   "I guess you don't."
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.300]   And I said, "A second question, Terry.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.660]   "If you can get to heaven based on your own works,
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.100]   "what was the point of Jesus dying on the cross?"
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.200]   And I said, "Terry, can I just tell you something, man?
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.580]   "Like there's a God in heaven and he loves you.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:05.600]   "And he looked down on you and me 2,021 years ago
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.180]   "because he didn't see fit to leave you and me in our sin.
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.420]   "And perfection left heaven
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.780]   "and it collided with imperfection.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.900]   "And he went through agony for you, man.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.920]   "He went to the cross.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.340]   "His perfection went to the cross
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.900]   "and he took on our imperfection."
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.940]   And I said, "Those nails that were in his hands, man.
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.980]   "Hey, Terry, Terry, those nails in his hands
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.500]   "were every time your hands and my hands
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.700]   "have been to places that they should never have gone."
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.700]   I said, "The nail in his feet, Terry."
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.320]   I said, "It's for every time we've taken our feet to places
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.160]   "that should never have gone.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.100]   "Hey, the crown of thorns that sits right above your eyes,
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.420]   "Terry, or right above Christ's eyes, right?
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.100]   "It's for every time you looked at thing,
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.760]   "every time I looked at something
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.800]   "or I thought of something
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.980]   "that I shouldn't have looked at or thought of."
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.300]   The hatred in your heart, the adultery in your heart,
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.900]   the lust that you have towards women.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.140]   Man, I got it too, bro.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.580]   I said, "The way they whipped Jesus
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.060]   "before he went to the cross,
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.680]   "at the end of whips were glass
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.620]   "and sharp metal objects and nails.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.200]   "And they whipped him and they pulled out chunks of flesh
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   "for every time you and I have turned our back against God."
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.280]   I said, "Terry, if you could get to heaven
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.260]   "based on your good works,
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.980]   "what was the point of Jesus doing all that?"
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.020]   There was no point, man.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.640]   He knew that you couldn't do enough good things
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.700]   to get to him.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.260]   That's why he had to come down.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.440]   Do you know that Jesus, Terry?
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.880]   Tonight, do you know that kind of Jesus?
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.620]   Do you know that God tonight
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.500]   who left heaven and went to the cross for you and me,
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.280]   died a sinner's death?
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.580]   History records and scripture says three days later,
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.820]   he rose again from the dead to defeat sin and death.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.500]   And when you put your faith not in your good works,
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.560]   Terry, or porch tonight,
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.380]   but you put your faith in Christ,
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.540]   he forgives your sin and he changes your heart
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.940]   and not only your heart, but your entire life.
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.940]   Do you know that God?
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.180]   Do you know that God?
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.520]   Listen, I'm not naive.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.020]   Like, I'm not.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.380]   To think that the wrong that you brought into this place,
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.980]   anything that you brought into this place,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.340]   like, and I've probably done too,
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.220]   like, that's my story.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.780]   I was playing college baseball
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.620]   and chasing the party and alcohol
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.060]   and women and pornography.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.540]   Not proud of it.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.820]   That's just my life, man.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.460]   And then I collided with this message
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.600]   that I just shared with you.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.980]   It's the gospel, the good news of Jesus.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.740]   And he repurposed me.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.980]   And listen, I didn't find life until I lost my life.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.380]   Matthew 16, 25 says,
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.060]   "If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.460]   But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it."
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.780]   And you're like, no, man, you're naive, Josiah.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.620]   No, I'm not, man.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.840]   Life is found in Christ, I promise you.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.680]   You're missing out.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.500]   Like, you're stuck in the same routine,
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.900]   expecting different results.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.580]   Sin's robbing you of creativity.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.020]   You go back to the bar, you get drunk,
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.540]   and you're hitting repeat on the weekend.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.380]   Like, that's not life.
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.420]   That's quite old, man.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.180]   It gets old.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.340]   Like, waking up to strangers, hugging the toilet,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.300]   taking that pregnancy.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.100]   Like, come on, you know that.
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.900]   But you keep going back to the same thing,
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.020]   expecting a different result.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.120]   That was my life until Christ changed it.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.560]   That's why Paul continues in verse 12.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.140]   And he says this,
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.660]   "I don't mean that I've already achieved these things,
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.460]   that I've already reached perfection."
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.860]   I love that.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.940]   Like, some of you coming into this place,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.900]   you know, Christians, they just think they're perfect.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.400]   And no, man, that's the furthest thing.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.060]   But we know the one who is perfect,
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.900]   and we're chasing after him.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.740]   And so Paul says,
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.180]   "Not that I've already achieved perfection,
[00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.860]   but I press on to possess the perfection
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.700]   for which Christ Jesus first possessed in me.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.020]   No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.340]   but I focus on one thing, one thing.
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.460]   What's that one thing?
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.700]   I forget the past, and I look forward to what lies ahead.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.820]   I press on to reach the end of the race
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.440]   and receive the heavenly prize
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.540]   for which God through Christ Jesus is calling us."
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.520]   Life is in Jesus, friends.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.140]   Like, some of you, man, you're stuck in your shame
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.660]   and your guilt and condemnation,
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.380]   and it's keeping you down.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.900]   And Christ would say, "Hey, I died for that thing.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.620]   Quit replaying the tapes.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:58.300]   Quit thinking that that has to keep you from knowing me.
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.660]   That's why I went to the cross.
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.800]   There was a separation, there was a chasm,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.780]   but I bridged that chasm, and I love you."
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.980]   And if you ever doubt that, man, just look at the cross.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.100]   If you ever doubt that love,
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.440]   would you be fixated on what Christ did for you on the cross?
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.660]   Listen, I haven't only lived this, man, I've seen it.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.580]   Like, young adults are running after the world.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.900]   They think they have everything going for them,
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.580]   and then all of a sudden, Christ intersects their life,
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.620]   and they change, he begins to change their purposes.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.520]   They begin to filter everything they do
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.980]   and how they can know Christ, and they can make him known.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.700]   What's gonna honor him with my life, with my decisions,
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.520]   with my relationships, with my successes?
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.700]   They begin to really live life.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.340]   There's a few people I want you to meet tonight.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.580]   Meet my friend Kat.
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.460]   This is what she says, "Apart from Christ,
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.340]   I thought my purpose was to make it in corporate America.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.780]   I wanted to use my talents to appear successful
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.460]   before others and chase the highs of life.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.540]   More specifically, I was chasing materialism,
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.380]   the party scene, and alcohol.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.140]   But now that Christ has changed my life,
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.540]   I find every part of my identity and purpose in him.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.060]   The worldly satisfaction of highs I was chasing
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.180]   have been replaced by a loving relationship with God,
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.020]   his people, and his mission."
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.880]   Meet my friend Kyle.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.700]   "Before Christ, I thought I'd find purpose
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.380]   in being able to provide for myself
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.220]   with a lifestyle that marked comfortability
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.500]   and independence as a former SMU football player
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.300]   and frat guy.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.100]   I thought Christians were weird, weak, and boring.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.620]   I wanted to live a comfortable life
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.260]   and call the shots and be the man, but it was exhausting.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.980]   These pursuits only led to empty wells
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.940]   that always ran dry.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.340]   Sure, there was temporal highs,
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.980]   but never anything sustaining.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:54.040]   The purpose found in knowing God and making him known
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.760]   was one of the greatest blessings I've ever experienced.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.640]   I surrendered my life to Christ
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.080]   and put his ways above the world's ways,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   and everything began to change."
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.300]   Meet my friend Leslie.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.580]   "I used to live for the approval of other people,
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.280]   but when I did, my heart always ached for something more.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.060]   I wanted to be thinner, more beautiful, and more loved.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.400]   I thought that Miss Texas, that crown,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.240]   would give me status and purpose,
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.640]   but God helped me see that the only thing I needed
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.720]   to find joy in and affirmation and value in
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.760]   was an abiding relationship with him.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.920]   Now that I'm a daughter of the king,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.960]   I've received a gift of grace,
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.800]   and it's so much more beautiful and eternally valuable
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.120]   than I could ever imagine.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.360]   My purpose shifted from glorifying myself
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.900]   to glorifying the one who matters.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:45.220]   I spent my time starving myself before photo shoots,
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.140]   but now I have purpose in serving Christ.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.560]   I get to do that every week at the porch."
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:51.400]   Meet my friend Joe.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.080]   "Before Christ, I was marked by two fleeting purposes.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.420]   The first, career success.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.160]   If I just had a good job, increasing levels of control
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.080]   and power, and of course, more money.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.200]   The second purpose, to have a lot of friends.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.800]   I wanted to be so liked.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   I wanted to be seen.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.720]   I want to be known.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.840]   That's the biggest reason why I identified as bisexual
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.240]   for almost six years.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.120]   I didn't want anything to prohibit me
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.000]   from people potentially liking me or showing me affection.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.720]   My life mantra was to work hard, play harder,
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.480]   play with as many friends as possible,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.680]   and my purpose is fed into that perfectly.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.320]   But then Christ redefined my purpose,
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.880]   to know him and to make him known,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.680]   to share the good news of God's grace through Jesus
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.920]   by serving others and putting their needs above my own."
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:43.620]   Listen, friends, those are real people with real problems,
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.020]   but they have a real purpose.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.920]   Like those people are here tonight.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.240]   They serve week in and week out,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.400]   this gathering that we call The Porch.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.640]   And listen, there'll be a team of people and myself,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.760]   these people that you just heard their stories
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.440]   right here after service.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.840]   And if you don't believe it, man, come and talk to them.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   And they can share way more than I ever did.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.080]   And now for you, let me ask you, fill in the blank.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.320]   My name is blank.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.480]   My problem is blank.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.040]   And my purpose is blank.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.940]   And tonight, if you don't know the answer to that purpose,
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.460]   then tonight, come listen, I'm begging you,
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.380]   I'm pleading with you.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.500]   Like I said, I don't get paid anymore.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.380]   If you come to Christ, like I'm asking you tonight,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.960]   would you consider Christ?
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:37.020]   Would you consider knowing him and making him known?
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.260]   Once you know Jesus and you have no choice
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.500]   than to make him known, which is point number two,
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.020]   make Jesus known.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.260]   The same guy in Philippians 3, Paul,
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.300]   he goes on and says in Acts 20, 24,
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.540]   it's my life verse.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.700]   I mean, call it cheesy, whatever you want,
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.140]   but this is what Paul says.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.580]   He says, "But my life is worth nothing to me."
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.420]   What?
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.380]   Like that's crazy.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.340]   Every time I read that, nothing, Paul?
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.940]   Like, what do you mean your life is worth nothing to me?
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.780]   Look at what he says.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.340]   "But my life is worth nothing to me
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.780]   unless I use it for," what?
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.580]   "Finishing the work assigned to me by my Lord Jesus,
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.540]   the work of telling others the good news," about what?
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.020]   His wonderful grace.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.980]   His wonderful grace.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.980]   You are made, you were born to know him
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.940]   and to make him known through your job.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.140]   You're born to make him known
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.620]   through your apartment complex.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.240]   You make him known through your relationships.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.180]   And because of my position here at the staff,
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.100]   like listen, I get a front row seat
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.840]   to watch Christ intersect the lives of young adults
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.740]   here in Dallas, not just here in Dallas,
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.860]   all over the nation, in Houston,
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:49.580]   in rural Ballaton, Minnesota, in Philadelphia,
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.020]   in Scottsdale, in Indianapolis.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.140]   I see you, come on.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.420]   And God is using young adults all over the world
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.860]   to be mobilized, to be equipped, to share this message.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   It's like God gives young adults a key.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:10.540]   And that key is their testimony, their story of grace,
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.380]   how he's repurposed them.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.940]   And that key is the gospel, the good news of Jesus.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.540]   And these young adults begin to live life
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.180]   and they begin to live on mission.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.020]   And they go and they look at other people
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.780]   and they interact with other people
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.580]   that are sitting in the same prisons
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.740]   that they used to sit in.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.780]   And they take that key, their testimony in the gospel,
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.180]   and they begin to unlock those prisons
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.720]   that they used to sit in.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.800]   Like it's crazy, y'all.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.260]   Like that is life, that is incredible.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.100]   There's nothing on the face of the planet
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.780]   that can change a human heart than Christ.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:49.740]   And we're seeing God move all over the nation and world.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.420]   And listen, if you're longing to be a part of something
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.660]   bigger than yourself,
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.980]   something that's changing the world, let's go.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.480]   Listen, Satan, man, he's real.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.280]   Like his MO is to steal, kill, and destroy.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.940]   The Bible says he prowls around like a roaring lion
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.300]   seeking those he can devour.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.300]   And listen, some of you are being devoured tonight.
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.060]   Let me just be real.
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.140]   Like I was.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.660]   Thinking that I found life, but I didn't.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:20.580]   And his entire goal is for you to make those things
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:21.900]   that really aren't important,
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.060]   make those things really, really important in your life.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.940]   And those things that are really, really important,
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.020]   to make those things seem not very important.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:30.980]   That's his game plan.
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.940]   He's switching price tags tonight.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.940]   The things of infinite value, the things of eternal worth,
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.420]   he tries to make them worthless in your eyes.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.220]   And the things of Dallas, he tries to make those things
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:45.180]   appeal to your heart so that you would invest your time,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:49.140]   your talents, and your treasures in those things.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.380]   God is building a kingdom.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.740]   And he's inviting us to play a part of the kingdom.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.580]   And he's gonna feature this work for all of eternity.
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.660]   But you must stay in a relationship with Christ.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.340]   You must know him.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.420]   You can do that through getting in his word.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.780]   You can do that through community.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.460]   What we call here is small groups of men and women
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.180]   that have changed their playground and their playmates,
[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.180]   and they're all in.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.720]   You can do that through serving.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.220]   You can leave this place and go up to next first,
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.920]   not next steps, first steps.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.220]   And listen, you've been making excuses week in and week out,
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.100]   saying, "I'm not going there."
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.260]   You can come right here in front of the stage.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.900]   I'll stay up here as long as you want.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.700]   And we can talk.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.480]   But he's using people just like you
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.740]   to change the world.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.120]   But some of us are saying to God,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.300]   "Hey God, thanks for making me,
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.500]   "but I'll live life the way I wanna do it."
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.300]   And let me tell you, if you live for the world,
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.300]   we will die without ever doing what we were created to do.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.380]   And we will forfeit an opportunity
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.540]   to be a part of the eternal kingdom.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.040]   And some of us, man, we're living that right now.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.220]   You think all you are is an account manager.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.500]   All you are is a barista.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.180]   All you are is a marketing person.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.340]   All you are is a nurse.
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.340]   All you are, all you are is a teacher.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.460]   And God's saying, "No, that's not all you are.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.780]   "I created you to build a kingdom in a foreign land
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.380]   "and I've put you on mission
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.500]   "and you have the opportunity tonight
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.600]   "to not get so caught up in the world
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.660]   "and forsake that mission,
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.680]   "but you have an opportunity
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.200]   "to do what I've called you to do."
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.100]   And listen, everyone you share Christ with,
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.960]   you know what's gonna happen?
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.460]   You're gonna see them in eternity
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.540]   and they're gonna be thankful.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.880]   And everyone you share Christ with
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.780]   that's not in heaven,
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.740]   they're gonna be thankful that you did.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.680]   So what are you living for tonight?
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.940]   What's your purpose?
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.300]   Why are you created?
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.100]   Do you know Jesus?
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.740]   Are you living to make him known?
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:55.220]   Paul, his mantra,
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.940]   the first chapter of the book of Philippians
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.020]   that we study tonight,
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.740]   the crux of the entire message is this.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.160]   He says it in verse 21 of Philippians 1.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.880]   It's a coffee cup verse.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.020]   People get it tattooed on their body.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.200]   Man, you see it on T-shirts.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.480]   But this is what Paul says.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.400]   To live is Christ
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.280]   and to die is gain.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.520]   You know what he's saying there?
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.360]   You know what he's saying?
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.480]   He's saying, hey, if Christ is your purpose,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.860]   then death is your promotion.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.360]   Like when did we think that heaven wasn't enough?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.680]   Like when did we think that,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.640]   man, I think some of us, man,
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.840]   we think that heaven is just kind of this ethereal,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.540]   this just kind of in the sky somewhere,
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:35.940]   but the Bible's very clear.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.240]   It's a new heavens and a new earth.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.980]   Can you imagine a place without any pain,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:41.920]   without any heartbreak?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   Like study the Garden of Eden
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.120]   before sin entered the world.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.280]   It was a perfect place.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.800]   It was a material place.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.720]   Can you imagine a place without murder,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.160]   a place without strife,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.000]   a place without anxiety and fear?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   That's what our hearts long for.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.000]   And God's saying, hey,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.600]   there's gonna be a new heavens and a new earth
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.320]   that I'm gonna usher in.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.800]   And the former things have passed away.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.240]   And God says, hey, I'm gonna make all things new
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.680]   and it's gonna be a place of perfection
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.200]   forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.640]   And as we close,
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:26.080]   I want you to think of your life like this ladder,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.280]   this ladder.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.240]   Like if this ladder represents your life,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.600]   then the rungs on this ladder,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.000]   the steps on this ladder,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.560]   it represents the decades of your life.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.160]   And you know what's tragic
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.440]   is when you meet someone in their 70s or 80s,
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.840]   I talk to them all the time,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.120]   and they climb the ladder of success
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.060]   and the ladder of relationships
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.160]   and the ladder of health,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.120]   and they get to the top of that ladder
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.560]   only to realize, man, those things were important,
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.680]   but they just weren't ultimate.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.760]   Like they missed their purpose in those things.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.820]   And so some of us tonight,
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.040]   like we come into this place
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.240]   and we're in our 20s
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.360]   and we're like, man, I graduated from college
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.200]   and man, I'm gonna go to grad school
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.640]   and then man, I'm gonna land that job.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.560]   You know, that job that's gonna pay me six figures.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.400]   Like I'm gonna make it,
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.000]   I'm gonna get that corner office.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.880]   Like I'm gonna get that promotion
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.240]   and you're in your 20s
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.120]   or you're nearing the end of your 20s
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.480]   and you're still single,
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.480]   like you're still single
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.340]   and the shot clock of getting married,
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.200]   you feel like it's ticking.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.560]   And so you get into your 30s,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.960]   you go from your 20s to your 30s,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.480]   you're like, man, my important endeavor,
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.240]   the most important thing is that I find a spouse,
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.120]   that I find somebody.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.280]   And I mean, listen, you kind of did this thing
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.080]   your entire life, it was relationships,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.760]   like you pursued popularity
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.700]   and then you got to college
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.720]   and you did the whole Greek life,
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.440]   that sorority and that fraternity.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.880]   And now that you're single, it's like, man,
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.320]   I'm gonna pursue relationships,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.360]   that's what's gonna happen.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.240]   Then not only that, you're in your 20s
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.160]   or end of your 20s and your 30s
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.360]   and you're like, I'm gonna pursue a woman
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.960]   or I'm gonna pursue a guy
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.140]   so that I can get that family.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.320]   So in my 30s, like I started having kids
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.160]   and I want that perfect family,
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.040]   the one that the kids are matching
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.320]   and you take pictures
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.800]   and everyone's kind of is envious
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.320]   and jealous of your kids.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.720]   And then you get to like, I don't know,
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.560]   end of your 30s and you're like,
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.040]   man, I'm gonna start that company,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.760]   that company that you always wanted to start
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.320]   and you're like, this is my, man,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.720]   this is the decade y'all.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.960]   Like I'm gonna land that company,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.760]   like it's gonna happen.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.240]   Like, yeah, I'm getting it off the ground,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.320]   hell and high water, it's gonna happen.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.040]   Come on.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:45.880]   And you're like, man,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.760]   I got to pursue health in the middle of all this
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.080]   and so I'm gonna do that CrossFit,
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.800]   I'm gonna do that cycle bar,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.960]   I'm gonna eat kale and spinach and those shakes,
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.160]   but not the ones that have sugar in it,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.760]   like I'm going all out, come on.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.880]   And you just start pursuing all these different things
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.480]   and you get to the top of the ladder,
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.120]   you get to the top of the life
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.520]   and you made it, man.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.920]   Like you landed the company.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.240]   Like you got it off the ground,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.880]   it's successful, it's making money.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.040]   Like you got the spouse.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.280]   Like you got the wife,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.760]   you got the husband,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.120]   you got the kids that you always wanted
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.120]   and so you're at the top of this ladder.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.640]   I'm sorry, I'm making you nervous.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.360]   But listen, you're at the top of the ladder right here
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.840]   and you look down at the ladder,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.480]   you look down at all the successes
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.680]   and the relationships that you pursued
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.000]   and your health that you pursued
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.360]   and listen, man, those things aren't bad in themselves.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.200]   They're actually really good things.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.880]   But for some reason, you made them God things.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.120]   Like they became an idol in your life
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.480]   and you missed out on the one purpose that God said,
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.640]   hey, as you pursue these other things,
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.480]   would you know me and would you make me known?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.640]   And so you look down and you're like,
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.760]   man, I haven't known Christ any more than I did
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.120]   when I walked the aisle and I said the sinner's prayer
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.680]   and that thing that happened at church camp, right?
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:17.120]   I surely ain't making them known in these endeavors.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.960]   And so you get down from the ladder of your life
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.840]   and you just begin to replay the tape
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.960]   and you thought the things that you were pursuing
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.920]   were gonna give you the purpose,
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.160]   but they don't.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:44.120]   And listen, you look down at the ladder
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.200]   and you see a life that,
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.160]   sure, man, you accomplished some things,
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.280]   but it's a life that's quite frankly wasted.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.960]   And here's what I've learned to be true.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.720]   As I've sought to know Christ with my life
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.640]   and to make him known,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.880]   continue to have faithfulness over the rungs of the ladder
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.360]   that represents the decades of my life,
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.840]   then one day I'm gonna get to the top of that ladder,
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   the top of my life, and I'm gonna realize,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.040]   like, man, I pursued these things,
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.640]   but I had Christ in its proper place
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.480]   and he began to give meaning and purpose to my life.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.280]   He began to give meaning and purpose in all these things
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.640]   and God used my time, God used my achievements,
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.560]   God used my relationships, God used even my health
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.720]   to know him and to make him known.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.440]   And some of you, the tragedy is this,
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.880]   you don't believe me.
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.080]   You're like, man, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna prove you wrong.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   Well, here's what I want you to do, man.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.020]   When you get to 50 or 60, I want you to call me.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.960]   Like, I want you to email me.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.480]   Because I don't think you're gonna,
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.160]   I don't think you're right.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.040]   Like, I've talked to the 50-year-olds,
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.640]   I've talked to 60s, I've talked to 70s,
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.080]   I've talked to people on their deathbed.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.160]   I promise that whatever you're doing,
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   CEO or working at a coffee shop,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.020]   if you pair them with the ultimate thing,
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.760]   which is knowing Jesus and making him known,
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.220]   listen, if you don't believe me,
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.600]   then come find the names that I read earlier.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.840]   If you think your purpose is found in beauty,
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.680]   come find Leslie.
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.960]   If you think your purpose is found in corporate America,
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   come find Kat.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.760]   If you think your purpose is found in sports
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.400]   and making money, come find Kyle.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.100]   If you think your purpose is found in, listen, listen,
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.480]   climbing this or climbing that,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.540]   control and power or sexuality, come find my buddy Joe.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:42.860]   We wanna talk to you.
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.880]   Like, some of you tonight,
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.980]   like, you're gonna walk out of this place.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.540]   And you have the chance
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:55.060]   to live and learn,
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:41:00.220]   which that's where life gives you a whooping.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:05.380]   Or you have the chance to learn and then live.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.260]   Not because of what I said tonight,
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:13.620]   but because of what the words from the past
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.780]   that tell about your future.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.500]   So if your life is a ladder and every rung is a decade,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.780]   how are you gonna spend your life?
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.460]   Like, we're wrapping up this series tonight,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.580]   fortune telling.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.860]   And if you will spend your future knowing Jesus
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.980]   and making him known,
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.780]   then watch what he will do with your obedience.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.100]   I promise you, man,
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.700]   no one's ever got to the end of their life
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.780]   and pursued those two things and regretted it.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.180]   It's never happened and it's never will.
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.700]   And it never will.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.400]   Let me pray that it would tonight.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.440]   (congregation murmurs)
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.920]   Father God, let me pray
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.280]   that you would arrest our hearts,
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.480]   that you would remind me in this moment
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.440]   that if this message wasn't for anyone else,
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.440]   God, it's for me.
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.600]   I needed it.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.580]   God, that you would have your way.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.400]   God, that you would do a work that only you can do.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.420]   That you would help us to realize
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:22.340]   that in the midst of all the endeavors that we could pursue,
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.780]   help us to remember that you're the inventor
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.720]   of all those endeavors.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.060]   And when we put you in your proper place
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.460]   to make you known and to know you,
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.820]   we will live a life of purpose.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.980]   And so whatever we find ourself doing tonight,
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.620]   whether we're a janitor, whether we own a business,
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.020]   whether we're flipping burgers,
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:51.520]   or we're a doctor, a lawyer,
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.480]   whatever prestigious occupation
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.220]   that's in your mind right now, God,
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.620]   would you have your way in our hearts
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.100]   and would you put our lives on a path of purpose
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.980]   for your glory, our joy, and the world's good.
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.020]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
