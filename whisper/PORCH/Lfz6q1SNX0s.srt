1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:22,900
 - I love it.

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,720
 Well, that's right.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,920
 We are continuing our series Bad Advice tonight.

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,880
 Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,640
 and in Houston and in Spring and El Paso and Tulsa

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,100
 and tuning in wherever you are.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,760
 Has anyone ever heard of the term a sneezer before?

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,640
 It's a business term and here's what I know.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,720
 You may not know what that word means,

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,660
 but you know someone who is a sneezer.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,500
 I'll tell you what a sneezer is.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,880
 A sneezer is someone who spreads ideas or experiences

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,020
 or things that they really like,

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,280
 like a virus or a contagion.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,400
 Like they're the kind of person,

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,080
 everyone knows a guy who's a sneezer.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,720
 Everyone knows a girl or a guy who's a sneezer.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,560
 They're the kind of person who,

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,160
 when they experience something they really like,

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,520
 they gotta tell everybody in the world about it.

22
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
 Like, hey, I have this toothpaste.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,120
 I don't care what toothpaste you're using.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,360
 This is the greatest toothpaste of all time.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,800
 You gotta change this toothpaste.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,400
 They're the kind of person that spreads this restaurant.

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,240
 You gotta try it.

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,880
 They have the best appetizer you've ever ate before.

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,760
 You gotta go to this person.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,520
 They seem to always have a guy for something.

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,180
 They're like, oh man, you're looking for a mechanic?

32
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,020
 Look, I got somebody.

33
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,040
 I can take care of you.

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,280
 There's the best mechanic in the entire DFW area,

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,720
 tri-state, you gotta go see him.

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,700
 He's the best.

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,880
 See his reviews on Yelp.

38
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
 They're the person who knows everything

39
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,720
 or they seem to have a strong opinion

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,560
 on just about everything that it seems like.

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
 They're really common.

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,360
 Everybody, anybody know someone who's like this?

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,040
 Like, they just kinda like, they gotta tell you

44
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,040
 about the different experiences that they've had

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,900
 or this new restaurant or this new hotel

46
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,720
 or whatever thing that they've done.

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,080
 Here's why I appreciate sneezers,

48
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 because I am totally a sneezer.

49
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,360
 For whatever reason, it's like hard for me to not share.

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,160
 Like, when I, I'm totally the guy who's like,

51
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
 dude, I have the best dentist.

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,920
 I don't care who your dentist, oh, it's your dad?

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,520
 Hey, look, this guy's better than your dad.

54
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,680
 And whatever it is, it's just easy.

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,520
 It overflows.

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,800
 Like, when I went on my honeymoon,

57
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,760
 we went to this amazing hotel

58
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,880
 or this amazing resort in Mexico, came back from it.

59
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,000
 And of course, I was like, man,

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I gotta tell everybody in the world.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,200
 I work with young adults who are getting married

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,640
 all the time, and there is one option in the world

63
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,980
 for you people that I need to make sure

64
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,900
 that everybody knows about, the greatest thing

65
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,080
 that you're ever gonna experience in terms of a honeymoon.

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
 It's just easy.

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,240
 It kinda overflows and pours out.

68
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,200
 And if you're a sneezer in the room,

69
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,080
 you know what I'm talking about.

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,200
 It's just part of your personality.

71
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 Now, as easy as it is to talk about virtually anything,

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
 there's one category that, for me,

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
 it's not as easy to bring up,

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,100
 and it's not as easy to talk about, faith.

75
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,520
 I mean, despite the fact that, yeah,

76
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,560
 I'm a pastor, secret's out, when I'm outside engaging

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,360
 with people or talking to neighbors or different things,

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,160
 that unlike other arenas or other conversation starters

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
 or other topics, for me, when it comes to talking

80
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,560
 about faith, there's just something

81
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,680
 where it's a little bit more sensitive

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,720
 of a subject, a little bit more delicate.

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,120
 It's a little harder for me to move into that conversation.

84
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,480
 In other words, I'm not, there's natural evangelists

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,600
 out there, for me, sharing my faith is more

86
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,120
 like a discipline, it's something I have

87
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,300
 to be intentional about and mindful about.

88
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,200
 There's natural evangelists like JP,

89
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,080
 who every time I'm around him at a meal or dinner

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,840
 or any place that he goes, he's always sharing his faith.

91
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,800
 He's the guy that shares it literally with everybody.

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,200
 You'll bump into a coffee machine.

93
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,440
 Coffee machine, trust Christ.

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,400
 He's the guy who shares it with anybody and everybody.

95
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
 And for me, that's just not my story.

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,880
 I have to be more intentional and more to work at it.

97
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,000
 And here's why.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,640
 'Cause unlike when you're talking about a dentist

99
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,760
 or about your favorite place to shop for clothes

100
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,880
 or store the best deal or this website

101
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,560
 that you gotta check out, unlike all those different things

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,060
 where you could talk about, when it comes

103
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,020
 to the topic of faith, those other things are not offensive.

104
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,760
 But there's something when you bring up the idea

105
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,480
 of Jesus or faith, religion, where all of a sudden,

106
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,120
 there's just a heightened sensitivity

107
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,800
 that everybody else feels, where people can get offended

108
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,360
 or we're afraid we're going to offend someone

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,280
 in a way that those other topics typically don't.

110
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
 And here's why.

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,840
 Because of the bad advice we're gonna talk about tonight.

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
 That we live in a world who has been saturated

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,120
 or we as Americans live in a culture that's been saturated

114
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,040
 with the bad advice tonight, which is don't impose

115
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
 your beliefs on people.

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,200
 That you and I, you can't impose your beliefs on people.

117
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,520
 You shouldn't impose your beliefs on people.

118
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,360
 You shouldn't impose your faith or religion on people.

119
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,440
 And tonight, we're gonna explore

120
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,320
 why that is such bad advice.

121
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,680
 Not only from the verses that we're gonna see,

122
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,560
 but for those of us who are Christians in the room,

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
 it's bad advice just from the words of Jesus,

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,400
 who says, man, to not impose your beliefs,

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,280
 don't hide behind the lie of that bad advice.

126
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,880
 You are the light of the world.

127
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
 You are the light of your apartment complex,

128
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
 your workplace, the cubicle.

129
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,080
 You are the light of your family, if you're a believer,

130
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,900
 if you're a Christian.

131
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,160
 Tonight, we're gonna talk about Christians

132
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,040
 and explore why it is such bad advice, if you buy the lie,

133
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,200
 that you should not impose your beliefs

134
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
 on the world around you, on those who live near you,

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
 those who work by you.

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,400
 Specifically, we're gonna see from the Apostle Paul

137
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,120
 why that's such bad advice and how we share our faith

138
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
 or what is the method by which we share our faith.

139
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,000
 We're gonna be in Acts chapter 17,

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,980
 where Paul lays out as clear as any other place

141
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,280
 through his own life and his example,

142
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,880
 his motivation for sharing his faith,

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
 the method that he uses to share his faith,

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
 and the mixed reactions that always happen

145
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
 anytime you share faith, 'cause this is further what I know.

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
 80%, a recent poll came out and said,

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
 80% of people who are Christians,

148
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,480
 so if you're a Christian, talking to you in the room,

149
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,400
 say, "Hey, man, I trust you."

150
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,360
 80% of Christians say, "Man, I have a personal responsibility

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,480
 "before God to share my faith."

152
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,620
 And the same poll found that the vast majority of those

153
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,420
 has said that, "Not only do I believe I'm supposed to,

154
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,520
 "but I haven't any time in recent history.

155
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,840
 "Within the last six to 12 months,

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,580
 "I have not shared with anybody."

157
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,720
 So there's some great divide that exists for many of us,

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,440
 and that was in America, in a USA poll,

159
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,540
 as it relates to the Christian church

160
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,040
 that they believe I should share, I just don't.

161
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,400
 And tonight, we're gonna look at why that's such a tragedy

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,320
 and how we can overcome it.

163
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
 We're gonna be in Acts chapter 17.

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,520
 If you have a Bible foot there, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts.

165
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,600
 And let me set the scene.

166
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
 Acts is essentially the story of the early church.

167
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
 So Jesus leaves, and the book of Acts

168
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,920
 is all about the apostles in kind of the early church days.

169
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,740
 And it's the apostle Paul,

170
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,200
 who was the artist formerly known as Saul,

171
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,580
 who spent the first half of his life

172
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,960
 trying to kill Christianity, stop Christianity,

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,440
 meets Jesus, and spends the next half of his life

174
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
 trying to spread Christianity.

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,840
 Here's what's going on in Acts chapter 17.

176
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,000
 Paul has been hanging out,

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,240
 he's been spreading the message of Jesus

178
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
 all over the place, all over the ancient world.

179
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
 He's in Athens, he's waiting for a couple friends.

180
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,640
 He's hanging out in the city of Athens.

181
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,860
 And that's where our story's gonna pick up.

182
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,980
 Here's all you gotta know about Athens.

183
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,000
 Athens was like the cultural hub of the day.

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
 It was the religious hub of the ancient world.

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,200
 It was a port city, it was a city of incredible influence.

186
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,360
 Olympics started there, Western philosophy started there,

187
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,480
 Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, all those guys

188
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,600
 that you heard about once in philosophy class years ago.

189
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,620
 All those guys were from the city of Athens.

190
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,880
 And Paul shows up, and what he sees inside of the city

191
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,760
 moves him to Acts.

192
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,360
 So here's where we're gonna pick up the story, verse 16.

193
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,320
 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens,

194
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 he was greatly distressed, so he's waiting for his friends,

195
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,960
 and he's greatly distressed to see the city

196
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,200
 was full of idols.

197
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,120
 And Paul looks around inside of the city of Athens,

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
 and all of a sudden, and the word distressed

199
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
 is like a heart-wrenching.

200
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,280
 But he looks around and sees idols everywhere.

201
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,300
 We know from other writings of the day

202
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,520
 that there were 25 to 30,000 idols inside of Athens.

203
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,480
 It is a common saying that it's easier to find a God

204
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
 than a man in Athens.

205
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 So Paul looks around everywhere,

206
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,080
 he looks and sees these different gods or false idols

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,480
 to these different things that they worshiped,

208
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
 and here's what happens.

209
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,320
 So this distressing moves him, and he does something.

210
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,640
 So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews

211
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,000
 and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace,

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
 day by day with those who happened to be there.

213
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,480
 So Paul moves to Act.

214
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,360
 This distressing moves him to begin having

215
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,240
 these different conversations with people.

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,080
 And he begins reasoning with them about their faith

217
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
 and about what he believes in Jesus.

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
 And all of a sudden, this debate happens.

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,600
 A group of Epicureans, which is like a class of people,

220
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,960
 be like the Republicans or Democrats,

221
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
 or it's kind of a group that's known,

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,920
 identified with this belief.

223
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
 Epicureans, here's all you need to know about them.

224
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,520
 There are people who believed there is no afterlife.

225
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,720
 They essentially, they and Drake would get along,

226
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,200
 live by the motto, YOLO, eat, drink, and be merry,

227
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
 'cause tomorrow we die.

228
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,080
 So Epicureans are there, and Stoics,

229
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
 who essentially live by CrossFit,

230
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,440
 that life is about discipline.

231
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,920
 They begin to debate with Paul, and some of them asked,

232
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,840
 "What is this babbler trying to say?"

233
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,200
 And others remarked,

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
 "He seems to be advocating foreign gods."

235
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
 They said this because Paul was preaching the good news

236
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,560
 about Jesus and the resurrection.

237
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,760
 That Paul shows up, and he sees this city full of idols,

238
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,920
 and he sees everywhere that he looks,

239
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
 these different gods that they're worshiping.

240
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,240
 And all of a sudden, because he knows the one true God,

241
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,840
 he's moved not to begin to go picket Athens

242
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,680
 and be like, "We're gonna boycott this city,"

243
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,580
 and he's not Snapchatting,

244
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,200
 "Can you believe these crazy people?"

245
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,960
 He's moved to begin to share his faith

246
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,520
 with those in the marketplace.

247
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,440
 He begins to reach out and talk about Jesus

248
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,600
 and the resurrection.

249
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,680
 Why would Paul feel like he has the right

250
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
 to share with these people?

251
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,160
 Because Paul knew, and Paul was driven by a motivation,

252
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,800
 that it is not loving to know the truth about Jesus,

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,280
 to know the truth about eternal life,

254
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,300
 and to not share it with people.

255
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,000
 That Paul was driven, or his motivation,

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,100
 just like our motivation, is that of compassion.

257
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,920
 The reason why Paul looks around at a city

258
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,000
 that's full of idol worship,

259
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,240
 that has all kinds of different gods

260
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,260
 that they're worshiping, and then go,

261
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,040
 "Ah, yeah, teach his own, it'll be okay."

262
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,200
 The reason why he doesn't do that

263
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,640
 is because he's moved with compassion,

264
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,000
 that I know the one true God,

265
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
 and it would be unloving for me to sit here silent

266
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,120
 and to not share my faith.

267
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,480
 Paul, our first idea from the text,

268
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,800
 his motivation, just like ours, is compassion.

269
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,040
 The motivation that believers have,

270
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,800
 if you and I are ever gonna move to share faith,

271
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,000
 or the motivation that should move us to share faith,

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,120
 is that of compassion, that like Eminem said,

273
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,080
 there's a place called heaven and a place called hell,

274
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,520
 and everyone will spend eternity

275
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,920
 at one of those two places.

276
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,260
 That everyone lives forever somewhere.

277
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,520
 That every person, red, yellow, black, and white,

278
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,000
 every person you've ever interacted with,

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,620
 the person who bags your groceries,

280
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,680
 the person in the apartment complex above you,

281
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,780
 the person that sits next to you at work,

282
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,920
 every person in your family, immediate and extended,

283
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,280
 everyone you've ever been eyeball to eyeball with

284
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,100
 is someone who will spend and live eternally,

285
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,760
 either in heaven or in hell, and this moves Paul,

286
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
 'cause he knows the only way that a person

287
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,660
 can have eternal life and experience eternal life in heaven

288
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,180
 is by trusting what Jesus did on the cross,

289
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,240
 in his death and resurrection.

290
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,480
 That's not by being a good person.

291
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
 Paul knows the only way that a person

292
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,320
 can live eternally in heaven and not eternally in hell

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,520
 is by trusting what Jesus did on the cross.

294
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,080
 It would be so unloving for me to keep my mouth shut,

295
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,940
 and it moves Paul to begin to open up his mouth and talk.

296
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,520
 I mean, what greater motivation

297
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,600
 could a group or an organization have

298
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
 for their mission than the church?

299
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,400
 Than the fact that, like, man, every person

300
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,880
 that you've ever interacted with is someone

301
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,160
 who not only Jesus died for,

302
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,280
 but that will live forever with God

303
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,500
 or forever apart from him.

304
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,400
 What greater motivation,

305
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,800
 like a lot of groups have different motivations.

306
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,440
 Like if you're a teacher, you have a motivation,

307
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,160
 like, hey, get these kids educated so I can pay my bills.

308
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,760
 If you're a person who is in sales,

309
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,360
 you're like, man, I'm motivated to get more money.

310
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,920
 Or maybe you're in construction,

311
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,240
 you're motivated to complete a job.

312
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,760
 The Apostle Paul shows us the greatest motivation

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,680
 is that of the one that everyone lives forever somewhere.

314
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,080
 And so how can I not share?

315
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,160
 I was in Africa a number of years ago,

316
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,000
 and I spent essentially a summer in Africa.

317
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,920
 And while we were there,

318
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,040
 we were in this like East Ugandan village.

319
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,860
 It was super remote.

320
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,660
 Like we are no electricity, no water in this village

321
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,460
 doing some kind of orphanage stuff.

322
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,400
 And like, I mean, deep, we're in the bush.

323
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,240
 You know where the bush is?

324
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,060
 We're there.

325
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,580
 And so we're super remote,

326
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,620
 and we're hanging out with the villages,

327
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,760
 and we're there for about a month.

328
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,340
 And while we're there, one of the villagers said,

329
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,740
 hey, I wanna have you guys come over

330
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,740
 and essentially have something to eat and drink with us.

331
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,660
 We go into this guy's house, get there,

332
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,460
 walk in the door, he hands me an ice cold Coke, Coca-Cola.

333
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,620
 And I'm like, dude, how could this possibly

334
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,460
 be here right now?

335
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,020
 Like it is a cold Coke.

336
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,060
 There's no refrigerators anywhere around here.

337
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,640
 What sort of magic trick has this man played?

338
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,100
 Where could this possibly have come from?

339
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,940
 Here's how it got there.

340
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,180
 The guy had boughten or bought it, boughten,

341
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,900
 it from a, (laughs)

342
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,020
 I need you educators.

343
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,820
 You guys didn't do your job, teachers.

344
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,700
 (audience laughs)

345
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,540
 The guy had bought it.

346
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,020
 There was someone in the village who every single day

347
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,140
 would sell these Coca-Colas.

348
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,300
 How did he get the Coca-Colas

349
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
 to begin to sell to the villagers?

350
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,580
 He would go on his bike and he would ride his bike

351
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,500
 and he would meet with a cooler.

352
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,220
 He would go pick up at this truck that would show up

353
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
 and go around to these different remote villages

354
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,740
 and he would hand off Coca-Cola.

355
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,580
 The guy would take the Coca-Cola on his bike.

356
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,640
 He would go around, he would sell.

357
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,060
 That's how he made a living.

358
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,340
 Now, so that's how we got the Coca-Cola there.

359
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,540
 Now let me ask you this.

360
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:20,700
 What motivated Coca-Cola to get the product

361
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,460
 into the hands of East remote, random people

362
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,300
 all over the planet?

363
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,740
 People who will never even experience electricity

364
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,020
 but they have Coca-Cola.

365
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,700
 What could have possibly led to the sequence of events

366
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,940
 that ended up with Coca-Cola being in this village?

367
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,540
 Here's what I mean.

368
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,220
 Was it the fact that somewhere some guy who made Coca-Cola

369
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,900
 was like, "This is an incredible product.

370
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,460
 "It's life-changing.

371
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,740
 "The nutritional value here is incredible.

372
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,200
 "We gotta get it in the hands of every African out there,

373
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,340
 "every person on the planet.

374
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
 "We gotta get it there."

375
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,420
 No, it's not the right Coke.

376
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,360
 It's like, "We gotta get it everywhere

377
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
 "'cause it's a great product."

378
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,900
 It's terrible for you nutritionally.

379
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,100
 And you could leave a nail in there for a few days

380
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,940
 and it'll disintegrate.

381
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,420
 That can't be good, whatever that means.

382
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,700
 So it's not because of that reason.

383
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,300
 It's for one reason and one reason only, which is what?

384
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,860
 Money.

385
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,780
 That in some C-suite somewhere, there's some CEO

386
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,540
 in some high-rise on the eighth floor going,

387
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,540
 "We gotta get Coca-Cola in more places

388
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,360
 "and more spaces into the hands of more people

389
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
 "all over the planet.

390
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
 "We're gonna fill the Great Commission of Coca-Cola.

391
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,460
 "Every country in the entire world will have Coca-Cola."

392
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,300
 Why?

393
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
 For one reason, money.

394
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,100
 Little pieces of green paper with dead presidents on it.

395
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,180
 And this thing drives, and Coca-Cola, man,

396
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,700
 they have fulfilled almost their Great Commission.

397
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,140
 It's on every country on the planet

398
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,140
 except for Saudi Arabia and North Korea.

399
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,220
 All because of one motivation, money.

400
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,220
 How much greater is the Christian message?

401
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,980
 And Paul looks in the eyes of these Athenians,

402
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,500
 and the reason he's even in Athens

403
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,460
 is because he believes there is a God who's out there.

404
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,860
 Every person that I'm surrounded by

405
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,380
 will live eternally somewhere,

406
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,140
 either in heaven with the God who created them,

407
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,660
 love them, die for them on a cross,

408
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,980
 or eternally apart from him.

409
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,060
 And he is reaching out through the body of Christ,

410
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,380
 and I am moved with compassion.

411
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,820
 It's unloving for you to stay silent

412
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,620
 while those around you wonder about the God who's out there.

413
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,900
 It's unloving to keep your mouth shut.

414
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,980
 And we live in a world that's like,

415
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,100
 man, it's so judgmental,

416
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,260
 and it's not loving for you to talk about your faith.

417
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,140
 Paul would say the opposite is true.

418
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,060
 And man, when I read the story of Paul,

419
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,300
 it's so convicting,

420
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,080
 because man, this was so real for him.

421
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,740
 He believed it, and it impacted him at such a core level.

422
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,020
 His motivation, it drove him all over the ancient world,

423
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,020
 sharing his faith, unique, even among the disciples.

424
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,700
 All the apostles, even when you look at ancient history,

425
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,860
 you study the church, there's something about Paul.

426
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,260
 He stands out, even different from Peter, James, and John.

427
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,820
 When you read the story, you read the book of Acts,

428
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,380
 you can see the first few decades of the church,

429
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,900
 and you see just the places that these different guys went.

430
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,580
 You see where Peter, James, and John,

431
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,180
 and where they took the mission.

432
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,900
 All of them, for the first couple decades,

433
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,980
 pretty much for the most part, just hang out in Jerusalem,

434
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,420
 versus Paul, who goes all over the place,

435
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,400
 taking the message everywhere that he goes,

436
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,300
 all over the ancient world and Europe.

437
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,740
 Almost as though there was some meeting that took place

438
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,780
 with all the apostles together that we missed,

439
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,180
 where they got together, all 12 in a room.

440
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,380
 Paul's standing there, he puts up a big map on the wall,

441
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,300
 and he's like, all right, you guys got the whole world here.

442
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,760
 You guys take Jerusalem, I'll take everything else.

443
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,540
 (congregation laughing)

444
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,780
 Good?

445
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,180
 Like there was something where Paul just,

446
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,500
 it grabbed hold of him.

447
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,340
 And while everyone else kinda hung around

448
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,100
 for the first couple decades, instead of Jerusalem,

449
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,620
 Paul went everywhere, saying this is for every person,

450
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,340
 because every person lives forever somewhere,

451
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,960
 and I have a motivation of compassion

452
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,420
 that they would know the risen Christ

453
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,140
 and the resurrection and Jesus.

454
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,180
 So Paul shares this, and this creates kind of a stir

455
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,420
 in Athens, and so they take him before

456
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,940
 the elite of elite group.

457
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,420
 They begin to say, man, all right,

458
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,540
 hey, we've heard your message,

459
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,700
 we wanna make sure that they hear it.

460
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
 So here's what happens next, verse 19.

461
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,580
 Then they took him, and they brought him

462
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,420
 to the meeting of the Areopagus.

463
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,860
 Areopagus is a word that means the hill of Ares,

464
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,200
 or Mars Hill, you may have heard it called before.

465
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,820
 It's essentially this hill that these 30 men

466
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,140
 who made up kind of the Supreme Court of the day of Athens,

467
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,380
 these were the high-power individuals,

468
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,460
 and they're kinda over the city of Athens,

469
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,460
 and they decide what religions can be tolerated here

470
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,180
 and what's gonna happen and what can take place,

471
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,980
 and there's these 30 men who are the governing body.

472
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,660
 So Paul comes before them.

473
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,420
 Interestingly enough, this is the group that Socrates,

474
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,780
 if you know who that guy is, Socrates went before,

475
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,380
 and for proclaiming foreign deities,

476
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,140
 Socrates was sentenced to death.

477
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,200
 So Paul goes before these guys, and he's standing

478
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,160
 in what very likely could be a group

479
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,320
 that wants to have him killed,

480
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
 wants to have something happen,

481
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,120
 and he doesn't shy away at all,

482
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,920
 'cause Paul is straight thug life,

483
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,640
 and he goes right into sharing the gospel.

484
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 Here's what happens.

485
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,000
 He brought them before the Areopagus, and they say,

486
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,420
 "We want to know these new teachings

487
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,480
 "that you are presenting.

488
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,900
 "You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears,

489
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,040
 "and we would like to know what they mean."

490
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,540
 All the Athenians and the foreigners who live there

491
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,400
 spent their time doing nothing but talking about

492
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,720
 and listening to the latest ideas.

493
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
 So they said, basically, "Hey, we want to hear

494
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,780
 "what you're bringing, what you're talking about,

495
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,640
 "and these foreign ideas."

496
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,320
 So then Paul launches into his TED Talk, if you will,

497
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,440
 and takes the opportunity to share about his faith.

498
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,280
 Here's what happens.

499
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,320
 He stands up at the meeting in the Areopagus and said,

500
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,660
 "People of Athens, I see that in every way

501
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,860
 "you are very religious.

502
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,960
 "For as I walked around and looked carefully

503
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,080
 "at your objects of worship,

504
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,860
 "I even found an altar with this inscription.

505
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,080
 "To an unknown God."

506
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,800
 The unknown God, so basically what Paul just said is,

507
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
 "Hey, I walked around the whole city.

508
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,000
 "You got a sun god, a moon god, a stars god,

509
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,100
 "you got a sewage god, you got every kind of god out there,

510
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,080
 "and then you have this one inscription that says,"

511
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
 true story, they have a sewage god,

512
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,820
 "and they have this one inscription that says,

513
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,020
 "To an unknown God."

514
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,680
 And Paul realizes what, of course, you would see

515
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
 is that they had this uncertainty that, man,

516
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,360
 we have all these different gods, but maybe we missed one.

517
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,240
 Maybe we missed one.

518
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,560
 In case, like, there's some god we forgot to honor

519
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,940
 or worship, and maybe he's gonna show up someday

520
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,960
 and be like, "Hey, I'm Bob.

521
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,800
 "Hey, where's my idol?

522
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,640
 "Where's the statue?

523
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,460
 "There's nothing."

524
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,300
 And they're gonna go, "Oh, Bob, you're here.

525
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,240
 "We just didn't know your name.

526
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,280
 "This idol to the unknown God, this is for you.

527
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,780
 "This is you, we knew you were there.

528
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,000
 "We just didn't know your name."

529
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,080
 And Paul recognizes that you guys have all

530
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,920
 of these different expressions of worship,

531
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,900
 but you don't have any certainty.

532
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,360
 You admit at the end of the day,

533
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,000
 idol to the unknown God, you're guessing.

534
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,760
 You don't know the gods that are there and not there,

535
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,400
 and so you kind of are covering your bases

536
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,260
 by having this one, and he says,

537
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,200
 "I know the name of the unknown God.

538
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
 "I know the God that is there."

539
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,560
 And he launches again into this topic.

540
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,140
 Continues, "So you are ignorant of the very thing

541
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,560
 "that you worship, which I'm gonna proclaim to you.

542
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,940
 "The God who made the world and everything in it

543
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,800
 "is Lord of heaven and earth."

544
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,680
 So the God who is there, there's not a lot of gods.

545
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
 There's one God.

546
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,200
 And he does not live in temples made by human hands.

547
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,020
 There's temples everywhere, and he's going,

548
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,720
 there's one God, and he doesn't live in that building

549
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,840
 or in that building.

550
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,840
 And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything.

551
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,680
 Rather, he himself gives everyone breath

552
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,020
 and everything else.

553
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,960
 "From one man, he made all the nations

554
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,280
 "that they should inhabit the whole earth,

555
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,360
 "and he marked out their appointed times and history

556
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,760
 "and the boundaries of their land."

557
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,280
 So not only is God great, God is intimately involved

558
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,400
 in the places and times in which humanity lives.

559
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,420
 Side note, God is intimately involved in where you live,

560
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,140
 the family you live in, the time in which you live.

561
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,380
 Like, it is not an accident that you live in 2017.

562
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,180
 You may be like, "No, my parents told me I'm an accident."

563
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,900
 You are not an accident to God

564
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
 that he knows everything about.

565
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,180
 He placed you exactly where you was,

566
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,260
 and he did it for a purpose.

567
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,980
 I love this verse.

568
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,900
 Why did God place people in the times

569
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,200
 and places where they are?

570
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,580
 God did this so that they would seek him

571
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,540
 and perhaps reach out for him and find him,

572
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,560
 though he's not far from any of us,

573
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,220
 that God placed people when and where he did

574
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,480
 so that in hopes that the place that they live

575
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,320
 and the time that they live,

576
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,680
 they would reach out and find God,

577
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,000
 and they would find, as Paul's about to tell us,

578
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,700
 that he's a God who's reaching back out towards them.

579
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,000
 And he quotes some of their own poets.

580
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,840
 I love this.

581
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,300
 For in him we live and move and have our being,

582
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,940
 as some of your own poets have said.

583
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,900
 We are his offspring.

584
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,940
 Therefore, since we are God's offspring,

585
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,300
 we should not think that the divine being

586
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,900
 is like gold or silver or stone

587
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,420
 or an image made by human design and skill.

588
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,700
 Like, in other words, hey, even your own poets,

589
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,840
 he quotes their own poetry, like Greek poets,

590
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,980
 people they would have known.

591
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,140
 He doesn't quote Deuteronomy.

592
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,660
 It'd be like quoting Jay-Z.

593
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,500
 It'd be like quoting Eminem,

594
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,680
 and that's exactly what it'd be like.

595
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,360
 He quotes these two Greek poets that would have known.

596
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,320
 He's like, look, even your own poets acknowledge

597
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,400
 the gods who are there are a whole lot bigger

598
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
 than these different little statues.

599
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,880
 In him we live and move and have our being.

600
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,320
 We're his offspring.

601
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,160
 If we're the offspring of God,

602
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,400
 we shouldn't think that we could create God.

603
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,800
 Even your own poets say that, hey, God created us.

604
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,200
 Therefore, we can't just make a little statue,

605
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,020
 and that's God.

606
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,280
 That's silly, and Paul just reasons with them

607
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,480
 and connects them or connects to them,

608
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,040
 and the beliefs and the things that they believe.

609
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,040
 He continues, in the past, God has overlooked such ignorance,

610
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,560
 but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.

611
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,200
 The word repent is a little Greek word for change your mind.

612
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,080
 There's different times throughout Scripture

613
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
 where depending on the context, it means, hey,

614
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,080
 turn from these actions that you're doing,

615
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,420
 and other times in Scripture where based on the context,

616
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,720
 it's just a word for, hey, change the way

617
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,120
 you're thinking about it.

618
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,680
 Paul, in this context, is not saying,

619
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,200
 hey, you need to correct your behavior.

620
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,640
 He's saying you need to change the way you think about God,

621
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,520
 that God commands all people everywhere,

622
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,480
 that there isn't Zeus and Mars or Ares

623
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 and all these different gods.

624
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,200
 There is one God who created the world

625
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 and formed everything in it, and he commands all people

626
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,720
 to change the way that they think about him,

627
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,880
 change the way that they think, many of them,

628
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,520
 who think that God is demanding something from him,

629
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,840
 that God who's there is not served by human hands,

630
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
 but he loves to serve, and he did so by coming

631
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,080
 in the form of Jesus and dying on a cross.

632
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,640
 Here's what he says, commands all people,

633
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,300
 for he has set a day he will judge the world with justice

634
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,080
 by the man, that's Jesus.

635
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,200
 He is appointed, and he has given proof of this

636
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
 by raising him from the dead,

637
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,360
 that Paul says God commands everyone everywhere

638
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,900
 to change the way that they think about the God

639
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,480
 who is there, who's not demanding something from them.

640
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
 He's not served by human hands,

641
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,560
 but he's done something for them,

642
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
 and he died and rose from the dead in their place.

643
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,120
 Paul lays out really in doing so,

644
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,720
 gives us a perfect model of the method

645
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
 by which we share our faith.

646
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,180
 So our motivation is compassion.

647
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,760
 That's why don't impose your beliefs is horrific advice.

648
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,280
 And the method by which we share our faith, Paul lays out.

649
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,100
 What's the method?

650
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,160
 Our method is that we connect and confront.

651
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,520
 The method by which we share our faith,

652
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,280
 just like Paul did, is you connect to those

653
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,700
 who you're talking with or sharing your faith with,

654
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,760
 speaking with, and then you confront them with Christ.

655
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,600
 You don't confront them with,

656
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,760
 "Why, man, you should change your sexual behavior.

657
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,400
 "You should stop smoking that."

658
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,300
 You confront them with Jesus.

659
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,300
 Jesus alone is enough of a stumbling block.

660
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,240
 You point them to Christ, and everything else will change,

661
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
 or everything hinges on that.

662
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,080
 You connect first, and then you confront.

663
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,840
 Paul's method is, hey, connect first, confront.

664
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
 How did Paul connect?

665
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,960
 Like, he starts out, like, think about this.

666
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,040
 He doesn't condemn their idol worship

667
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,960
 and be like, "What are you guys doing?

668
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,980
 "A sewage God?

669
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,200
 "That's pathetic."

670
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,960
 He looks at them and compliments them.

671
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
 "Hey, man, I see you guys are religious.

672
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 "Like, you're trying to figure this out.

673
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,240
 "And I also see there's an unknown God,

674
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,660
 "and he seeks to connect.

675
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,200
 "There's an arena you're not certain on."

676
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
 Not only does he do that, I mean,

677
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,160
 think about the fact that he even quotes

678
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,000
 from their own poetry.

679
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,840
 At some point, Paul cared enough about these Greek men

680
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,960
 and women to read their literature, study it,

681
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,160
 and use that as a springboard into a conversation

682
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,840
 that you seek first to connect and then move to Christ.

683
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,240
 The way that our method for sharing

684
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,160
 is we seek first to connect and then to confront.

685
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,000
 What does this look like for us?

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,720
 It just looks like asking questions

687
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,240
 in the midst of trying to share our faith.

688
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
 It's just like, man, hey, what's your name?

689
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,200
 Where are you from?

690
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,280
 How long have you worked here?

691
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,320
 What are you up to this weekend?

692
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,600
 Man, are you dating someone?

693
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,440
 How's that going?

694
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,260
 What's his name?

695
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,120
 And we just seek any way that we can connect

696
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,480
 with real life, caring for people,

697
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,240
 and use that as a springboard

698
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,680
 into a conversation about Jesus.

699
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,280
 I mean, there's just different ways, man,

700
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,120
 especially around here where it has been so healthy for me.

701
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,100
 I love this place 'cause if you hang around here long enough,

702
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,560
 you will learn different ways to jump into the conversation

703
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,040
 about sharing your faith,

704
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,880
 whether it's like allowing someone's name

705
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,480
 to be a springboard, like, oh, man, your name is Sarah.

706
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,520
 Awesome, Sarah.

707
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,420
 Hey, do you know where your name comes from?

708
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,360
 It comes from the story of a woman in the Bible

709
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,560
 who was married to Abraham.

710
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,520
 I actually worship the same God as Abraham and Sarah,

711
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,660
 the person who your name is from.

712
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,980
 Would you like to worship her?

713
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,760
 Him, him.

714
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,480
 I mean, it's just different ways

715
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,680
 where you can springboard into it

716
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,160
 in any direction that you go.

717
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,200
 Hey, this weekend or last weekend

718
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,060
 or whatever weekend is Easter,

719
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,900
 do you know what your plans are?

720
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,740
 What are you doing on Easter?

721
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,160
 What do you believe happened at Easter?

722
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,320
 We just look for a way to connect.

723
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,400
 We look to, man, it's really stressful

724
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,120
 and someone's sharing about just the anxiety

725
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,040
 that they have about their job.

726
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,020
 Gosh, I get anxious sometimes, too.

727
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,980
 Do you know what helps me when I'm anxious?

728
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,000
 And we just try to springboard into our faith.

729
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,960
 We connect with people wherever they are

730
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,440
 and then we confront and we confront them with Christ

731
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,520
 and let the message of Jesus and that alone

732
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,480
 be the turning point inside of life,

733
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,520
 just like Paul did where he says,

734
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,960
 look, I'm gonna share, I'm gonna connect with you

735
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,520
 and I'm not gonna shy away from speaking

736
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,400
 about the resurrection and the one Savior

737
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,560
 of the entire world.

738
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,900
 Same thing for you and I.

739
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,080
 I got to experience this a couple days ago

740
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,600
 where I came home from work, getting sick, apologize,

741
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,680
 and there was AT&T was in my driveway.

742
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,200
 There was a guy who was going door to door

743
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,520
 to sell AT&T services and pull up

744
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,520
 and we don't have AT&T and don't want AT&T

745
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,000
 and roll down the window and I'm like,

746
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,160
 what's going on, man?

747
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,200
 Hey, do you want to, you wanted to talk about AT&T.

748
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,520
 We're actually okay, we're good, thank you so much,

749
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
 but God bless you, man, it's hot out here.

750
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,760
 And then I begin to pull the car up

751
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,200
 and he says, hey, hey, hey, it is hot, man,

752
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,480
 you got any water?

753
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,240
 And I look in the car and then he goes, I can wait.

754
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,040
 And I was like, great, all right, well, I'll pull the car in.

755
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,440
 So I pull the car in, I go in, grab water,

756
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,080
 I come outside and give him water and say,

757
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,920
 hey, what's your name?

758
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,320
 He said, Yusuf.

759
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,720
 And I said, Yusuf, huh, where's that come from?

760
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,760
 He said, oh, it comes from the name Joseph.

761
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,920
 Hey, you laughed at the name thing, but this, it works.

762
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,760
 Joseph, no way, man.

763
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,840
 Okay, are you someone who is familiar

764
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,920
 with the story of Joseph?

765
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,560
 Are you a follower of Christ?

766
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,760
 And we were into the conversation.

767
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,280
 And he began to say, no, I'm not,

768
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,840
 I kind of was raised in church,

769
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,080
 but honestly, man, I've done a lot of bad things

770
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,040
 and I can't say that I'm a Christian anymore.

771
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,360
 And I don't think that the God who's there would accept me.

772
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,520
 I've done a lot of bad stuff

773
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,400
 and I feel like I'm doing a lot of bad stuff.

774
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,040
 And I said, Yusuf, I don't know your story,

775
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,240
 I don't know what you're doing.

776
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
 Here's what I know.

777
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,360
 The message of Christianity is not,

778
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,520
 as long as you're not a bad person, God will accept you.

779
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,920
 In fact, the message of Christianity is that

780
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,640
 the only ones who God will accept

781
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,200
 are those who acknowledge I'm not a good person.

782
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,900
 I'm not a good enough person to save myself.

783
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,200
 As good as I think I am, I'm sinful.

784
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
 And if I'm ever gonna experience a relationship with God,

785
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,720
 it's gonna be by grace through faith

786
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,800
 or by trusting what Jesus did on the cross,

787
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,980
 paying for my sins.

788
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,520
 Dying in my place and rising from the grave.

789
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,880
 Not by me trying to earn my way to God

790
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,840
 by being a good person.

791
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,000
 So I don't know what your story is,

792
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,360
 I don't know what you're involved in,

793
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
 but I know whatever it is, it won't keep you out of heaven

794
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,400
 if you trust in the one thing that will get you in,

795
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,460
 which is Jesus.

796
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,320
 And we began to dialogue and I said,

797
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,600
 have you ever heard that before?

798
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
 You know, you said you were raised in church.

799
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,120
 He said, no.

800
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,100
 And at some point, we were just talking about Watermark

801
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,140
 and him coming here and he was like, man, I'm intrigued.

802
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,700
 I've never heard that message before.

803
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,940
 That is, I wanna come.

804
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,980
 And he said, does your church,

805
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,460
 like do they program you to talk like this?

806
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,740
 (congregation laughing)

807
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,220
 Or tell me this, why did you share?

808
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,060
 And what Yusuf needed to know

809
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,300
 is not that there's a God or a church that programs you,

810
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,820
 there's a God who programmed the world

811
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,860
 to work in a certain way.

812
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,140
 And it's God who's programmed every human heart

813
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,860
 to the reality that it will not find satisfaction,

814
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,900
 it will not find life apart from a relationship

815
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,540
 with that God who programmed it, who created the world,

816
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,220
 who created them to live in existence with him.

817
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,500
 And what I looked and said to Yusuf is, no,

818
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,660
 no, there wasn't a program.

819
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,900
 What moved me to share, here's what I believe, Yusuf,

820
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,080
 I think the God of this world loves you so much

821
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,540
 that he brought you to this house right now

822
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,300
 and he made you thirsty so that you would want water,

823
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,340
 so that would bridge into a conversation

824
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,140
 about the God who hasn't given up on you,

825
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,360
 hasn't forgotten you, and who loves you enough

826
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,740
 to die in your place, if you'll accept it,

827
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,260
 you'll experience eternity with him forever and ever and ever.

828
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,100
 And he looked and he said, this is how I could tell

829
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,180
 he'd been raised in church before, he goes,

830
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,900
 man, you have given me much more than water.

831
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,620
 You have given me living water.

832
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,140
 (laughing)

833
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,180
 I was like, man, you have definitely been

834
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,380
 in Sunday school at some point.

835
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,100
 John chapter four is where that came from.

836
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,940
 And he said, I'm gonna call you,

837
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,060
 I'm gonna come next Sunday.

838
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,080
 And so who knows?

839
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,060
 But in sharing our faith, man, we seek to just connect.

840
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,260
 Sometimes it involves like meeting a physical need

841
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,900
 before being able to share on a physical need,

842
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,740
 but we seek to connect and then we confront

843
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,660
 just with Christ, we point people to Christ.

844
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,480
 Not our behavior, their behavior, any of those things,

845
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,300
 we confront them with Christ, connect,

846
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,040
 and then confront them with Christ.

847
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,100
 Paul then goes into what happens when he shares this message

848
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,820
 with these Athenians and what takes place in their response.

849
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,180
 Verse 32, when they heard the good news about Jesus,

850
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,020
 they fell on their knees and said,

851
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,420
 I believe in Jesus, he will save me forever.

852
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,940
 No, that's not there at all.

853
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,940
 You guys are not reading along with me.

854
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,980
 That's what we would think, or that's a lot of times

855
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,340
 what we think it would say.

856
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
 It's not what it says at all.

857
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
 Look what happens.

858
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,300
 In other words, it's not something like,

859
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,700
 oh man, you share and all of a sudden,

860
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,620
 everybody for sure, every time gets saved.

861
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,900
 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead,

862
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,940
 some sneered.

863
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,780
 (exhaling)

864
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,660
 Oh God, resurrection, okay.

865
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,740
 Some become critical.

866
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,340
 Others said, we wanna hear you again on this subject.

867
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,320
 But some were curious, like Yusuf.

868
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,340
 And at that, Paul left the council and some people

869
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,060
 became followers of Paul and believed.

870
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,140
 Among them was Dionysus, a member of the Areopagus,

871
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,380
 one of the 30, and also a woman named Damaris

872
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
 and a number of others that Paul shared.

873
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,860
 There were some who were critical,

874
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,260
 some who became curious.

875
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,460
 I just wanna hear more.

876
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,260
 And then some converted.

877
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,700
 That anytime that you and I share the message,

878
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
 our third idea from the text,

879
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,200
 so we have the motivation for sharing,

880
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,180
 the method by which we share,

881
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,380
 which is connect and confront to Christ,

882
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,700
 and then the mixed reactions that our message creates.

883
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,580
 We have a message that creates the message of Jesus.

884
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,780
 It just creates mixed reactions, just like in Paul's.

885
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,620
 If you ever share your faith,

886
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,460
 you go outside of this room,

887
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,100
 you're gonna share with different people in your family,

888
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,980
 different people you work with,

889
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,100
 different people you interact with.

890
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,940
 If you share your faith,

891
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
 you're gonna fall into three categories.

892
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,260
 The response that people have to the name of Jesus.

893
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,820
 They either are critical,

894
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,140
 I don't need that, I don't believe that,

895
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,180
 I'm spiritual, man, I got my own way.

896
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,820
 They reject it, they're curious,

897
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,580
 wow, you actually believe this.

898
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,860
 I don't think I've ever met a Christian

899
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,940
 who actually believes this.

900
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,420
 And they wanna hear more.

901
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,340
 They're critical, curious,

902
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,780
 and sometimes they convert.

903
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,580
 They trust in Jesus.

904
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,560
 That whenever we share the message of Jesus,

905
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,140
 there's mixed reactions that take place.

906
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,020
 That there's people who, man,

907
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,860
 when you share your faith,

908
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,140
 they're just, Jesus said,

909
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,460
 I came, Matthew chapter 10,

910
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,020
 that I came to bring division.

911
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,740
 That you should expect when you share your faith,

912
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,180
 some people are gonna hate you for it.

913
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,940
 They hated me first.

914
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,820
 Other people are, like Yusuf, gonna be curious.

915
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,340
 And then sometimes, rarely,

916
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,940
 man, they're gonna on the spot say, I trust in Jesus.

917
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,020
 Which for the most part, for a lot of us,

918
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,180
 at least from my experience,

919
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,120
 is very much the outlier.

920
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,960
 Outside of these doors,

921
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,160
 outside of church and ministry and mission trips,

922
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,920
 when you're just interacting with people out in public

923
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,400
 or strangers, when you share your faith,

924
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,240
 very rarely, at one time in the last eight years,

925
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,080
 has someone ever been like,

926
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,840
 man, I wanna trust Christ right now in this moment.

927
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
 But we're just planting seeds.

928
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,440
 Here's why this is important for you to know.

929
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,800
 Because as you share your faith,

930
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,440
 as any of us, if you're a follower of Christ,

931
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,600
 which you have a responsibility, according to Jesus, to do,

932
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,760
 as you share your faith,

933
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,400
 the measure of success is not

934
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,340
 which category did they fall into.

935
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,520
 The measure of success is sharing.

936
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,000
 In other words, I think for a lot of us,

937
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,920
 we were coming in the night and I said,

938
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,160
 hey, what is a successful,

939
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,600
 what would be success when it comes to sharing your faith?

940
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,440
 Like at the end of the day, like,

941
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,080
 hey, that was a win, put a W up on the board.

942
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,120
 Like, what would be a success?

943
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,840
 If everyone got an answer inside of their head of,

944
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
 oh man, what is successful

945
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
 when it comes to sharing your faith?

946
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,040
 I think a lot of us would go,

947
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,340
 if they like pray the prayer and trust Jesus right there,

948
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,740
 and Paul would say, no.

949
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,860
 It's not your job to save or my job to save.

950
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,480
 Success comes in sharing.

951
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,360
 Whatever the response,

952
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,320
 that a successful success

953
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,880
 as it relates to sharing your faith in my faith

954
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,100
 is simply in sharing the message of Jesus.

955
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,400
 And let God do what only God can do,

956
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,240
 which is save people like Dionysus,

957
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,960
 or create curiosity inside of the hearts of people

958
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,880
 and move them.

959
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,920
 Our job is not to save, it's simply to share.

960
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,120
 And Paul says, look, of course I'm gonna share my faith

961
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,320
 and I'm gonna let God determine the outcome.

962
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,360
 For most of us,

963
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,340
 man, and I have deep sympathy for this,

964
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,920
 but I think the reason why we don't share our faith

965
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
 is for one reason or one word.

966
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,760
 You know what it is?

967
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,280
 Awkward.

968
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,560
 We're like, oh gosh, it's just,

969
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,600
 I don't know if I can do it.

970
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,340
 It's just gonna create a little awkward tension

971
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,180
 in the moment.

972
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,920
 It's gonna be awkward inside of that conversation

973
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,760
 and what are they gonna think?

974
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,960
 If they're gonna think of some weirdo

975
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,280
 and just gonna make it weird around the office,

976
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,720
 or it's gonna be awkward with this person,

977
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,880
 or maybe they're gonna feel uncomfortable.

978
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,120
 I don't wanna make them feel uncomfortable

979
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,280
 and it's just too awkward.

980
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,880
 I don't wanna feel uncomfortable.

981
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,840
 And can you imagine having that conversation

982
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,940
 with the apostle Paul?

983
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,800
 Like, wait a second,

984
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
 the reason you're not sharing your faith?

985
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,720
 I mean, Paul, who like suffered.

986
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,880
 In 2 Timothy chapter two, he says,

987
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,480
 "Look, I will suffer anything

988
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,260
 "to spread the message of Christianity.

989
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,680
 "Whatever it takes, whatever it costs,

990
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,520
 "whatever they do to me,

991
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,960
 "I will suffer whatever it is

992
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,000
 "in order to move forward the message of Christianity

993
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,100
 "because everyone lives forever somewhere.

994
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,680
 "I need to get the message out to people

995
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,880
 "that there's a God who loves them.

996
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,440
 "He's not asking them to do something.

997
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,600
 "He died for them in their place.

998
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
 "And if they'll trust in him,

999
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,640
 "they'll have eternal life."

1000
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,040
 And he says, "Whatever it takes, I'll suffer anything."

1001
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,800
 2 Timothy chapter two tells us.

1002
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,680
 And when you go, man, what did Paul actually suffer?

1003
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,920
 They're like, what was he really willing?

1004
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,640
 You read the story and you see,

1005
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,640
 Paul in 2 Corinthians talks about some of the things

1006
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,700
 that he suffered and he says,

1007
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,160
 "I was whipped with a cat of nine tails."

1008
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,920
 It was essentially a whip with metal spikes on the end.

1009
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,080
 Five different times.

1010
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,360
 Each of the different times, it was 39 lashes.

1011
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,180
 That's how many times.

1012
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,360
 So on five different occasions,

1013
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,480
 I was whipped with these metal spikes on the end.

1014
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,840
 Someone who was whipped with a cat of nine tails

1015
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,080
 often was so permanently disfigured

1016
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,280
 that you couldn't even tell where the back would begin.

1017
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,440
 Paul, many people didn't live.

1018
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,200
 Five different occasions he was whipped.

1019
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,800
 Three chapters earlier, he's sharing the message of Jesus.

1020
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,080
 The crowd gets angry at him

1021
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,680
 and they begin to pelt him with rocks or stone him.

1022
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,580
 Not like stone, like, yeah, but like stone him with rocks.

1023
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,760
 To the point where they think he's dead

1024
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
 and they drag him outside his city.

1025
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,860
 And miraculously, at some point he wakes up.

1026
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,680
 Three different times he says, "I was shipwrecked."

1027
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,880
 I mean, which is amazing.

1028
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,260
 He just kept getting on the boat.

1029
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,740
 He's like, "I don't care what it takes.

1030
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
 "I'm gonna get on that thing."

1031
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,420
 Versus like, "Let me just take the camel."

1032
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,160
 And he's like, "Whatever it takes, I'm gonna go.

1033
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,000
 "I'm gonna spread the message.

1034
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,780
 "Whatever it costs me, I'm willing to suffer anything

1035
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,980
 "for the sake of God's people to get the message everywhere

1036
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,180
 "because everyone lives forever somewhere."

1037
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,060
 It's like embarrassing as Americans.

1038
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,860
 When you think of like if the apostle Paul was here

1039
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,060
 and he was like, "Guys, how's it going?

1040
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,500
 "You sharing your faith?"

1041
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,100
 No, it's just, yeah, tell me about it.

1042
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,200
 What are they, are they throwing you to lions?

1043
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
 Are they throwing you in the dungeon?

1044
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,440
 They trying to cut your head off?

1045
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
 They whipping you?

1046
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,100
 Is that what's going?

1047
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,880
 No, man, are they taking your family?

1048
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,720
 Are they taking things from you?

1049
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,720
 No, it's just, it's just awkward.

1050
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,640
 [congregation laughing]

1051
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,640
 You'd be like, "What?

1052
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,800
 "What does that even, what is that, modern form of torture

1053
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,640
 "that they've created?

1054
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,040
 "Like we wouldn't even have a category for it."

1055
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,780
 And yet, maybe because, man, we live in like the land

1056
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,760
 of the free, our pain tolerance is so low.

1057
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,420
 Some of us, the most godly thing we can do tonight

1058
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,700
 is say, "God, will you kill my fear of it being awkward?

1059
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,200
 "Will you kill the part of my heart that's afraid,

1060
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,580
 "that's not compassionate and not motivated

1061
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,980
 "by compassion towards people?

1062
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,460
 "Will you help me to seek to connect and care

1063
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,620
 "and confront people, not with my opinion

1064
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,880
 "and my political ideas, but with the gospel,

1065
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,380
 "with Christ alone?

1066
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,400
 "And will you help me in the face of mixed reactions

1067
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,460
 "to not lose heart, to see it as success,

1068
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,340
 "to allow you to stretch out your hand and save,

1069
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,500
 "and to see it as a success by just sharing

1070
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,700
 "the message of eternal life?"

1071
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,780
 There's only one way that they can experience that.

1072
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,620
 Will you help me, Lord?

1073
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,040
 And the most godly thing I think for most of us,

1074
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,040
 'cause if any of the polls are accurate,

1075
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,140
 then 80% of us would say we agree,

1076
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,340
 the Christians in the room, and then the vast majority

1077
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,300
 would say, "Yeah, we just don't do it."

1078
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,580
 And so asking the God of angel armies,

1079
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:51,620
 come win in this heart, come move this heart

1080
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,380
 with compassion towards those around me

1081
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,380
 who will never know the message of Christ

1082
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,140
 apart from someone sharing it with them.

1083
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,260
 In conclusion, our motivation is compassion.

1084
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,780
 Our method is to connect and to confront with Christ,

1085
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,160
 and our message creates mixed reactions.

1086
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,920
 We have this expression in culture

1087
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,440
 that essentially is like,

1088
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,700
 "Hey, that's not a hill I would die on."

1089
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,940
 And it's things like we hold loosely,

1090
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,940
 that, "Hey, I think that the warriors

1091
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,280
 "are better than whatever,

1092
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,120
 "but it's not a hill I would die on.

1093
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,620
 "I think that Pepsi's better than Coke,

1094
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,240
 "but not a hill I would die on."

1095
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,180
 I think for many of us, that's how your Christian faith is.

1096
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,500
 That you're like, "Yes, I love Jesus, and sure,

1097
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,960
 "I think if you're asking me to share,

1098
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,760
 "and I like church and all this stuff,

1099
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,500
 "but it's not a hill I would die on.

1100
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,960
 "I'm not gonna do it if it costs me anything.

1101
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,240
 "I'm not gonna do it if it costs me relationships

1102
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,520
 "or friends or kind of makes me uncomfortable

1103
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,300
 "or I could lose my job over it.

1104
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,640
 "It's not something, it's not really a hill

1105
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,860
 "that I would die on."

1106
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:01,400
 And the Apostle Paul, 2,000 years ago,

1107
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,120
 walks up Mars Hill, a hill,

1108
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,720
 and he looks into the eyes of 30 men

1109
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,840
 who literally hold his life in the balance.

1110
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,920
 They, very shortly or a few hundred years before,

1111
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,840
 had put to death Socrates for believing

1112
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,720
 the exact same thing, proclaiming foreign deities,

1113
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,200
 the exact same words.

1114
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,780
 And he looks these men in the eyes and says,

1115
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,400
 "Look, this is a hill I will die on.

1116
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,780
 "Not just Mars Hill and Aries Hill,

1117
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,420
 "but the hill of the reality and the truth

1118
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,060
 "that Jesus is the only way.

1119
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,460
 "There is one God out there.

1120
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,100
 "All of these other gods will fall.

1121
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,700
 "2,000 years from now, every Zeus, every idol,

1122
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,740
 "every statue will not be here.

1123
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,400
 "There will be one God that is worshiped all over

1124
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,820
 "this land, all over the West.

1125
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,840
 "It will spread like wildfire."

1126
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,480
 The message of Christianity,

1127
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,920
 the message of the God who was there,

1128
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,080
 who is love, who sent his son into the world

1129
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,920
 to die in your place.

1130
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,420
 "It is a hill I will die on.

1131
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,160
 "You can kill me, but this is something

1132
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,760
 "I will not let go without being said.

1133
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,640
 "And I'm willing to die on this hill."

1134
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,000
 And for those of us in the room who are like,

1135
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,880
 "Man, I don't know if I would share my faith.

1136
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,320
 "It's just not really a hill I would die on."

1137
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,400
 I want you to know the hill that Jesus died on,

1138
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,260
 a hill called Golgotha.

1139
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,280
 Why did he do it?

1140
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,080
 Because just like even the message and motivation of Paul

1141
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,600
 that, "Hey, I love these people so much.

1142
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,620
 "I want them to know that God that is there

1143
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,380
 "does not have to be unknown,

1144
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,900
 "that the God who is there is reaching out to them

1145
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,480
 "and wants them to know,

1146
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,680
 "wants them to know that he's done something for them

1147
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,940
 "if they would just accept what he did on the cross

1148
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,800
 "in their place and it moved him to die on a hill."

1149
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,880
 It was a hill he would die on called Golgotha.

1150
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,880
 It's a hill that Paul stood before this Athenian group

1151
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,700
 and said, "It's the only hill worth dying on.

1152
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,600
 "It's the only hill that will last for all eternity.

1153
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,400
 "All of these gods will fall."

1154
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,960
 And today, the one true God is reaching out

1155
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,320
 through the hands and feet of Christ, which Paul was,

1156
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,040
 and you are if you're a Christian,

1157
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,380
 to say, "This is the message of eternal life.

1158
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,400
 "There is no other.

1159
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,100
 "And this is the God who is there.

1160
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,320
 "There is no other."

1161
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 Can I tell you about him?

1162
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,240
 He wants to be known and I wanna tell you about him.

1163
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,080
 Let me pray.

1164
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:21,260
 Father, we need your help.

1165
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:30,600
 We live in a world that every day sends the message

1166
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,600
 that you can talk about everything but religion and politics

1167
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,200
 but we live in a world where it's so quick

1168
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,040
 to either get offensive or tense or any of those things

1169
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,360
 when you bring up the conversation,

1170
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,520
 specifically the name of the one Savior, Jesus.

1171
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,760
 So would you move in the hearts of your people,

1172
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,120
 starting with me, and inspire courageous faith?

1173
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,020
 Would you move us to act?

1174
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,920
 Would you make us winsome engagers

1175
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,600
 as we move in conversation?

1176
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,720
 I pray for my friends in the room

1177
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,300
 who have never shared their faith before ever.

1178
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,060
 That you would allow whatever barriers exist there,

1179
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,780
 whatever personal wirings, introversion,

1180
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,620
 whatever it is that holds them back

1181
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,060
 from wanting to say something,

1182
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,460
 whatever fear of making something uncomfortable,

1183
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,540
 fear of the person having questions they can't answer,

1184
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,020
 whatever those obstacles would you win,

1185
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,940
 take them down in the way that you took them down

1186
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,540
 in the heart of Saul, who you converted to Paul,

1187
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,060
 who changed the world.

1188
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,060
 Father, we thank you for your love.

1189
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,460
 Father, we thank you that we worship the one true God

1190
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,660
 who that in a thousand years

1191
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,520
 will still be enthroned and worshiped,

1192
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,360
 either in this life or in the next, should you return.

1193
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,620
 Would you win inside of this city?

1194
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,940
 Would you start a revival and start with this group

1195
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,440
 and unleash your people and the message

1196
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,580
 and the hope of eternal life that is found in Christ alone?

1197
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,480
 We worship you in song, amen.
