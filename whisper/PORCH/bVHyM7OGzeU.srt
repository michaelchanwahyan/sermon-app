 HEY, IT'S GOING TO BE AN AMAZING NIGHT.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 WE'RE BACK IN OUR SERIES IN THE BOOK OF COLOSSIANS.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 BUT TO GET THINGS STARTED, I WANTED TO SHARE A QUICK STORY,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 AN OPENING ILLUSTRATION WITH YOU.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 HOW MANY OF YOU IN HERE HAVE EVER BEEN WHITE WATER RAFTING?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 ANYBODY SHOW OF HANDS?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 YEAH, SOME OF US.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 FAIR NUMBER.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN WHITE WATER RAFTING, THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE YOU STILL REMEMBER TO THIS DAY.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I KNOW THAT'S TRUE FOR ME.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 LIKE WHEN I WENT, I CAN STILL REMEMBER IN VIVID DETAIL,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 LIKE THE ANTICIPATION OF THAT FIRST RAPID.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 OH MY GOSH, LIKE THERE IT IS.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF OUR TEAM.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 LIKE PULL!

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 LIKE WE WERE ALL ROWING IN ONE DIRECTION,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 AIMING ACCORDING TO THE COURSE OF WHAT OUR GOD WAS GIVING US.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 I REMEMBER THE CANYON WALLS.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 LIKE THEY WERE JUST SOARING UP AROUND US.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 WE FELT SO SMALL IN THE BASE OF THAT CANYON.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 AND I REMEMBER THE INTENSITY OF JUST TRYING TO NAVIGATE

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THIS RAPID.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 LIKE THIS RIVER WAS WIDE AND THEN IT WAS NARROW

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 AND THEN IT WAS SMOOTH AND THEN IT WAS RUSHING.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 LIKE I REMEMBER ALL OF THE STRATEGY THAT WENT INTO IT.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I REMEMBER LIKE THE COLDNESS OF THE WATER, YOU KNOW?

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 LIKE I REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER MOST CLEARLY OF ALL?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 THE SAFETY TALK

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 THAT OUR TOUR GUIDE GAVE US BEFORE WE EVER EVEN STEPPED FOOT IN THE BOAT.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 WHY?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 WHY DID I PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SAFETY TALK?

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 IT SEEMS KIND OF ODD.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 WELL, WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN MY BACKGROUND

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 THE CLOSEST THING TO A WHITE WATER RAPID I'D EVER GOTTEN

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 WAS JUST LIKE KIND OF FLOATING DOWN THE LAZY RIVER

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 AT THE LOCAL WATER PARK.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 YOU KNOW LIKE I HAD NOT HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OR EXPOSURE

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 AND TO WHAT AWAITED ME IN THAT COLORADO RIVER IN SPECIFIC.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 AND SO WHEN HE WENT INTO A FULL DISSERTATION

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 OF THE DANGERS THAT WE COULD EXPECT

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I PAID ATTENTION.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 LIKE I LEANED IN AND I LEARNED AS MUCH AS I COULD

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I WAS WELL PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS OUT AHEAD OF US.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 AND SO AS HE WALKED THROUGH IT ALL

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I KNEW.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 LIKE MAN IF THE BOAT'S ABOUT TO CAPSIZE

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW MY BODY WEIGHT THAT DIRECTION

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 SO THAT WAY WE CAN RELEVEL THIS THING OUT.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 OR IF I FIND MYSELF FOR SOME REASON OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 WHICH IS REALLY NOT RECOMMENDED

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU STAY IN THE BOAT AT ALL COSTS

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 BUT IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 WHAT YOU SHOULD DO

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 IS YOU SHOULD MAKE LIKE MICHAEL PHELPS BABY

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 AND YOU SHOULD SWIM TO WHATEVER SHORE IS CLOSEST TO YOU.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 LIKE IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 AND THINGS ARE GETTING DICY OUT THERE

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 YOU ASSUME THE PROPER POSITION

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 YOU GET ON YOUR BACK

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 AND YOU FLOAT WITH YOUR LEGS POINTED DOWNSTREAM

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 AND YOUR KNEES SLIGHTLY BENT

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 THAT WAY YOU CAN PUSH OFF OF ANY ROCKS

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF BUMPING UP AGAINST

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 BUT YOU DON'T JUST SIT LIKE THIS

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 YOU SPREAD YOUR ARMS OUT WIDE

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU NAVIGATE

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 AND MANEUVER THROUGH THE WATER

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I REMEMBER ALL OF IT

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 LIKE I AM SO STILL TO THIS DAY

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 LIKE I HAVE SUCH CLARITY OF WHAT THAT MOMENT FELT LIKE

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 WHY?

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 BUT I WAS ALSO EXCITED

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I KNEW I WAS SETTING OUT INTO SOMETHING

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 THAT WAS SO MEANINGFUL

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 BUT I ALSO KNEW

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 BECAUSE OF THAT SAFETY TALK

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I WAS STEPPING OUT INTO SOMETHING

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 THAT WAS DANGEROUS TOO

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 YOU SEE MY GOD SAID IT BEST

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY LIFE INSIDE THE BOAT

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 THEN YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR DANGERS

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 OUTSIDE THE BOAT

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 WHY DO I TELL YOU THAT?

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 BECAUSE THE SAME THING IS TRUE

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I AM NOT A BAD GUY

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

316
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000

 I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I AM NOT A BAD PERSON

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 This is what all of these religious observances are.

321
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They're really good.

322
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 They're really beautiful.

323
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 So what does Paul mean when he says

324
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 they're a shadow of the things to come?

325
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 What's he mean by that?

326
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Well, think about a shadow.

327
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 What's a shadow?

328
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 A shadow is an immaterial shape

329
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 of a material subject.

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Y'all tracking with that?

331
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 In my green room just a minute ago

332
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I was just kind of working through the rhythm of this thing, you know?

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And as I'm doing it, I looked to my left

334
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 and my shadow is just kind of dancing along with me.

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I can see it right now. It's right here in front of me.

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 This shadow has no substance in and of itself.

337
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But it points to that which does have substance.

338
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 You tracking?

339
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 That's what he's saying here.

340
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 He's saying, "Hey, all of these Old Testament religious observances,

341
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 every rule, every regulation that God gave,

342
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 they were never the point.

343
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 But they were pointing to the point."

344
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 It's like this.

345
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 In the Old Testament, they would sacrifice

346
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 perfect, spotless lamb

347
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 because it was through the sacrifice of that lamb

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 that they would receive forgiveness for their sins.

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 That was a shadow of the substance, which is Jesus Christ,

350
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 the Lamb of God,

351
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 which has come to take away all the sins of the world.

352
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 We don't have to repeatedly sacrifice any longer

353
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 because His sacrifice was enough,

354
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 fully and finally sufficient forever.

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Sabbath.

356
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 God instituted a day where we would take time

357
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 and we would rest in His goodness.

358
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 We would rest from any work in which we would do.

359
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 But in Christ, we see the fullness of that.

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 That He has become our rest.

361
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 That we don't have to earn and work and strive and strain

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 and sweat by the toil of our brow any longer.

363
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 We can rest in the fact

364
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 that everything He's done,

365
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 all the work He's performed, it's enough.

366
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 We don't have to strive any longer.

367
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Do you see it?

368
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 All of these things, they're shadows of the substance.

369
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Jesus is the one that all of it's pointing to.

370
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 He has come and He has fulfilled every letter of the law.

371
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And so guess what?

372
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 We don't need to pay attention to them.

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 We need to pay attention to Him.

374
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 That's what Paul's pointing to.

375
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 That's what he's saying.

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 He's looking at me saying,

377
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 "Hey, there's a bunch of people around you

378
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 "and there's a bunch of things you should do."

379
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And he's like, "Don't do those things."

380
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Because Christ already did them.

381
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 He already completed them.

382
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 He already accomplished them.

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 You don't need to pay attention to them any longer.

384
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 You need to pay attention to Him.

385
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 That's why he's saying,

386
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 "Hey, don't indulge the shadow amidst the substance."

387
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It would kind of be like this.

388
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Say it's date night at the Perry house.

389
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And your boy, he's got plans, all right?

390
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Like I've decided to work up like a three-course menu.

391
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I'm working in the kitchen all day.

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I bought fresh flowers.

393
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I lit some candles.

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I made sure the place was picked up and cleaned for my bride.

395
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And then she walks in the door

396
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 and she sits down to dine and delight.

397
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And I look at her and say, "What are you doing?

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 "That seat's not for you."

399
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And I go and I grab a picture of her

400
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and I set it across from me.

401
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 This is what it's about.

402
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 That would be crazy.

403
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 That would feel so ludicrous.

404
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And yet, that's the point Paul's making.

405
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 That's the kind of thinking he's exposing.

406
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 He's looking at them and he's saying,

407
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 "Hey, do not let anyone illegitimize your faith

408
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 "because you're not following a bunch of

409
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 "unnecessary regulations."

410
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Like you don't value the picture.

411
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You value the subject, right?

412
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's not about what's in the frame.

413
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's about the one whom the frame depicts.

414
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 He says it like this in a different verse.

415
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He says in Galatians 3, 3, "Are you so foolish?

416
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 "Having begun by the spirit,

417
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 "are you now being perfected by the flesh?"

418
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 What's he getting at?

419
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It is impossible, it is impossible

420
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 to perfect yourself by your own strength.

421
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Say impossible with me.

422
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Impossible.

423
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's impossible, do you get it?

424
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It is impossible to perfect yourself by your own strength.

425
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Like we don't deepen our spirituality

426
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 with a can-do attitude

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 and by giving it the good college try.

428
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 That's not how you grow.

429
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 You grow by loving him.

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 That's how it happens.

431
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Like all the religious observance

432
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 that he's speaking to here,

433
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 any obedience you feel the need to adhere to,

434
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 it is a response from your love for God.

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Not an action you're working up

436
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 to earn his favor,

437
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 to merit his approval.

438
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And yet here's what's so fascinating.

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 This is such a prevalent issue in the church today.

440
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And well beyond the walls of this place,

441
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 it's a prevalent issue in the world today.

442
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 But what I think is crazy is the fact that

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 if you look around and you observe what ministers are saying,

444
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 this is nothing new.

445
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Like people today are prescribing

446
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 a variety of steps you should take

447
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 or they're peddling some solution you should adopt

448
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 so that way you can become like Jesus.

449
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So they look at you and they say things like,

450
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 "Hey, here's how to kill porn.

451
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 "Here's how to overcome your laziness.

452
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 "Here's how to live a stress-free life.

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 "Here's six steps to make sure you're never lazy again."

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They start prescribing all of these steps,

455
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 all of these how-tos,

456
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 all of these lists of to-dos,

457
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 so that way you'll adhere to them

458
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and you'll buy into the promise,

459
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 "This is going to make me like Jesus."

460
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And yet what happens is you've only signed up

461
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 for another religious observance.

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Your effort doesn't make you like Him.

463
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Your love for Him

464
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 and desire to walk with Him and be with Him in due time

465
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 will make you like Him.

466
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You see, here's what's fascinating about this idea,

467
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 that we can merit our Christlikeness.

468
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 We can kind of grit and bear our way into becoming like Him.

469
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The interesting thing about it

470
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 is it ultimately just leaves us with something to brag about.

471
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 That's all it does.

472
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Like, man, I've never missed a Sunday service.

473
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 I'm always the one that speaks up in community group.

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Every time we go around and we confess sin,

475
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I confess three.

476
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 We think that doing all of these things

477
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 makes us more like Jesus,

478
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and yet here is the issue.

479
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 If it all depends upon you,

480
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 what ends up happening is it either leads to your pride,

481
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 because, boy, you did it.

482
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 You kept all six steps,

483
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 or it leads to your despair

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 because you can't do it.

485
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Jesus is trying to free us from that,

486
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 and that's what Paul is advocating for in this section.

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He's saying, "Hey, don't subscribe to a self-help gospel

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 that God helps those who help themselves,"

489
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 which sounds right.

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Like, man, yeah, I think God is going to help me

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 if I do help myself, but here's the thing, porch.

492
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 God does not help those who help themselves.

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 He helps those that cannot help themselves.

494
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 That's the nature of the gospel.

495
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 God looks upon people, and He says,

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 "No, you can't do it, but I can do it,

497
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 so you cling fast to me.

498
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You stay connected to me,

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 and as we walk together, you know what's going to happen?

500
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 You're going to become like me,

501
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 but you stay close. You hold fast."

502
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Now, am I looking at you and saying, "Man, you know what?

503
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Yeah, so you should just indulge in revelry

504
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 and be completely disobedient.

505
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You should never try a day in your life."

506
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 No, like that's not the point of all of this.

507
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Again, I just said it a minute ago.

508
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Obedience is a response to the one we love.

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I love you, God, so let me live my life.

510
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 My identity is in Christ.

511
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Now, look at my activity, which reflects His own.

512
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I don't obey so that way I can become like Him.

513
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 That's not how this thing works.

514
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Paul says it like this in Philippians 2, 12 and 13.

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 He says, "Therefore, my beloved,

516
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 as you have always obeyed, so now,

517
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 not only in my presence, but much more in my absence,

518
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."

519
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Do you feel the sense of responsibility on your life for that?

520
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Like, work it out, baby. Like, get after it.

521
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 You've got a sense of duty here,

522
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 and yet catch what it says in 13,

523
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 'cause you can never divorce these verses from each other.

524
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 "For it is God who works in you,

525
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 both to will and to work for His good pleasure."

526
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 We have a role to play, no doubt.

527
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 But here's the point I need you to take away.

528
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 If the influential voices in your life,

529
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 whoever it is you listen to,

530
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 if all they ever do is prescribe behavior

531
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and they never provoke the heart,

532
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 stop listening to them.

533
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 That is not the gospel.

534
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 The gospel is not, "Hey, He needs your help."

535
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 The gospel is, "You couldn't help yourself,

536
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 so He stepped down from heaven to help you in every way

537
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 you did not deserve."

538
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 This is the first threat that Paul's warning us away from.

539
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 He wants us to know, man,

540
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 it doesn't matter how good, wise, or well-meaning the advice is.

541
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It doesn't matter how much you love that pastor,

542
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 but specific rhythms that podcast is recommending,

543
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 you become like Christ by beholding Christ.

544
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 But that's not the only thing.

545
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It's not only that we don't grow through religious observances.

546
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 As Paul keeps going, he's going to tell us

547
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 that we also do not grow by way of mystical experiences.

548
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 So read this with me. It's in verse 18.

549
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He says, "Let no one disqualify you

550
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 insisting on asceticism and worship of angels,

551
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 going on in detail about visions,

552
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,

553
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 and not holding fast to the head,

554
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 from whom the whole body, the whole body,

555
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 nourished and knit together through its joints

556
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and its ligaments, grows with a growth that is of God."

557
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 As Paul keeps going, we get to verse 18.

558
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 He shifts his warning away from focusing on religious activity

559
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 to focusing very specifically on mystical sensitivity,

560
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 which actually reflects the spiritual spectrum

561
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 of our current context.

562
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 I did a lot of research.

563
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I actually had it all built out in here.

564
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 We just don't have time to walk all the way through it.

565
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But if you go and you look at the national surveys,

566
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 who do you think composes the group

567
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 that is most predominantly considered

568
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 spiritual but not religious?

569
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Who do you think it is? I'll give you one guess.

570
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You.

571
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 It's the 20 and 30-somethings of our world.

572
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 It's those that are your age.

573
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 It's those that are here in this room.

574
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 They are you.

575
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 You are the ones that would say, "I'm spiritual.

576
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I have an interest in spirituality.

577
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Sure, I have a decreasing interest in religiosity,

578
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 but I am very open to spirituality,"

579
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 which gives a lot of explanation for the eruption

580
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 of things like crystals and angel numbers

581
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 and manifestation and the law of self-attraction, right?

582
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And the idea of like the rebirth of Ouija boards

583
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 and tarot cards and horoscopes,

584
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 the rise of seances and spiritualism.

585
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 These things, they are making their way back

586
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 to the center of society, into the mainstream of our world.

587
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I was reading a national publication

588
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 that is revered for representing the interests

589
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 of young adults, and it was saying, yeah,

590
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 young adults today, the young people of America,

591
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 they have a belief in a higher power,

592
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 a stronger desire to be engaged with the supernatural

593
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 and an interest in personal spiritual experience

594
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 that transcends decades and times past.

595
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And so Paul's looking at you, and he's saying,

596
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 "Hey, the issues of this room

597
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 look a lot like the issues of this room."

598
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 The things that we feel, the pressures we face,

599
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 the desires we have, man,

600
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I want to be a part of something transcendent.

601
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 It's really not all that different

602
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 from what the believers in Colossae were confronted with.

603
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And yet it's interesting as you read through this,

604
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 just to add to the similarities between what they're facing

605
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 and what we're facing, is there's this idea of syncretism,

606
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 right, where I take a blend

607
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 of all of the different religious influences,

608
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 spiritual influences that I like,

609
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 that I admire, that I prefer,

610
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 and I just kind of mix them together

611
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 and I accept them as my own.

612
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Like, that's what's weird about this passage.

613
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 When you read through it, it's like, man, Paul,

614
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 what are you talking about?

615
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 You're talking about legalism,

616
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 you're talking about asceticism,

617
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 you're talking about spiritualism, moralism.

618
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Where does it end?

619
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Like, there's so many different philosophies,

620
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 and that's the point.

621
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 They are looking at a massive, a massive spiritual interest,

622
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 the likes of which we can relate.

623
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And so Paul looks at them and he says,

624
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 "Hey, you need to beware

625
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 "of seeking a spiritual feeling instead of Christ.

626
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 "You need to beware of seeking a spiritual feeling

627
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 "instead of Christ."

628
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 He tells these Colossian Christians to be careful

629
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 of people who delight in asceticism

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and the worship of angels.

631
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 What does that even mean?

632
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Well, asceticism is the idea that I attain spirituality

633
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 by way of self-denial.

634
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And the worship of angels is like on the other end

635
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 of the spectrum from that,

636
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 that it's not an issue of self-denial,

637
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 but it's a desire for self-enlightenment,

638
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 that there are a series of inferior spiritual beings

639
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 that all descend from God above,

640
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 that if I worship them, if I engage with them,

641
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 if I interact with them,

642
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 what happens is I get the chance

643
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 to spiritually enlighten myself.

644
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I get to reach and touch something that is supernatural

645
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 and otherworldly to my regular experience.

646
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 That's why Paul's confronting it.

647
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 You see, these people, they're looking,

648
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 they're looking at Jesus and they're saying

649
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 to this young group of people,

650
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 "He's fine.

651
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 "Jesus is great,

652
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 "but we're a syncretistic bunch.

653
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 "You should add some things onto him.

654
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "He's not sufficient in and of himself.

655
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 "You probably need to mix and match

656
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 "a couple of other philosophies that'll help you

657
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 "to actually feel everything you were wanting for

658
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 "because we know, man, sometimes he kind of lets you down.

659
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 "You know, it's just sometimes the day's really good

660
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 "and sometimes the day's really hard.

661
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 "Sometimes he feels really close

662
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 "and sometimes he feels really far.

663
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 "And so what you should do is you should just add some stuff.

664
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 "You should pile on some more spirituality.

665
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 "And what's going to happen is you're going to feel

666
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 "more transcendent, more spiritually enlightened,

667
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 "more inclined to the Godheads."

668
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Like, they're promoting an idea that I remember facing

669
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 whenever I went to buy my wife and I's new car recently.

670
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Like, I showed up and I knew exactly what I wanted.

671
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 I knew what I needed to take me from point A to point B.

672
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Like, whenever I, like, get my eyes set on something,

673
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I've got a job to do, like, I'm pretty obsessive.

674
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Like, I do a ton of research.

675
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 And so I made sure, like, I looked at all the comps

676
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 in the surrounding area.

677
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 I made sure that I had checked the make and the model.

678
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 I knew the styles and the trims that I wanted in specific.

679
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 I understood the gas mileage and knew, man,

680
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 this is the right car for me.

681
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And so I showed up and after test driving it

682
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 and visiting with the salesman a little bit

683
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and feeling like the guy was on my side

684
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 because that's just his job, I ended up sitting down

685
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 and saying, "Let's do it, man. Let's close the deal."

686
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And so I knew exactly the price that I had walked into

687
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 and yet he slides across the vehicle invoice

688
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 and that price does not match at all what I'd shown up for.

689
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Why?

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Because he put a bunch of add-ons to the thing.

691
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 He looked at my car and he said, "Man, it's great,

692
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "but it's just not enough.

693
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 "You know what you need? You need a windshield repair kit.

694
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "That's what you need because you're going to catch a rock man

695
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 "on the way home and you're going to be so upset

696
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 "you didn't get this. I already put it on there for you, brother.

697
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 "I took care of it.

698
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 "You also, you're going to want that Primo wax

699
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "that I love to put on all my clients' cars.

700
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "I added that in there for you, just common courtesy."

701
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 You know, like he just walked through these

702
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 and I was like, "Man, I don't need any of this stuff.

703
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 "This stuff does not enrich my experience of the car.

704
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 "It's just an add-on.

705
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 "It's just a supplemental improvement

706
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "that does not improve anything at all."

707
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 In the same way Paul is saying to these young believers in Colossae,

708
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 "I mean, it's all the add-ons

709
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 "that everybody wants to add on to Jesus."

710
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 He's saying he's sufficient.

711
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He's enough.

712
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 You don't need to add anything to him.

713
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 You don't need to supersize your spirituality

714
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 through a bunch of spiritual experiences.

715
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 That's not what you need to do to feel intensely connected to God.

716
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 There's no secret knowledge you need to learn,

717
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 no mystery you need to uncover

718
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 to find a deeper intimacy with God.

719
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Listen to me.

720
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 You want intimacy with God?

721
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 It's not hard to find.

722
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 It's so much simpler than we think.

723
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 I remember a couple years ago,

724
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I preached a message similar to this.

725
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I came down front.

726
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 The joy of preaching appears

727
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I get to visit with you down there.

728
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And so I was standing on the floor following service

729
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and a young lady came up to me

730
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and I was anticipating what her question might be.

731
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Like I'm very comfortable with the fact

732
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 that most people will come down

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and they have a circumstantial issue.

734
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And so they just want biblical guidance

735
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 on how to navigate through that.

736
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Man, what's God's will for my job?

737
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Or how do I navigate this struggling relationship?

738
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Or whatever it may be, overcome this sin?

739
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And so I'm standing there,

740
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I'm totally expecting that that's what she's gonna do.

741
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 She's gonna come down,

742
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 she's gonna ask me one of those questions.

743
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 But it's not at all what she did.

744
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 She just came up to me and she was like,

745
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 "How do I get what you have?"

746
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Like, you love God.

747
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I can see it.

748
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Like how do I get that?

749
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I want that.

750
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Now I don't normally make myself the point

751
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 or topic of any example.

752
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 I get far more unimpressive with time.

753
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Just stick around long enough and you'll see it.

754
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 But I point to it tonight

755
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 because she didn't come to me asking for some formula

756
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 she needed to complete to find intimacy with Jesus.

757
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 That's not what she was doing.

758
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 She came asking what simple steps she needed to take.

759
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And what I was delighted to tell her

760
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 is it's rather underwhelming.

761
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 You pray.

762
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 You pray not to get things from God

763
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 but because you get God when you do it.

764
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 You read.

765
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 You read his word not because you want to accrue

766
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 a bunch of head knowledge

767
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 but because you want to hear the words

768
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 of the one whom you love.

769
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 You spend time with him.

770
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And not just a fleeting moment or a passing prayer

771
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 while you're driving in the car.

772
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 You take time and you walk with him

773
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 and you listen to him and you speak with him.

774
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And what you'll find through these very simple steps

775
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 is intimacy.

776
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 And I just love that.

777
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 I love that God wants to be intimate.

778
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Wants to be connected with you and me so bad

779
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 that he's like, "I'm going to make it so simple

780
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 they can't mess it up.

781
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 I'm going to put it on the bottom shelf."

782
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 It's not that they've got to learn some secret knowledge

783
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 or ascribe to some elitist formula of spirituality.

784
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 No, you don't need any of that stuff.

785
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 What you need is just to spend time with me.

786
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 That's what he's saying.

787
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 How do you get close to anybody?

788
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 You spend time with them.

789
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 [pop]

790
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 [laughter]

791
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 That's what he's saying.

792
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 He's saying spend time.

793
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That's what he's wanting for.

794
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And that's why Paul is saying, "Hey,

795
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 if you want to come close to God,

796
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 it's not by spiritually ascending.

797
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 It's by seeing the fact that he's spiritually descended."

798
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Why? To get to you.

799
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Now listen, I'm not saying that Christians don't engage

800
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 in spiritual realities or experience.

801
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 That's not what I'm saying at all.

802
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 I hope you do not hear that.

803
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I have said from this platform myself,

804
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 I pray that God gives you transcendent touches

805
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 here on Tuesday nights.

806
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Because that's what he'll do.

807
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Like you'll walk in this room and then one night,

808
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 it's just going to come.

809
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Like the roof is going to blow off the building for you.

810
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It's going to be like a Tuesday that you've never before seen.

811
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 It's going to be crazy.

812
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And yet you're going to come back on another Tuesday

813
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 and it's just going to feel like a Tuesday.

814
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Why? Because growth isn't always about the burning bush moment.

815
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 It's also about the mundane moments in between.

816
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Like Moses grew not just because he came face to face with God

817
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 at the bush, at the pillar of fire,

818
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 at the parting of the Red Sea.

819
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 No, he grew with God by way of wandering in the wilderness

820
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 for 40 years and learning to shepherd sheep.

821
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Some of you deeply want to grow.

822
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 The mundanity of your spirituality,

823
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 it can be richer, it can be hotter.

824
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 But don't let it discourage you.

825
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 God's working in the waiting.

826
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 He's working in the mundane.

827
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 He's wanting to meet with you at all times and in all ways.

828
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 How do you spot a spiritual fraud?

829
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 1 John 4, 1 through 3 tells us.

830
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit,

831
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 but test the spirits to see whether they are from God.

832
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 For many false prophets have gone out into the world.

833
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 By this you know the spirit of God.

834
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh

835
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 is from God."

836
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Catch that.

837
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Every spirit that confesses Jesus has come in the flesh

838
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 is from God.

839
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.

840
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 How do you tell if someone or something is spiritually fraudulent?

841
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 When the emphasis moves away from the simplicity of knowing Christ.

842
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 It's all about Him, man.

843
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And when the emphasis ever becomes about anything else,

844
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 you get as far away from that as possible.

845
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And this is the reality, man.

846
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 I fear in our desire and desperation to be connected to something that feels real.

847
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 That feels spiritual.

848
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 We have in fact gotten connected to things that do feel real and do feel spiritual.

849
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 But are not good.

850
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 We have given ourselves over to things that fall within the list I said earlier.

851
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 I said, you know what, I can have this crystal.

852
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 I can manifest this idea.

853
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 I can indulge these other spiritual curiosities and walk with Jesus.

854
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 No.

855
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Paul is decrying that reality.

856
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 If you want inclined spiritual experience,

857
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 why would you look anywhere else than the man that is the fullness of the deity?

858
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Like all the fullness of God dwells in Jesus.

859
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 If you want something transcendent, then get intimate with him.

860
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Because he will lead you to it.

861
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Final point.

862
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Pick it up in verse 20.

863
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why,

864
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?

865
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch.

866
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 That feels a lot like religion, right?

867
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

868
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Referring to things that all perish as they are used,

869
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 according to human precepts and teachings.

870
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion

871
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 and asceticism and severity of the body,

872
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.

873
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 As Paul moves into the final few verses of this chapter,

874
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 he picks up an idea that he addressed earlier on,

875
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 but we didn't really unpack in full detail.

876
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 He comes back to this idea of asceticism.

877
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Earlier I said that asceticism is the teaching that you spiritually attain

878
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 by way of self-denial.

879
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 And yet here's what's interesting.

880
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Like Paul is, he's going to talk about, yeah, you know,

881
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 like self-denial in this context is bad,

882
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 but self-denial in every context isn't always bad.

883
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Like if you look throughout the Bible,

884
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 there are multiple examples of ascetic practices, of self-denial,

885
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 things like fasting and abstinence and celibacy,

886
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 that people are, that people ultimately adopt

887
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 for the sake of growing closer to God.

888
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 You can look at the words of Jesus himself.

889
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 He says in Luke 9, 23, "And he said to all,

890
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 'If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself

891
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and take up his cross daily and follow me.'"

892
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Let him deny himself.

893
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Is self-denial intrinsically bad?

894
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Is asceticism inherently wrong?

895
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 No, it's not.

896
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 But here's the thing.

897
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 The act of self-denial is not intrinsically wrong,

898
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 but what can be wrong is the motive behind your self-denial.

899
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 That's what can be wrong.

900
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Which feels kind of like, yeah, man, of course.

901
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Like it's always about motives.

902
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 It's always about my heart.

903
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 But here's what we need to grab hold of,

904
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 because I think that this is where the point really stands out.

905
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 If you look at the word asceticism in the original language,

906
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 it's a weird word,

907
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 because the word actually just means humility,

908
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 which we hear, and we're like, "That's a really good thing, man.

909
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I'm supposed to be humble."

910
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 God gives favor to the humble.

911
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 He gives grace to them.

912
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And yet in this context, as you read through this,

913
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 through these verses,

914
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 what Paul's unpacking is not the idea of pure humility,

915
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 but impure humility.

916
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 He's unpacking this idea of false humility.

917
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 For the Colossians, asceticism is synonymous with false humility.

918
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 What's false humility?

919
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 False humility is pride in disguise.

920
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 It's pride in disguise.

921
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 I'm going to make myself look low.

922
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I'm going to sound like I don't know.

923
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 And yet in the process of doing these things,

924
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 they're going to think I'm awesome.

925
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 Like one of my friends, he was saying earlier,

926
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 it's as if Jordan walked in and said,

927
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 "Man, I'm no good at basketball."

928
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 It's like, "Shut up, Jordan.

929
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 You're amazing at basketball."

930
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 That would be false humility.

931
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 He would be saying something that is not true.

932
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Why? Because he's baiting compliments.

933
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 That's what Paul's pointing at here in this chapter.

934
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 He's saying, "Hey, you need to beware

935
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 of seeking an impressive appearance instead of Christ.

936
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 You need to beware of seeking an impressive appearance

937
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 instead of Christ."

938
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 When he says, "Hey, when you submit to regulations

939
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 that have the appearance of wisdom

940
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 and promoting self-made religion and asceticism

941
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 and severity to the body, they have no value."

942
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Like when you promote your own self-made godliness,

943
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 your false humility,

944
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 when you make yourself look low like Christ,

945
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 but simply so you can receive acclaim

946
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 and accolade and approval,

947
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 there's no value in that.

948
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 That has no worth whatsoever.

949
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Which, Porch, if I can just deal honestly with you

950
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 for a second, for those of you in the room

951
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 that do know Jesus,

952
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 this is a problem that is especially prevalent

953
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 in our culture today, because what we know

954
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 is that people have bought full-heartedly

955
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 into the commodification of Christ

956
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 and viral posturing for the sake of approval,

957
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 all on the basis of Jesus' name.

958
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 You see it.

959
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Just pull up Instagram right now.

960
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 You can see someone with lights, camera, action,

961
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 making sure that people look in and say,

962
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 "Golly, I wish I was godly like them."

963
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 And yet the truth of the matter is,

964
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 that's false humility, not in every sense,

965
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 but it certainly can be,

966
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 that people will prop themselves up

967
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 on the foundation of Jesus Christ's name,

968
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Jesus Christ's ministry,

969
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 simply for the hope that you will follow them

970
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 more so than you'll follow him.

971
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 I am begging you,

972
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 do not be a life that follows in that vein.

973
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 That's what Paul is drilling home.

974
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 He's saying, "Hey, don't aspire to look

975
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 "like your favorite Christian influencer."

976
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 You don't need to always speak in quotable captions

977
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 and strategic sound bites.

978
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 He says in 1 Timothy 6, 7,

979
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 "Ask for the rich in the present age."

980
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 The rich, those that have everything they want.

981
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 "Charge them not to be haughty,

982
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 "nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches,

983
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 "but on God who richly provides us

984
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 "with everything to enjoy."

985
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 It's not in riches, it's not in acclaim,

986
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 it's not through approval,

987
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 it's not by recognition that you enjoy, it's by God.

988
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 God is the source of all joy.

989
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 And listen, I know that feels especially specific

990
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 to the believer, but for the unbeliever here,

991
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 if you don't know Jesus,

992
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 if you're still trying to figure this all out,

993
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Paul is pleading with you too,

994
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 to not just stand on the right side of history

995
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 and agree to today's truth,

996
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 but to align with the author of all history

997
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 and follow his objective truth.

998
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 That's what Paul is arguing for your sake.

999
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 He's saying, "Hey man, God has everything you want and more,

1000
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 "everything you've longed for,

1001
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 "everything you've angled to get,

1002
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 "He's the one that has it, so you come to Him."

1003
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Paul, I'm sorry, Jesus says in the gospel of John,

1004
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 He says to the Jews who had believed in Him,

1005
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples

1006
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 "and you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free."

1007
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 You see the truth of Jesus Christ

1008
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 is the one that sets us free.

1009
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 Believer, non-believer, it's the one that sets us free.

1010
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Free from being enough for people,

1011
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 free from feeling the need to position myself

1012
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 or posture my life so people will look at it and say,

1013
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 "Hey, that looks awesome, man, how do I get like that?"

1014
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Free from any need to hold up the mask

1015
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 and hide behind it any longer,

1016
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 like Jesus is the one that sets you free from all of it.

1017
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 I just wish we would believe it.

1018
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 I wish we would believe the fact

1019
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 that He is the one that has come to set us free.

1020
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 Free from sin, yes.

1021
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Free from slavery and bondage of those things

1022
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 which we know we should not do yet we have done anyways

1023
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 and are in absolute and utter rebellion to God.

1024
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 He has come to free us from that,

1025
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 but He hasn't just come to free us from our sin,

1026
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 He has come to free us to new life,

1027
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 to a new future, to a new hope, to a new glory.

1028
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 How do we know that that's the case?

1029
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 How do we know that Jesus has set us free

1030
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 from anything that would threaten our identity in Him?

1031
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Because Jesus Christ,

1032
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 He did every moral activity you and I could not do.

1033
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 He was perfect in our place.

1034
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 He lived absolutely perfectly on your behalf.

1035
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 But not only that, Jesus Christ, the fullness of God,

1036
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 become man.

1037
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 He has brought in full a spiritual experience

1038
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 the likes of which you will find nowhere else.

1039
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 He says, "I know that you want for something deep

1040
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 "and meaningful and rich, and I've come to give it to you."

1041
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 But not only that, Jesus,

1042
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 He did not concern Himself with an impressive appearance.

1043
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Instead, He took on our likeness,

1044
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 humbled Himself by becoming like one of us

1045
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 for the very purpose of living, dying, rising,

1046
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 that you might have an appearance the likes of which

1047
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 you wouldn't dare dream find.

1048
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 One that is so impressive

1049
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 that the world will look upon and not say,

1050
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 "Man, you're awesome,"

1051
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 but will look to Him and say, "He is awesome."

1052
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 This is the gospel.

1053
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 Christ has come to set you free from every threat

1054
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 by enduring your threat

1055
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 that you might be with Him where He is forever.

1056
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Do you believe Him?

1057
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Do you know Him?

1058
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Then walk with Him, trust in Him,

1059
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 and He will make you like Himself in due time.

1060
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Let me pray for us.

1061
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 Father,

1062
00:45:50,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 God, there are so many

1063
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 traps and temptations in this world,

1064
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 so many things, God, which seek to

1065
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 dissuade us from walking with You,

1066
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 lead us to seek satisfaction elsewhere.

1067
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 And yet, God, tonight we're reminded of the reality that

1068
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 true love, deep joy,

1069
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 and uninhibited freedom

1070
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 is found in You and You alone.

1071
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 And because, God, this truth still remains true,

1072
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 and it reigns over us tonight by Your Son, Jesus Christ,

1073
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 we can take such courage in heart

1074
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 that though, God, in this world we will have trouble,

1075
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 we can take heart, for You have overcome it,

1076
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 and, God, we will be with You where You are one day.

1077
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Lord, I know that there are people in this room tonight

1078
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 that don't know You,

1079
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 and yet, God, they've walked in tonight,

1080
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 and they've asked questions

1081
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 that, God, I myself have asked in times past.

1082
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Why is life so hard?

1083
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 What's all this about?

1084
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 What even is my purpose?

1085
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 And I pray, God, they would know that

1086
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 You are the one that has the answers to these things,

1087
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 and those answers, God,

1088
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 they're better than they could ever imagine.

1089
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 For the believer in the room, God,

1090
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 there are many of us here that,

1091
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 man, we have fallen prey to some of the dangers

1092
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 we've talked about tonight, God.

1093
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 We have absolutely fallen prey to legalism,

1094
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 religious observance, God,

1095
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 just doing the right thing

1096
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 and hoping to get good out of it,

1097
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 trusting, God, that that's gonna make me like Jesus.

1098
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Lord, that's not gonna make us like Jesus.

1099
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 It's Jesus that makes us like Jesus.

1100
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 Sure, we gotta work out our salvation with fear and trembling.

1101
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 We've gotta come along and be a part of the process,

1102
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 but we can trust in You, God,

1103
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 to complete the work that You've already begun.

1104
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 Others of us, it's not moral activity.

1105
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 It's spiritual sensitivity, God.

1106
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 We want an experience.

1107
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 I pray, God, that we would know

1108
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 in You is all the fullness we could ever seek,

1109
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 that Jesus, You are the image of the invisible God,

1110
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 and so we need seek transcendence nowhere else but in You.

1111
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 For others, God, we feel this need to be impressive,

1112
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 to put up a front,

1113
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
 to make sure, God, that we impress and appeal to people,

1114
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 and yet, God, we can know

1115
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 that we don't need to pursue impressive appearance,

1116
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 for You, Jesus, have given us a likeness to that of Yourself.

1117
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 God, would You work amongst us?

1118
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 Would You have Your way in this space?

1119
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 Would You lead us to take the next step, we pray.

1120
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 It's in Jesus' holy name, amen.

1121
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 Amen.
