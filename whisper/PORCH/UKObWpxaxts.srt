1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 What is joy, buddy?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I don't know.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 It's a dream!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 [Music playing]

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 All right, Ports, how we doing?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 We doing okay?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Great to see you.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 So glad that you're here.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Genuinely, it always means so much that you would make time out of your very busy schedule to be here at the Porch with us.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Not just those of you in the room, but everyone tuning in online.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We love that God is not only meeting with young adults here, He is meeting with young adults everywhere.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Y'all know that, right?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 He is meeting with people your age, your peers, all over not only the nation, but the globe.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 We get to be a part of something so significant that He is doing.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And there are Porch Live locations all over the place as well.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Can we give it up for them real quick?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We haven't just put our hands together for what God is doing at all of our Porch Live locations.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We love the fact that we get to be a small part of what God is doing wherever it is you are.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Special shout out to Porch Live Indy, Fresno, and Dayton.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Well, several years ago, we went on the family cruise of the century.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You know, you fall into one of two buckets.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You're either cruise people or you're not cruise people.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Two of my cruise people in here.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I'm still on the fence.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I have not decided yet.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 So this was my attempt to really figure it out if I was in, if I was a part of the cruise train.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And so this was a massive, this was a massive event for my family.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Like we had booked it well in advance.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 We had been saving up.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 We wanted to make the money work.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 We made sure that everybody's calendars were aligned.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And at last, we set sail to the British Virgin Islands for a week's worth of rest and relaxation.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Don't you think that sounds amazing right now?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Anybody want to get out of here?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Just take a week off of work?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Amen.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Yeah, now as is true on any cruise, we made several stops along the way.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Because you pull up to different ports.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So that way you can see the sites and you can meet the people.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And so we knew there were a variety of islands we were going to.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 But one of the islands we were going to be making port at was the island of St. Martin.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I didn't know anything about St. Martin.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I had done no previous research.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But I assumed it was a beach destination.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And so I knew that somewhere amongst the sand of this island was going to be a chair and an umbrella with my name on it.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But I also knew that my brother-in-law was very excited about St. Martin.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Why was he excited about this island?

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Specific you may be asking yourself.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Not because of the vibrant culinary scene that is true of St. Martin.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Or the diverse cultural backdrop that marks this landscape.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Not the fact that this is a dream destination for deep sea divers.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 No, none of those reasons were the object of his desire for this island.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Instead, the reason he was so excited for St. Martin was because of a beach known as Mahal Beach.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Now you may not recognize the name Mahal Beach.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But you will recognize the pictures.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Because Mahal Beach is both on every aviation aficionado and TikTok influencers bucket list.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 The photos are amazing.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 If ever you're in the area, you should check it out.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 It is known as Airport Beach.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Mahal is one of the only places in the world where you can get your tan on.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 You can sip a pina colada.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And you can put your hand on the belly of a Boeing 747 as it lands right behind you.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It is truly one of a kind.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 There is nothing else like it in the world, at least that I know of.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, the day arrived and the beach was exactly as we expected.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It was packed.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It was loaded with guests all trying to do the exact same thing that we were.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 They were trying to snap a selfie while getting swept in the jet stream of whatever Airbus was careening overhead.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It was hilarious to watch people try and get in a position where they could take a good picture.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 They were losing their ever-loving minds.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 The adults, most of all.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 It was hilarious to watch people in the water, like, falling out of their floaties and trying to make it to the beach.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Because they could see a plane on the horizon.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Or grown men pulling up different flight information and tracking whatever the big international flights were that were coming in that area.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Or as these planes were flying overhead, whole adults just like raising their fists and cheering at the fact that this plane was so close.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It's right here. Here we go. Let's go.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Like, that was everyone's reaction as this was happening.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 It was the most ridiculous experience.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Grown men transporting back in time to their 10-year-old selves.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Because they found a reason to rejoice as they saw these planes coming in.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 But you know what stood out to me most?

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 If you went just 50 yards down the beach, either to the left or to the right, you would encounter a vibe that was very different altogether.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Because while in the center of the beach as these planes are flying overhead, everyone is celebrating and they're losing their minds.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And oh my gosh, like, that was huge. You see how close it got to us?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I almost touched it. No, you didn't. But I almost touched it.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Like, everyone is having the most amazing experience.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 But 50 yards left or right of it, the vibe is totally different.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Because while we're all celebrating in this spot, these people are just casually reading through their book.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Trying to get their tan on, lathering on some sunscreen.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Not to be bothered at all. They just want to be left alone.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 It was the oddest experience to see these people.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Like, they were clueless to the fact that one of mankind's greatest modern achievements, air travel, was literally happening right over us.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And they had the best seats in town for it.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But they just rather would not be bothered.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 They wanted to finish their drink, conclude their nap, or finish the chapter.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Why do I tell you that?

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Because in this world, God is regularly sending proverbial 747s over your life, nonstop and at all times.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 There is great reason to rejoice in this life.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And yet too often, we look like those that are sitting 50 yards to the left or 50 yards to the right.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Because we are too distracted, too busy, or too clueless to realize that this is the case.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Like, the jet stream of God's gigantic joy is washing people in its wake.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It is stirring people into celebration.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And yet we're just sitting to the side, not paying attention.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Disinterested, possibly.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 We've seen this before already.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 We've been there, done that.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And now we're just hoping for something a little bit more sensational or exciting that might capture my attention or entertain me more than this thing has.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 You see, put differently, many in our generation are unhappy.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And you don't have to look very far to realize that this is true.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Like, you don't have to look outside of these walls.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 In fact, you can look inside of yourself and you can see that there's probably a good chance you feel somewhat unhappy in life.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Because as I've visited with young adults, many of you included, what I've found is we prescribe to a lifestyle of joylessness.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 The likes of which none of us want to be true.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 If you look at the way we live, we're all aspiring to find deep sensation and satisfaction in life.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And yet, you know that some of you here, you feel like you don't belong amongst these people.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Like, you're falling behind your peers.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 You're stuck in your job.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 You want for a different career.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 You're romantically undesirable.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 You'll never amount to the dreams that you have.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 You're not able to break that addiction.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 You're overworked.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 You're underappreciated.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And you're unhappy because of it.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And this isn't just an us problem.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Like, just this year, a different study than the one I referenced last week, but similar in essence,

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 academic researchers Gene Twenge and David Blanchflower reported that young adults tallied the lowest life satisfaction and happiness scores among all adult age groups across six different countries.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Creating what they're calling a crisis in well-being among the young.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Blanchflower himself, he says that this may well be the next great global crisis.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 As they report, the rise in unhappiness does not actually originate from COVID.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Like many people believe, we love to prescribe all of our problems to what happened in 2020.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 No, this issue actually predates the global pandemic.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 It goes all the way back to 2013.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 You may be asking yourself, what happened in 2013?

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 The rise of smartphones and social media.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Now, to be clear, we can't assign all of our unhappiness in life or your dissatisfaction personally with technology or the rise of the digital age.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 That would be unfair, and that's not what tonight's talk is about.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But what I find interesting is that the rise in unhappiness originated the minute we started seeking joy through the experience of others rather than finding joy in our own experience.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 We have watched other people experience incredible happiness, and we have forgotten how to experience such happiness ourselves.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 We've lost the art of enjoyment, the title of tonight's talk.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 If that's you, then consider me, your fellow beachgoer, waving you back in from the left and the right flanks under the demonstration of God's joy and goodness and greatness and majesty and all cause worthy of rejoicing in, because God wants you to be delightful.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We're in our second week in a brand new series all about joy.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 If you haven't seen the artwork behind me, that's where we've been.

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It's second week. We've got a few more weeks ahead.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And what we talked about last week is that if you want to find joy, you have to first know what joy is.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Guys, have you ever been sent into Ulta to find something for your girl?

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Chances are you struggled a little bit when you were in that space.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I know that I have struggled in Ulta looking for whatever it is Brooke needs, because I have no idea what she's sending me in there for or what it is I'm looking for.

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And because I don't know what it is, I do not know where to find it.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 If you do not know what joy is, then you will not know where to find joy in this life, which is what's funny.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 We think we know what it is, but all of us are actually mistaken on the fact.

152
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 So many think we know, and so we're out there doing all manner of different things, coping and strategizing, sensationalizing,

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 because we're trying to fill that empty void, the happiness gap in our life.

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And yet we don't actually know what to look for to sustainably satisfy us for all time.

155
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So what is joy? Well, we defined it like this last week.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Joy is a lasting emotion that is not achieved in life, but received from God, who felt it first and feels it most.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And as I've thought back on that definition, a reflection of last week's talk, a sermon, a sentence, if you will, I think it's so true.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Joy is a lasting emotion that is not achieved in life, but it's received from God, like a gift, who felt it first and feels it most.

159
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Meaning that any true and lasting joy we experience has God as its essence.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I'll prove it to you like this. A little crowd participation, and we're going to do better than last week. I need you to speak up.

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 When have you felt happiest in life?

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 When I won a game.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 When you won a game. Okay.

164
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Say again.

165
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 No bills.

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 No bills. All right.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 When have you felt happiest in life?

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Think about it. Take a moment to yourself. Think about it.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 When have you genuinely felt happiest in life?

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 The holidays. I heard someone say holidays.

171
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Holding my newborn niece.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 The gift of new life. What else?

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Dancing. Yeah. Dancing. Yeah.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 The expression of joy itself.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Having a child. Being out in creation.

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 All right. You're good.

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 We'll try again next week.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 You see, here's the thing.

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 If you're serious about it, if you actually look through the halls of your history and you consider when you were happiest in life,

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 what you'll arrive at is likely not something material, but something meaningful instead.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And all meaning has that intrinsic quality of significance because it is by Jesus and for Jesus,

182
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 exactly like the Apostle Paul said in the book of Colossians.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 You see, we remember those happiest moments because they're rooted in something that matters.

184
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And the good news for us tonight is many of those things, as you honestly assess and you consider what that is,

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 it's not just lying in wait behind you.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It may in fact still be out ahead of you.

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Like it's not something that you experienced once and only once.

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It may be something that you can experience at some point in the future.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 It's a joy that you can find again.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 The question then is how do you find it?

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Well, that's the goal of tonight.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 The goal is how do we find joy?

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 That's what I want to help you with.

194
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We talked about what it is.

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I want to help you understand how you actually find it.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 That's tonight.

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And in the next couple of weeks, we'll do a little bit more work on that.

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Now, similar to last week, we're going to be all over the place scripturally,

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 but we're going to home base in the book of Philippians.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 So if you have a Bible, you can turn with me to the book of Philippians.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Why Philippians?

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Philippians, according to church tradition, is known as the epistle of joy.

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Epistle is another word for letter.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It's a letter from Paul.

205
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And all throughout its pages, you see the words joy and gladness

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 and rejoicing more so in the concentrated span of its few chapters

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 than anywhere else in the Bible.

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 It is characteristically thematically defined by joy.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And yet what's interesting is Paul is in the most joyless of circumstances.

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You see, he is imprisoned in Rome at the time that he is writing to the church

211
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 at Philippi.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And so it makes him a really good authority on the topic of joy

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 because Paul knows that joy does not depend on one state of being,

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 but on one state of belief.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 As John Mark Homer said it, it depends less,

216
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 joy depends less on the emotions of the heart

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 and more on the condition of the heart.

218
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 A condition that Paul is really well acquainted with

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 and a condition that he wants us to embody ourselves.

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And a condition that we're going to see is defined by three things in specific.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 So here we go.

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Philippians chapter one.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It says this.

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We'll pick it up in verse three.

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 I thank God in all my remembrance of you,

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 always in every prayer of mine,

227
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 for you all making my prayer with joy.

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Now that's a really big statement.

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 In every prayer of Paul's, he's making prayers with joy.

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 So it begs the question, what's the prayer, Paul?

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Like if every prayer you're praying is leading you to be joyful,

232
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 then what is it that is actually,

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 what's actually stirring up your joy for these believers?

234
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Well, verse nine tells us,

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 and it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 with knowledge and all discernment,

237
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 so that you may approve what is excellent.

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And this is the ultimate outcome of prayer.

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,

240
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 filled with the fruit of righteousness

241
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.

242
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 So what's Paul saying right here?

243
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Well, he's saying a lot, right?

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Paul is the master of saying as much as possible

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 and as few words as possible.

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And yet if we could push through all the verbal flourishing

247
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 and we could boil this thing down to its most rudimentary summary statement,

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 what we know is that Paul is simply praying these believers,

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 as well as you and I, would live with purity and innocence in the world.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 That's what he's asking God for.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 I don't know what you pray to God for

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 whenever you're asking him to do something in your life.

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Paul is praying for your purity and your innocence.

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That's what he cares most about.

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 He wants us to be a people that think and look and judge,

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 not like the world, but like God himself.

257
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 He actually even doubles down on the idea

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 whenever you get to the end of his letter.

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 You turn to Philippians chapter 4, and it says this in verses 8 and 9.

260
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 He says, "Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,

262
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 whatever is commendable, if there's any excellence,

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 if there's anything worthy of praise, think about these things.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 What you've learned and received and heard and seen in me,

265
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 me as the example, practice these things

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and the God of peace will be with you."

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Paul is looking at the Philippians and he's saying,

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 "Hey, I want you to be like me.

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I want you to be like me in that I am full of joy."

270
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Like Paul is way better at joy than any of us,

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 despite the fact that he's lived through things,

272
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 the likes of which you and I will probably never know.

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 The guy is riddled with a holy happiness

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 that is from heaven on high.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And he's looking at the Philippians and you and saying,

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 "Hey, I want you to be like me.

277
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I want you to have this indomitable joy, this heavenly happiness."

278
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And the way he advises us to do it is by shifting our perspective.

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 You see, joy sees through the eyes of innocence.

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 That's the first point tonight.

281
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Joy sees through the eyes of innocence.

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Like Peter Pan was the one who famously said,

283
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 "Just think happy thoughts and you'll fly."

284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And the irony is, is that old Peter wasn't far off.

285
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Like to be abundantly clear,

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 we're not talking about the idea of the power of positive thinking

287
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 or the law of attraction,

288
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 that if I think something as best for myself,

289
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 then I will attract that something that is best for myself to me, myself.

290
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 That's not what I'm talking about.

291
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I'm not talking about manifestation as we've modernly described it.

292
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 That is actually incongruent with the Bible.

293
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 It's actually refuted by the Bible.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 That is not a true concept in the slightest.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And yet, what we know is that your thoughts do have power,

296
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 not to change your circumstances,

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 but to transcend your circumstances through a perspective of innocence.

298
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 You see, we should see the world in such a way

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 that relishes the goodness and the beauty

300
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 and the truth of God that is on display.

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And yet, what we know is our world does not support that idea in the slightest.

302
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You don't have to look very far to figure it out.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 You turn on the TV, you watch the news, you read the critics,

304
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 you look through the comments,

305
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 and you'll realize our world does not delight in the things

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 that Paul described in Philippians 4.

307
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Instead, what the world delights in is that which is untrue and dishonorable

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 and unjust and impure and unlovely and disgraceful and disappointing

309
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 and unpraiseworthy.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Why does the world delight in these things?

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Because the world has bought into this crazy idea

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 that you have to lose your innocence to become wise.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And yet, what we know is that's the exact same lie

314
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 the serpent was saying in the Garden of Eden in Genesis chapter 3.

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 He looked on the two most innocent people in creation,

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 and he simply told them,

317
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "Wait, doesn't that fruit look desirable to the eyes?

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And isn't it also useful to make you wise?"

319
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 You see, this was the lie from the very beginning,

320
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and it's the lie that our world is perpetrating today.

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be open.

322
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And yet, what we've learned is that it did not replace their innocence with wisdom.

323
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 All it did was replace their innocence with guilt.

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Some of us can relate to that.

325
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 We've bought whatever the world is selling,

326
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and what we feel instead of wisdom and life and fullness

327
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 is we feel guilty.

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 We feel ashamed.

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Our heads hang low. We hope nobody's watching.

330
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 We delete our browser history

331
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 because we don't want to actually own up to the things that we've done

332
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 in believing the world was telling us the truth.

333
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 The world overpromises and underdelivers constantly.

334
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And so what we have to do is we have to stop listening to the world,

335
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and we have to start listening to God.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And what Jesus is saying here by way of his spirit in the Apostle Paul

337
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 is he's saying, "Hey, you have to teach yourself to see things differently."

338
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 As Jesus would put it himself,

339
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 we have to teach ourselves to see things the same way little children do,

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 which is interesting.

341
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Have you ever wondered to yourself, "Why was Jesus so interested in little kids?"

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 They were the most inconvenient and insignificant of their day.

343
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Why was he so welcoming and hospitable and inviting to these little kids?

344
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Because he knows something about them that we need to know ourselves.

345
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 He talks about it in Matthew 18. He says this,

346
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 "At that time, the disciples came to Jesus saying,

347
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 'Hey, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'"

348
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 And here's what he did.

349
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 "Calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them,

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and he said, 'Truly I say to you, unless you turn'"

351
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 That word is actually often used for repentance.

352
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 "If you turn and become like children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven.

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You see, Jesus welcomed children because of their humility.

355
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Their humility, like that attitude which expects nothing,

356
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 but it appreciates everything.

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Like just as a child depends on another for life,

358
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 so too should we depend on God for our life.

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 But it's not just that a child depends on another for life.

360
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 It's also that children delight with one another in life.

361
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 We should be similar.

362
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 We should look just like kids into the world for all reasons to rejoice.

363
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And the beauty of children is it doesn't take them much

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 to actually find reason to have fun,

365
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 to actually gain good cause for celebration,

366
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 to actually identify a plausible excuse for play.

367
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I remember reading a part of Lonnie Johnson's story.

368
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Lonnie was a scientist with the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 during the historic Galileo mission.

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 He was working on a new jet pump design at home one day

371
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 when he accidentally shot a stream of water across his bathroom.

372
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Thinking he might be onto something special,

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 but wanting to test the marketability of his mistake,

374
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 he eventually built his seven-year-old daughter a prototype jet pump.

375
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And he gave it to her, and he told her to take it

376
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 and show it to her friends and see what they said.

377
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 What he learned is that he had the most fortuitous accident

378
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 because the super soaker was born.

379
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 He was able to design one of the top 20 most widely known

380
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 and broadly sold toys in American history

381
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 because he handed it to a kid.

382
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And he asked her to test its marketability,

383
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 to figure out if it actually was worthy of rejoicing in.

384
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You see, there's a lot we can learn from little kids.

385
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 G.K. Chesterton says it like this,

386
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 "Because children have abounding vitality,

387
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 because they are in spirit fierce and free,

388
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 therefore they want things repeated and unchanged.

389
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 They always say, 'Do it again!'

390
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead."

391
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 For grown-up people are not strong enough to exult in monotony,

392
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 but perhaps God is strong enough to exult in monotony.

393
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It is possible that God says every morning,

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 "Do it again" to the sun,

395
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 and every evening, "Do it again" to the moon.

396
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It may not be the automatic necessity that makes all daisies alike.

397
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 It may be that God makes every daisy separately

398
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 but has never got tired of making them.

399
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It may be that he has the eternal appetite of infancy.

400
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 For we have sinned and grown old,

401
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and our Father is younger than we."

402
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 You see, joy sees the world through the eyes of innocence.

403
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But let me be clear,

404
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 not with a childish faith,

405
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 but a childlike faith.

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 There's a big difference in those two ideas.

407
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Paul's instruction is not that we would not be

408
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 full of knowledge and understanding.

409
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 He actually says quite the opposite in chapter 1.

410
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 No, we should be well-informed,

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 and yet we should receive that information with delight.

412
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 It should lead us to engage the world

413
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 in the way that it was meant to be engaged,

414
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 with the kind of delight that doesn't just rejoice

415
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 when a sunset catches you off unexpectedly,

416
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 or when a long-lost friend calls you because they want to reconcile,

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 or because the opportunity of a lifetime has come for you to travel across the world.

418
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 That's not the only moment when we're meant to engage with joy.

419
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Yes, those moments come.

420
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 They are quite significant, and we should certainly rejoice in them.

421
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And yet what we know from children is they don't need significance.

422
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 They need insignificance to rejoice in.

423
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 We know that children, as the example here,

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 those that are most characteristically innocent,

425
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 they find beauty and goodness and truth and splendor

426
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 where it's most frequently found in simplicity.

427
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 You don't have to wait until you take that trip to Cabo to find joy,

428
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 because joy is waiting for you tonight.

429
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It isn't rooted in what you experience in life.

430
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 It is rooted in how you experience life.

431
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 That's the first point.

432
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Paul wants us to develop an instinct for innocence.

433
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 We need to move very quickly.

434
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So here we go.

435
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Chapter 2. Paul keeps going.

436
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 He says this in verse 14.

437
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 "Do all things without grumbling or disputing,

438
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 that you may be blameless and innocent."

439
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 There's that language again.

440
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 "Children of God, without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation,"

441
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 which is the opposite of innocence, is it not?

442
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 "Among whom you shine as lights in the world,

443
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 holding fast to the word of light,

444
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 so that in the day of Christ I may be proud

445
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering

447
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 upon the sacrificial offering of your faith,

448
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I am glad and I rejoice with you all.

449
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Likewise, you also should be glad and rejoice with me."

450
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 What is the source of Paul's joy right here?

451
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 It's the confidence in what they do in life.

452
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 He started off by saying, "Hey, my joy is rooted in your innocence,"

453
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 but now he continues and he says, "My joy is found in your obedience."

454
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Which if I had to guess, catches some of us off guard

455
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 and leaves some of us slightly annoyed

456
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 because this is so typical of religion.

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Of course, this is what he would say.

458
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He would want us to do this to get that.

459
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It's the spiritual vending machine.

460
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I drop in X and I get out Y.

461
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 But listen, that is not the heart of the gospel.

462
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Jesus is not interested in a transactional relationship with you.

463
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He doesn't want a quid pro quo type of arrangement

464
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 where, "Hey, I'll give you this if you give me that."

465
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 That's not his heart in the slightest.

466
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You see, God, and this is so important,

467
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 he does not command of you because he is trying to make you good.

468
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 God commands of you because he is inviting you into his goodness.

469
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 That is huge.

470
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 He's not trying to just make you good.

471
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 He is trying to bring you into his goodness.

472
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Like every command and every statute and every instruction

473
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 and all of the rules, he's saying,

474
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 "Hey, this is the way to joy.

475
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Like this is the path to life.

476
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 This is what's going to lead you into the sort of vibrant vitality

477
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 that you want to be true of your existence."

478
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But we don't think about obedience like that.

479
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 We divorce obedience from goodness.

480
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And yet what we have to know is that joy never graduates from goodness.

481
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 It never graduates from goodness.

482
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 It never moves on.

483
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Nothing in life will be genuinely joyful if it is not genuinely good,

484
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 which means that if you're trying to live the Christian life

485
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 and do the Christian things and it's not good,

486
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 it doesn't feel right, you're probably doing it wrong.

487
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Now, that's not an indictment on you to be like,

488
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 "Hey, man, you've messed up."

489
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 No, it should just be a red alert, a flag in your mind,

490
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 a check engine on your heart that,

491
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "Hey, I should probably do some investigation.

492
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Probably should pop the hood and do some inspection.

493
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I need to figure out why isn't my obedience leading to my joy?

494
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Why doesn't obedience actually feel good?"

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 You see, everything God does, everything God speaks,

496
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 everything God is, all of it is good.

497
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 We just have to remind ourselves that that's true.

498
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Psalm 119 says it so well.

499
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 It says, "Blessed or happy are you, O Lord."

500
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 So teach me your statutes with my lips.

501
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 I declare all the rules of your mouth

502
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 in the way of your testimonies.

503
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 I delight, that's joy language, as much as in all riches.

504
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 I will meditate on your precepts

505
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and I will fix my eyes on your ways.

506
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I will delight in your statutes.

507
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I will not forget your word.

508
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Why? Because God's word and the commands it gives

509
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 not only makes you good, it leads you to goodness.

510
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And there in goodness is joy actually found.

511
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And yet so many of us have divorced the obedience God asks

512
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 from the goodness that God offers.

513
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Like we know, shouldn't sleep around.

514
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And yet we fail to realize that God,

515
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 he is trying to secure your dignity.

516
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 He's trying to preserve so special an intimacy

517
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 between you and your partner one day.

518
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Well, I know I'm not supposed to tell lies,

519
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 but listen, God isn't just telling you not to tell lies.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 He's trying to give you a clean conscience.

521
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 He's trying to let you move through life

522
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 with a guilt-free existence.

523
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 He doesn't want you to be fearful of breaking trust

524
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 in the relationships that matter in your life.

525
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Well, I know that he says I shouldn't serve money,

526
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 but listen, God doesn't want you to fall prey

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 to the enslavement of materialism.

528
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 He doesn't want you to live your life

529
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 keeping up with what the Joneses,

530
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 or just making sure you have an approvable appearance.

531
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 That's not what he wants for you.

532
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 He's trying to give you something better.

533
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Well, I know that he says that I shouldn't worry

534
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 what people think.

535
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Exactly.

536
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 He wants you to remember what he thinks

537
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 because everyone's opinion about you

538
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 is going to change over the course of time,

539
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 but his opinion about you is never ever going to change.

540
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 He has declared what he thinks of you

541
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 by way of Christ on the cross.

542
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 So don't worry about what others think.

543
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Worry what he does.

544
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I could go on, but here's the point.

545
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 So many of us, we are focusing on what God wants from us

546
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 as opposed to what God wants for us.

547
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 We look at obedience as you're trying to hold out on me, God.

548
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 He's like, no, I know better than you.

549
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 I'm not holding out on you.

550
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I'm trying to get you over to this thing instead.

551
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 It's so much better over here.

552
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 This is where life and joy and meaning and purpose

553
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 and fullness is found.

554
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And yet we love to take time

555
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 in delight, in trite, empty pleasantries.

556
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 God wants you to be joyful.

557
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 So he is asking you to do good

558
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 because when you do good, you actually feel happy.

559
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 That's not some mind-blowing realization.

560
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And yet I don't know that you may have ever put it into words.

561
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 This is really practical in life.

562
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 When you do good, you feel happy about it.

563
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 When you go to the gym, you feel pretty good that you did that.

564
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 When you ate healthy, you're like, you know what?

565
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Yeah, man, I can actually do this thing.

566
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 When you went to sleep early, you're like, you know what?

567
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 I am an adult.

568
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 When you started reading those books,

569
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 I'm on the fast track to being a Renaissance man.

570
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 You see the effect of doing good

571
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 is that joy brings the good it offers in your life,

572
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 in the practical things, but especially in the spiritual things.

573
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Like you avoid porn, and that feels like a major win.

574
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 You did it.

575
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 You made it all the way through.

576
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Like you actually confess your sins

577
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 and it feels like a weight is lifted off of you.

578
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Like you pray to God

579
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and you can feel your anxiety abate a bit.

580
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Like you actually choose to slow down, turn off your phone,

581
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 go for a walk and take the day as God gives

582
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 and you find peace in it.

583
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 If you will just do good,

584
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 you will actually just be happy.

585
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 It's not rocket science.

586
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 There's no better example of this,

587
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 of rediscovering the goodness of obedience,

588
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 than this character I was introduced to

589
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 over the course of my study through G.K. Chesterton's book, "Man Alive."

590
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 The name of the character is Innocent Smith.

591
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Innocent Smith in the story is an enigmatic figure

592
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 that comes to a boarding house

593
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 occupied by, when you have it, a group of young adults.

594
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Though at first, Smith strikes the other tenants as odd

595
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 and childlike with his behavior,

596
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 they eventually begin to learn, by way of observation,

597
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 the fundamental truth with which guide

598
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Innocent Smith's life completely.

599
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 You see, they realize he's not just happy,

600
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 he's not just foolhardy, he's not just a lover of life.

601
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 It's that Innocent Smith is actually genuinely happy.

602
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 He's not putting on a front.

603
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 He's legitimately this way.

604
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 And what they realize is that throughout the book,

605
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Innocent Smith continues to re-engineer ways

606
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 to observe God's commands and find the goodness therein.

607
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 So what we know is that in the story,

608
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 he would break into his own home

609
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 so that he would learn his goods are worthy of covenanting,

610
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 not someone else's.

611
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 He would actually propose and re-propose to his wife

612
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 because he wanted to be reminded of the romantic interest

613
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 that she actually is in his life.

614
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 He hitchhiked across the world, trekked across the globe

615
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 because he wanted to be reminded of the value

616
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 that's found in his home and being there with his family.

617
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You see, Innocent never graduates from goodness.

618
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 He certainly trains himself to recognize it.

619
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And by his example, we should train ourselves similarly.

620
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Friends, we have to train our passions, not just follow them.

621
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Oof, right?

622
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 What if you actually trained your passions

623
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 and you didn't just follow them around?

624
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 The modern world wants you to believe that happiness and joy

625
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 are found outside of Christ's claims,

626
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 that they are beyond the monotony of morality,

627
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 that it's in the pursuit of pleasure that you'll find fullness of joy.

628
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Yet what we know is that true joy and gladness

629
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 is found in directing our passions to loving good things.

630
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Obedience, it's not meant to feel like a grind.

631
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 It's meant to feel like a gift,

632
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 that if you would receive it, it would actually lead you to joy.

633
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Last one, chapter four, verse four.

634
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Paul says, "Rejoice in the Lord always.

635
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 "Again, I will say, rejoice.

636
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 "Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.

637
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 "The Lord is at hand.

638
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything,

639
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 "by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving," keyword,

640
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 "let your requests be made known to God.

641
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

642
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 "will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."

643
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Now, Paul concludes his letter with one final charge to joy,

644
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 and I think he appropriately ends in so good a spot,

645
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 because joy is so much more than empty optimism or positive platitudes.

646
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 What Paul is pointing to is what many of us need to be reminded of tonight,

647
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 that joy is persistent,

648
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 because some of you, I'm not too naive to know,

649
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 have heard the way I've talked about joy and celebration

650
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and goodness and gladness, and you have just wondered,

651
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 "Yeah, man, that feels like the case for everybody else.

652
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 "That's a possibility for all my peers in this room."

653
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 But you don't know my story, what I'm going through at current.

654
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 You don't know the sadness and the sorrow and the suffering

655
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 that is more synonymous with my life

656
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 than the attributes of joy you continue to describe.

657
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 And you're right, I don't.

658
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 But I think where he ends is so important,

659
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 if that's your situation, because he wants you to know

660
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 joy is found through innocence, it is found through obedience,

661
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 but it is also found through persistence.

662
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's found through persistence.

663
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Here's what I would say to you if that's your story,

664
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 if joy feels like a fantasy too far to find,

665
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 what you need to know is that we're going to spend an entire night

666
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 talking about joy and suffering and helping you realize

667
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 how it's actually possible even in your situation.

668
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 But for the rest of us here, what we need to know

669
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 is that joy needs to be frequently cultivated.

670
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 That's the idea. It has to be frequently cultivated.

671
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And according to Paul, in these few verses,

672
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 is it has to be done so with thanksgiving.

673
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Thanksgiving. Because joy makes a discipline of celebration.

674
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 That's the last point. Joy makes a discipline of celebration.

675
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 It's a discipline, meaning it has regular rhythm.

676
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 We should adopt habits of happiness that lead us to a place

677
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 where we're not just trying to find joy,

678
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 but we're actually training ourselves to find joy.

679
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 You get the difference in those two things, right?

680
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Trying is lackadaisical, it's casual, it's semi-indifferent.

681
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 You care, but not enough to actually get a plan together.

682
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 But training for something shows that you actually want it.

683
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Like you're willing to do whatever it takes to get it.

684
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Man, I should drop some weight. I'm going to try to do that.

685
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 You're probably not going to do that.

686
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 But if you train to do it, you're going to do it.

687
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Because you're going to get a plan in place.

688
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 You're going to get some discipline around your life.

689
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 You're going to sacrifice what you want most.

690
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Are you going to sacrifice what you want now for what you want most?

691
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 If you want joy most,

692
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 then you've got to build some discipline into your life.

693
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 One person said, "It's not joy that makes us grateful.

694
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 It's gratitude that makes us joyful."

695
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 It's not joy that makes us grateful.

696
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 It's gratitude that makes us joyful.

697
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 And listen, the science backs all of this up.

698
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 I could give you all of the myriad of health benefits that come

699
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 if you would pursue gratitude.

700
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 You just have to take my word for it.

701
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 It is extensive.

702
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 So let me just get to the how.

703
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 How do we actually do this?

704
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 How do we adopt a discipline of gratitude in our life?

705
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 I'll just give you a few examples, but we can go well beyond this.

706
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 And all of these examples are straight from the scripture.

707
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 You can meet with friends.

708
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Proverbs 27, 9 tells us that friendship has the power to refresh our souls.

709
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Look at your friend and say, "Man, you have the power to refresh my soul."

710
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 You know, like, that's what's available sitting right next to you.

711
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 Have you ever thought about a thing like that?

712
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Probably not, but that's actually what's available.

713
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 You can actually be refreshed through good friendship.

714
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Maybe you need to go for a hike.

715
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Jesus, he went on hikes regularly.

716
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 That's Luke 6, 12.

717
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Maybe you need to host a meal at home.

718
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Like, the early disciples, they broke bread in their homes.

719
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And the scripture tells us it was with glad and sincere hearts.

720
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Maybe you need to invite people over to your home, and you need to break bread together.

721
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Maybe you need to celebrate good news.

722
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Like, at the dedication of the wall in Jeremiah 12, 43, I love this.

723
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 It says, "The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away by the nations that surround."

724
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Like, is the celebratory nature of your life one where people are actually hearing it?

725
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 They're taking notice?

726
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Because that's what was happening, according to the goodness of God, in the people of Israel's life, according to Nehemiah.

727
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Maybe it's dancing. Someone said that.

728
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 David was so thrilled the ark had come back to Israel that he danced with all his might before the Lord.

729
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 I have never danced with all my might.

730
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 That would be a sight to behold, and one which you will not.

731
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 And yet, we should do it!

732
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Like, we should be willing to undignify ourselves in the spirit of rejoicing at God and who he is.

733
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 He's so good, we should.

734
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Laughter. Like, it's one of the best witnesses to God's goodness that you can give.

735
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Psalm 126, 2 says, "Our mouths were filled with laughter and our tongue with shouts of joy."

736
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them."

737
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Your laughter could be the best witness you give to people around you.

738
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Like, Christian, are you listening to me?

739
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Like, the joy you express could cause people to wonder, "What do they know that I don't?"

740
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 "Why are they so happy and I'm not?"

741
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 "Why is it that when the whole bottom falls out and hell and high water come, they don't give ground at all?"

742
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 They're always indomitably joyful.

743
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Your laughter has the power to do that.

744
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Maybe it's storytelling, sitting around and recounting the goodness of God.

745
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Like, all throughout the Gospels, Jesus told parables and stories that he might engage the minds of people

746
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 and transform their hearts as they leaned in further to listen.

747
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Maybe it's taking Sabbath, just a regular, repeated, rhythmic break in your schedule

748
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 where you don't work, you only play, and you remember that God loves you.

749
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 There are so many ways to regularly and rhythmically celebrate what God has done

750
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 and cultivate a heart of joy for Jesus.

751
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 The issue is not that we lack the ways to do this, it's that we lack the will to do this.

752
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 We lack the will.

753
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 The irony of this all is that joy is so worthy of wanting.

754
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Don't you want it?

755
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Then why don't we get serious about seeking it?

756
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Joy is not only worthy of wanting, it's desirable, even to the point of discipline.

757
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 So let's master ourselves that we might attain that which is most meaningful.

758
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Jesus has come to give you joy.

759
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 If you're here and you've lost the art of enjoyment, he has come to give it back to you.

760
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 What we know is that before you can ever lose something, you have to receive something.

761
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Jesus has come to give you joy.

762
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 What we know from the scripture is that he came seeing through the eyes of innocence.

763
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 He wasn't blind to our sin, he wasn't asleep to our shame,

764
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 but remembered how sweet it would be if we had a life with God

765
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 and all the goodness he has to give.

766
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Jesus never graduated from goodness.

767
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Instead, he sacrificed his own goodness for our sake.

768
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 He gave himself up on the cross, enduring all the cost of our godlessness

769
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 and giving back to us instead all of his godliness.

770
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 And Jesus has given us reason to celebrate because though he died and lay dead three days,

771
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 he rose forth from the grave.

772
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 That's a reason to rejoice.

773
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 And it's not a simple one.

774
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 It's so significant.

775
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 For in Christ's resurrection hang all the hope of humanity.

776
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 They would only place their faith in him.

777
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 You want joy?

778
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 Joy wants you.

779
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 Joy came for you.

780
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Receive him tonight.

781
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Let me pray for us.

782
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 God, thank you for this evening.

783
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Thank you for the people here, the work you're doing.

784
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 I pray that, God, they would all know you are individually working in their lives

785
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 across a full spectrum of spirituality.

786
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Maybe they don't know you, God.

787
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 They should know that you're working in their life.

788
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 It is not happenstance that they're here tonight.

789
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 They're here because you govern all things and you have decided for them to be here.

790
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 Maybe they're the firmest in belief, yet, God, they even can experience deeper delight.

791
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 Would we all know, God, that you want to work in our lives, move through our stories,

792
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 and lead us into life eternal?

793
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 We may have sorrow today, weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes in the morning.

794
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 Joy will come forever and always.

795
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 There will be a day when our sorrow and our sadness and our suffering ends,

796
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 but all eternity, it'll be bliss because it'll be with you.

797
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 We love you.

798
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 It's in Christ's name, amen.
