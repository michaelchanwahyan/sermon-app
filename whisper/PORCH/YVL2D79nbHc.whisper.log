[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:29.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   Well, hey, hey, Porch.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.200]   How we doing?
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.760]   All right, we're going to sync up real quick.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.440]   Hello, Houston.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.280]   Hello, Fort Worth.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.040]   Hello, downtown Dallas.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   Hello, South Africa.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.680]   How about that?
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.840]   Hello, folks in Joplin, Chicago, folks
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.160]   watching all kinds of places.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.480]   It is good to be together.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.440]   We're going to dive in.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   We are in the middle of a series called Anno Domini, OK?
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.580]   The Year of Our Lord.
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.480]   We're talking about stuff that happened in the time
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.600]   that our Lord walked on the face of the earth.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   AD, what was going on then?
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.000]   And I wanted to start by asking, what is going on now?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.640]   Because I don't know if you're like me.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.600]   You've probably been confronted by folks who are just saying,
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.360]   man, what is happening in our world?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.720]   What has happened to our world?
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.120]   This place has gone crazy.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.440]   The international leader of the Chilean Chief Police Union
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.680]   said there's never been a more dangerous time
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.600]   to be a police officer in America.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.000]   Another officer was shot today in Kansas.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.720]   Three we know were shot and killed on Sunday.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.320]   My friend was killed two weeks ago coming up this Thursday
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.680]   here in Dallas along with four other officers.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.960]   It's gone flat crazy in the way that this world has
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.600]   fallen apart.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.800]   And when it starts to happen like this around us,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.560]   near to us--
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.280]   and some of you that are closer to us
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.080]   than others in the Texas region are feeling it more than maybe
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.240]   people who are far from it.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.600]   How about the folks in Nice, France?
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.800]   How about the folks in Paris?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.160]   How about the folks in Orlando?
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.760]   What in the world has been going on in Turkey?
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.160]   I mean, you could go on and on and on.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.680]   We don't have to look very far back.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.880]   And we get to say, man, this world has gone crazy.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.440]   And what's really crazy is that some of us
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.560]   believe that God is sovereign, he's in control,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.640]   and he's good.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.120]   And yet we look, and it doesn't look
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.720]   like a good and loving and powerful God is in charge
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.040]   of what's happening around here.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.080]   It looks like the snake is loose, right?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.000]   I mean, none of us like snakes.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.320]   The Bible talks about how evil came into the world
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.600]   specifically through the personification of a snake.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.240]   And we know that ever since then, and probably
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.760]   from that moment before even, snakes were not something
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.600]   you kind of looked at and go, oh, I
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.220]   want to cuddle with that thing, right?
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.920]   You all like to cuddle with snakes?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.720]   Some people play with them, all right, and they're flat crazy.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.680]   But most of us run from them.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   My wife and I were watching TV, the news, I don't know,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.840]   it was five, six years ago.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   And there was a guy in Dallas that collected exotic snakes,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.000]   and specifically poisonous ones.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.520]   And he had a cobra.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.960]   And this king cobra got out of whatever
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.640]   he kept it in, some case, some aquarium.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.640]   And it was loose.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.200]   And so after he couldn't find it for a day or so,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.040]   he finally called the police and said, hey, just so you know,
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.640]   I don't know where my king cobra is.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.180]   And they're like, first of all, what are you doing with a king
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.280]   cobra, right, which you weren't supposed to have in the Dallas
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.800]   city limits.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.520]   But he said, I don't know where it is,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.840]   and I don't want anybody to get hurt.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   And so they came out to his house, they swept this house,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.000]   they looked in his house.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.300]   Neighbors came by and started to say, what's going on?
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.480]   And then they made their way down the block.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.020]   And they got to one of his neighbors,
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.900]   and they knocked on the door.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.200]   The news media was out front.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.820]   And the animal control knocked on her door.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.720]   And they said, ma'am, we need to get in and look in your house.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.640]   She goes, why do you need to look at my house?
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.180]   And they go, well, because your neighbor a couple doors down
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.360]   had a king cobra.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.320]   It got out of his cage, and we're not really--
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.640]   she goes, what?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.600]   Now, the way I'm going to speak might tell you
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.160]   that this person was a person of a certain ethnicity.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.440]   And so it didn't really matter what ethnicity they were,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.120]   all right?
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.160]   But she said, what?
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.000]   There's a king cobra in my house?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.280]   And right then, she bolted, all right?
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.680]   She ran out her front yard, down the sidewalk, jumped in her car,
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.840]   and locked the door.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.400]   The news cameras followed her.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.560]   We were watching this thing.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.000]   The news cameras followed her.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.480]   They went to her car, and they walked up,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.880]   and they're knocking on the door.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.480]   A woman's trying to interview her,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.400]   and she cracks the window about this much.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.860]   She goes, what do you want with me?
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.920]   And they go, ma'am, we want to know.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.200]   She goes, you just tell that snake
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.280]   he can have that house.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   I deed the house to the snake and rolled the window back up.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.560]   We cracked up.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.600]   And I was like, OK, I can relate to that, right?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   You got a king cobra potentially in your house.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.040]   You're like, I now give that snake-- that king cobra
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.960]   is king of my house until you kill it,
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.040]   until it's an insurrection.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.500]   Somebody tells me that king's dead.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.400]   I'll come back and reclaim my property.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   You might be feeling a little bit like this.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.120]   It looks like the snake has come into my house,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.200]   and things are not going as I want them to go.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.240]   And I want to check out.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.920]   Well, I'm here to tell you that the king of kings,
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.760]   if you've been tracking with us, the one who
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.880]   is stronger than the strong man, which
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.160]   is a biblical picture of the enemy, who
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.520]   is stronger than us in our flesh, the king of kings
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.600]   has told us that we should take heart
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.280]   and that we should not be surprised
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.800]   that the snake is at work.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.440]   And he's going to have some days when
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.640]   it looks like he is the king.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.240]   But he's not the king.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.120]   Our king, the year of the Lord king, is still reigning.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.800]   And he tells you to not be overcome, but to take courage.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.520]   And what I want to do tonight is show you
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.560]   how that can be true of you.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   A number of years ago, as I was talking like this,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.720]   a friend of mine who is one of those creative artists
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   that JP talked about us wanting to partner with in some things
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.800]   took some time, though, just to acknowledge the dichotomy that
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.680]   is out there, that there is a king of kings, Lord of lords,
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.520]   who is good and sovereign and powerful and true,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.400]   loving and kind.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   And yet, we live in a world defined by chaos.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.600]   And he made this video.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.320]   Well, I'm going to make a case he does.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.360]   Those of you guys that are watching
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   and want to catch that lady, you can go to ignitermedia.org
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.600]   and you can Google chaos.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   That'll show up.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.560]   That doesn't look like our Lord is having his year.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.600]   It looks like the snake is on the loose.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.880]   And I don't know about you, but you kind of wonder, man,
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.600]   how in the world do you overcome that?
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.120]   No, there's a section of scripture
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.600]   that's not in the best manuscripts.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.200]   It's the very end of the book of Mark.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.640]   It probably wasn't in the original scripture.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.960]   But it talks about how people that
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   are in relationship with God will
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.640]   be able to handle poisonous snakes
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.200]   and not be affected by them.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.160]   There's some people who have built entire ministries
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.080]   on that verse very unwisely and are snake handlers.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   Now, they, as a matter of course,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.920]   don't look to be bit by those snakes, and they shouldn't.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.160]   Scripture talks about how we don't put the Lord our God
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.720]   to the test.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.440]   But what I want to tell you is that the scriptures do
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.840]   tell us how we can have an antidote, an anti-venom,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.160]   to that snake which wants to take our heart out and defeat
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.660]   us.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.480]   I have been bitten by a poisonous snake,
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.360]   not because I'm a snake handler, but because I
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   was trying to keep some people from being
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.720]   bitten by a poisonous snake.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.180]   And I pinned this thing down, and there was some lady there
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.440]   who said, no, herpetologists don't hurt that.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.680]   That's an innocent snake.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.120]   And I had the snake pinned with a stick.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.960]   I said, ma'am, that is not an innocent snake.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.920]   That is a copperhead.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.320]   She said, my daddy's a herpetologist.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.440]   I know that's a good snake.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.080]   Don't hurt it.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.120]   You people are afraid of all kinds of snakes.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.040]   And it was in some really soft dirt.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.360]   And while I was sitting there, and I had the snake pinned
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.800]   down, I looked up, and I go, ma'am,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.380]   do you see the hourglass design on the back?
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.840]   You can't really tell by the head
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.560]   that it's got that diamond shape, and you can't tell.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.880]   And all of a sudden, I felt that thing move.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.240]   I looked at the stick, and that soft, moist soil.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.720]   And right when I pulled my hand up,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.540]   that sucker came up and nailed me.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.720]   And then I sent him to his eternal bliss
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.080]   shortly after that.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.000]   But he sent me.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.840]   I knew immediately.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.800]   And I go, and the other way you can
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000]   know that's a copperhead, because in about 15 minutes,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.760]   my arm's going to look like Popeye.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.560]   And it did.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.240]   And the swelling went all the way up my left hand,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.760]   up to my bicep.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.720]   I went to a hospital in that little country town
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.220]   I was at.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.000]   They said, well, there's a national shortage
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.400]   on anti-venom.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.800]   And I go, what'd you do with the last guy that came here
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.360]   that was bitten by a poisonous snake?
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.400]   They go, well, we careflighted him to Austin.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.780]   And so I go, well, and by the grace of God,
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.820]   we just sat there and watched it for a little bit.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.240]   And my body, for whatever reason,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.340]   was able, in about five hours, to just stop it
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.060]   at the very top of my bicep and start to push it back.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.460]   And after about five or six days,
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.460]   I was able to close my hand again.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.020]   I don't know what it was about me that
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.420]   was able to not be affected in a fatal way
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.500]   by that particular snake.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.900]   Maybe it didn't get enough of its venom in me
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.740]   because I pulled my hand back, or whatever it was.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.820]   I don't believe it's because I'm somehow
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.220]   specially designated by God that I can
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.620]   do something in scripture I would never do it again.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.680]   I'd kill the snake and then show the herpetologist's
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.380]   daughter it was a poisonous snake.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.340]   Stupid me.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.860]   But what I wanna share with you tonight
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.140]   is the anti-venom to losing heart
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.620]   in a world like we're in today.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.000]   I'm gonna take you to the probably best place
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.720]   in scripture for you to see the compassion of God for you,
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.980]   the length to which God has gone for you to rescue you,
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.340]   and how you can be rescued from the snake,
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.540]   both temporally and where what happens
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.800]   shortly after this section of scripture,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.500]   eternally, you can be saved.
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.260]   We're gonna use the book of Mark to do it.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.560]   It also shows up in Matthew 26.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.260]   But look with me at Mark chapter 14, verse 26 and following.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.300]   And so we are in Gethsemane.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.860]   It is a garden there in the base of the Mount of Olives.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.860]   If you read the scriptures, sometimes you hear
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.460]   about how Jesus went from the Mount of Olives
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.820]   to the Temple Mount, back and forth one day.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.460]   And most of you, especially if you live
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.980]   in the United States of America,
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.820]   are used to thinking about mountains like
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.380]   Pike's Peak or some other huge mountain range.
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.620]   Like man, what's the Bible talking about
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.460]   he went back and forth?
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.820]   You know, it takes 12 hours to go up there
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:20.780]   to that mountain and back.
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.800]   Well, the Mount of Olives is not very big.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.580]   It would almost be probably about twice the size
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.540]   of this building stacked on top of each other
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.660]   over a long slope.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.740]   It's maybe a 15 minute walk from the Mount of Olives
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.140]   down to the Kidron Valley up to the Temple Mount.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.660]   At the very base of the Mount of Olives,
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.680]   there was an olive grove.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.620]   And it had a name in that little place.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.860]   It's called a garden in one place.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.220]   It wasn't a garden, there weren't many gardens
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.540]   in that part of Jerusalem.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.420]   But it was a peaceful place and it was called Gethsemane.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.460]   It was called that because of what olive press means.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.060]   There's a really great reason that Jesus did
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.060]   what we're about to read that he did in Gethsemane.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.940]   Geth is the Hebrew word, or actually the Arabic word
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   for oil and shemin is press.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.780]   So Gethsemane is oil press.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.220]   I'm gonna show you a picture of an oil press.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.180]   I'm also gonna tell you something else that's kinda cool.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.060]   This is in the town that Jesus spent most of his time in.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.260]   This was in Capernaum.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.820]   And if you go to Capernaum today,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.220]   you'll come across an oil press
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.620]   and you'll also right next to it have a millstone.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.020]   So there on the left is the millstone.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.980]   You can see there's a hole like a donut stone.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.740]   If you put like a, imagine a beam that was put through there
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.100]   and an animal would be put on the other end of that beam
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.460]   and harnessed in and that animal would walk circles
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.940]   around that little millstone area
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.820]   and that huge stone, it's called a thalyssis,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.140]   would crush the grain and make it flour.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.700]   Okay, so on the left is a millstone
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.860]   and where they crush grain.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.460]   On the right right there is an oil press, a goth shemin.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.460]   What would happen is they would take olives
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.320]   and when you would lean that big stone back,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.700]   you can see there's a little hole in that thing.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.180]   When you put a beam in, two guys would tip it back,
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.340]   they'd put the olives underneath it
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.700]   and they would let that huge stone crush it
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.440]   and then the olive oil would come out that little drain
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.980]   and fill up that little basin
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.340]   and it would create a great deal of prosperity and life
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.500]   and provision for the people of Capernaum.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.540]   So back to me.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.580]   Couple things that are amazing about this.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.500]   The word that shows up in John chapter 16
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.700]   where Jesus says to them,
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.020]   "These things I've spoken to you so that in me
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.140]   "you might have peace," shalom in the Hebrew.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.900]   "In the world you will have thalyssis,
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.700]   "you will have crushing stones."
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:56.640]   Trials, tribulation is the way we translate it in English.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.220]   But there are gonna be things that try and crush you.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.640]   But take courage, for I have overcome the world.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.940]   Now in Mark chapter 14, he is in the place
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.220]   where you're gonna find that which was the source
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.080]   of greatest provision for Israel, the olive.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.120]   It lit their houses, it was part of their major
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.260]   industry of trade and commerce.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.020]   It was a source of life and provision for them.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.900]   What you're gonna find out is there is a fruit
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.340]   of the branch that is about to be crushed here
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.360]   that from that crushing will come life and provision
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.620]   and light for the people.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.300]   And so Jesus is in the place of crushing.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.980]   And the snake seemed to have his way.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.460]   When the movie Passion, you guys familiar
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.420]   with the movie Passion Mel Gibson made years ago?
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.820]   When that movie was first coming out,
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.180]   there was a group of us that were asked
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.860]   to come out to Gibson Studios and watch it
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.980]   and give feedback to some of the stuff that was in there.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.620]   And I remember watching how that movie starts.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.220]   It starts in Gethsemane.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.660]   And I love it because at the very beginning
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.300]   it shows that Jesus is against the snake who's coming.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.940]   He's praying and he's warring.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.720]   And he's at his time of greatest crisis.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.100]   And it shows the snake that comes up
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.140]   and as he's praying and he's being tempted
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.940]   to just not trust God the Father,
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.540]   that snake is there hissing, mocking him.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.620]   And that movie kind of starts with Jesus standing up
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.840]   and just going, stomping that snake's head.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.100]   It's a reference all the way back to Genesis 3
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.660]   where it says that he, the serpent,
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.940]   will strike you on the heel but you will crush his head.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.820]   There's going to be a moment in this world
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.340]   where the king of kings, the stronger one,
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.340]   crushes the strong man.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.580]   It's gonna look like you're hit by this snake
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.620]   that you can't overcome from, but he will crush his head.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.520]   That's exactly what happened to Jesus.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.540]   He was bitten, if you will, by death and betrayal of men,
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.760]   but he conquered it because the wages of sin is death.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.540]   And because Jesus was he who had no sin,
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.940]   he conquered the grave and paid the debt
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.740]   and crushed sin and death.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.660]   What I wanna show you is how you handle
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.600]   the kind of stuff that is going on in our world today.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.980]   And we're gonna use it,
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.300]   use this little section of Scripture.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.020]   So here's what's happening.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.980]   In Mark chapter 14, verse 26, it says,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.200]   "Jesus and his disciples had left the upper room
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.300]   "and they sang a hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.020]   "Jesus told them, hey, listen, you're all gonna fall away.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.760]   "That's what all men will do if they don't listen
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.760]   "to the antidote to the venom of the snake's presence."
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.080]   You're gonna fall away.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.880]   You are going to be troubled.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.460]   You're not going to have peace.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.780]   You're gonna be overwhelmed.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.240]   You're gonna be filled with despair.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.840]   You're gonna find coping strategies and techniques
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.840]   either through medicating yourself
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.760]   or by pretending that trouble isn't really there
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.020]   or by joining evil.
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.960]   And what I wanna tell you today
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.120]   is that there is another tribe of people
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.320]   that are to face down evil and not be filled with despair
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.800]   whose hearts aren't gonna be troubled,
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.240]   who aren't gonna be surprised
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.440]   when they watch the snake have his day.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:16.280]   Because he has not ultimately been eliminated yet.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.160]   Jesus says he has been defeated, but he is still present.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.520]   And you are my people to rescue folks
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.400]   from his poison of lies and deceit about me.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.760]   And you should suffer as I have suffered.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.040]   And you take heart, you have courage.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.520]   For I have defeated that serpent.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.080]   But don't be surprised.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.040]   He said to his disciples,
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   listen, you're gonna all fall away 'cause it's written,
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.000]   I'm gonna strike down the shepherd
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.920]   and the sheep will be scattered,
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.000]   but after I have been raised,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.880]   I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.720]   Remember he told them right there,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.360]   listen, I'm going to be raised from the grave.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.380]   Even to his disciples, take heart.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.920]   When it looks like the serpent's winning,
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.840]   he's not winning, this is my plan.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.760]   Jesus said, no one's gonna take my life from me.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.460]   I'm gonna lay it down and I'm gonna take it back up again.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.920]   Jesus was not betrayed by somebody that surprised him.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.720]   He was not overcome by people
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.160]   that were more powerful than him.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.520]   When he was being questioned by Pilate,
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.700]   and Pilate said, don't you hear me talking to you?
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.040]   Don't you know I'm the one that has the power
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:13.880]   to set you free?
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.360]   Jesus, in his beaten state, I think leaned up
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.480]   and pulled him down and said, you have no authority
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.680]   except my Father in heaven has given it to you.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.200]   Now you go and do what you're gonna do.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.580]   And I'm gonna do what I need to do
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.000]   because I love men like you.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.980]   But you wanna know what truth is?
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.940]   I am the truth.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.700]   And I am the way and I am the life.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.060]   And you better not fear man, you better fear me.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.980]   That man's wife warned him, that's a good man.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.680]   But because he feared man and was intimidated
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.500]   by the serpent of lies who told him,
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.800]   if you don't do what men want you to do,
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.220]   it's not gonna go well with you,
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.620]   he made a bad choice and the venom of sin took him out.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.060]   But Jesus went forward and did what he had to do
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.320]   and defeated that serpent.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.840]   He's telling his disciples, no one's gonna take my life.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.080]   But Peter said, listen, even though all may fall away,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.200]   yet I will not, Jesus said to him, truly I say to you
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.460]   that this very night before a rooster crows twice,
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.000]   you yourself will deny me three times.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.640]   But Peter kept saying, no man,
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.680]   even if I've gotta die with you, I will not deny you.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.520]   And they were all saying the same thing also.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.420]   So it wasn't just Peter who denied him.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.340]   It was all of them.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.420]   Now there were three that were the most vocal
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.600]   about the fact that they weren't going to cave
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.840]   in the midst of the coming persecution.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.120]   James, John, and Peter.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.760]   And you're gonna see that Jesus pulls those three
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.440]   who were in unique positions of leadership.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.280]   If you go and look at the listing of the disciples,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   you'll see that they're put in some groupings.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.040]   And many people believe that what Jesus did
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.260]   is he had the 12 disciples,
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.680]   but there was even order within that.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.080]   And Peter, James, and John were leaders of smaller groups.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.280]   And so he invested in all 12 of them
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.860]   and in the 70 in the multitude,
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.360]   but he built into those three leaders specifically.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.320]   And those three leaders were the most vocal
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.820]   about their passion for Jesus.
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.680]   I'm gonna tell you tonight, your passion for God,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.180]   your passion for Jesus is not going to get you through.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:13.460]   And Jesus is gonna show you what's gonna get you through
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.560]   the day of the snake.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   So these three guys are all like, hey man, here we go.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.920]   They came to get Semeny, and he said to his disciples,
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.000]   sit here until I have prayed.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.160]   And he took with him Peter.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.220]   He took with him James and John.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.000]   Peter's the one who boasted, said he would not deny him.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.160]   James and John were the two that a little bit earlier
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.680]   had asked Jesus if they could be in positions
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   of ultimate importance.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.040]   One in his right hand, one in his left.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.600]   And Jesus said, hey, are you willing to drink the cup
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.440]   that I'm about to drink?
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.840]   And they said, we'll drink that cup.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.320]   We'll go through and we'll suffer the way
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.760]   you're gonna suffer to get what we want from you.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.240]   And Jesus said, all right, you'll drink the cup.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.080]   We'll see.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.660]   And so Jesus took Peter and James and John,
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.380]   and he was about to show them the antidote
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.980]   to fear, failure, and despair.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.300]   Now here's what's really great
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.620]   about what I'm about to read to you.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.740]   What you're about to hear right here is something
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.980]   that would almost unsettle you if you weren't somebody
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.340]   who really understood the scriptures.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.300]   If you didn't understand who Jesus was
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.420]   when he walked on this earth as the incarnate,
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.260]   that's just the word that means in the flesh,
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.760]   carnal as flesh, that he was the incarnate son of God.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.220]   The scripture says this about Jesus,
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.420]   that Jesus always was God.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.780]   He never stopped being God.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.540]   But in Philippians 2, it describes this.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.020]   It says that Jesus, who though he existed in the form of God,
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.020]   he did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.300]   Sometimes words are really helpful.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.120]   You know, you go to a zoo, you see a monkey,
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.320]   and they can swing with their hands,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.280]   and they also grab a bar with their tail.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.700]   And if you ever sometimes read about a monkey,
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.200]   you will find that a monkey has what's called
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.880]   a prehensile tail.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.900]   A prehensile tail means a tail that can grab like an arm.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.020]   That comes from the Greek word which means to grab.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.420]   We take the English word, it's a transliteration.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.860]   We take a word trans, which means across, literally,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.860]   and we use it.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.760]   And so prehensile is a word
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.320]   that just basically means to grab.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.340]   It says Jesus didn't grab on to his deity
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.420]   because he was a good and loving king.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.260]   Let me just say this.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.500]   As you start to evaluate your leaders,
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.940]   here's one of the things you wanna look for.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.980]   What most men do is they want power
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.380]   so they could lord that power over people.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.680]   Small men use their power to maintain their power.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.040]   Great men use power to serve the people underneath them.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.000]   It's why so many politicians are always telling you
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.460]   what they're gonna do for you,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.600]   but then when they get up there,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.360]   all they really try and do is please the most constituents
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.240]   so they can stay in power.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.960]   One of the problem is is we've got a bunch of politicians
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.320]   who are telling you what you wanna hear
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.080]   instead of statesmen who do what the state needs.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.320]   You wanna evaluate leaders?
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.180]   Evaluate your leaders by asking yourself,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:14.020]   is this guy really concerned with me
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.860]   or is he just looking for power?
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.960]   And it's hard to tell because they are selling.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.960]   Ladies, let's leave the presidential election for a second
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.560]   and let's talk about dating.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:31.200]   When you meet a guy, he is politicking, all right?
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.520]   He is selling.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.440]   He is looking for your vote.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.480]   He wants you to install him in the presidential office
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.920]   of being your bae right there, all right?
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.260]   And he wants to be your man.
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.880]   And so if all you do is watch him on the campaign trail,
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.120]   you do not have enough data.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.080]   All right?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.520]   So what you've gotta do
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.360]   is you don't watch the way he treats you
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.520]   and you don't watch the way he talks to you
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.760]   with his stump speech, all right?
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.920]   Often while he slides you a cold one
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.760]   that will numb you to reality.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.040]   You wanna watch the way that guy treats people
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.720]   who can do nothing for him.
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.640]   You wanna watch that guy's history.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.900]   Does he have a history of people who he's close to
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.380]   and who he serves and he gives himself a way toward
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.080]   and the best predictor of future performance
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.700]   is past performance.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.420]   It's not a guarantee,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.820]   but if all you do is listen to the stump speech,
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.460]   then you're gonna get exactly what you deserve.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.260]   What Jesus is gonna show you
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.020]   is that he uses power correctly.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.020]   For even the son of man, Mark 10, 45 says,
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.580]   to not come to be served, but to serve
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.260]   and to give his life away as a ransom for many.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.420]   Because it says, "Jesus, though he was God,
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.100]   "he didn't regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.540]   "but he emptied himself."
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.700]   In other words, he chose not to allow himself,
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.860]   though he was still God, to act like God,
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.100]   meaning that he could do what he wanted to do
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.660]   when he wanted to do it, and he took the form,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.420]   watch this, this is theology for you,
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   he took the form of a bond servant
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.540]   and being made in the likeness of a man
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.580]   and being found in appearance as a man,
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.980]   he humbled himself by becoming obedient
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.260]   to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.940]   And he did this because he cares for you
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.260]   and he hates the snake.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:36.460]   And so Jesus remained God, but he allowed himself,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.220]   he emptied himself of his right in the incarnation
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.980]   to act as God would act when he wanted to act,
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.420]   and he put himself like a man.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   What's a man gotta do?
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.980]   He has to depend on God.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.060]   Without God, he will be overwhelmed with despair.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.220]   Without God's word, he will be overwhelmed
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.780]   with sin and deceit.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.420]   Without the spirit, he will lack power.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.300]   And so Jesus is the illustration of what a perfect man does.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.420]   And Jesus can identify with you as you are tempted
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:11.900]   to cave in when you are intimidated by the snake,
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.380]   who will tell you that God doesn't love you,
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.060]   God doesn't care about you,
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.740]   he didn't have your best interest in mind,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.580]   if he did, this would not be your circumstance,
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.700]   why are you worshiping a God you can't see?
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.580]   Look at me, I'm the powerful one,
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.700]   I'm the one that's causing havoc all around here,
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.460]   you better align yourself with me.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.860]   I'm the one that can give you
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.580]   immediate feedback and pleasure.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.420]   God isn't good, his word's not true,
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.580]   and disobeying him is not that big a deal.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.220]   I disobeyed him and I'm prince of this world.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.980]   That is true.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.820]   But the King of Kings and Lord of Lords
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.460]   is gonna say, you're gonna rule for a while,
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.300]   but I'm gonna run your little King Krober self
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.220]   out of that house when it's time for me to run,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.900]   I know right where you're hiding.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.620]   And I'm gonna defang you, and I'm gonna slap you silly,
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.140]   and I'm gonna enthrone myself forever,
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.700]   and the reason I'm not doing that right now
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.500]   is because if I came to judge wickedness
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.980]   all over the world, people have asked me this,
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.940]   some of you guys know we do a thing
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.220]   called Real Truth Real Quick,
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.660]   and one we did recently was,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.860]   why doesn't God stop all these mass shootings
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.700]   and acts of terror?
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.340]   Here's the reason, because we call evil
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.660]   things that are evil to us,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.140]   but we're not the standard of evil.
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.740]   If God came to judge evil,
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.500]   things like mass shootings and terror,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.180]   he's gonna judge all mass rebellion against him,
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.980]   and all terror, but it's not just
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.660]   when some guy storms into a nightclub,
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.540]   or some guy takes an AR-15 and starts shooting
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.460]   at what we call innocent people,
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.420]   or when some guy mows down a bunch of folks
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.540]   watching a firework show, we call that evil,
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.540]   but how many folks the night that Orlando Killer
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.620]   in Florida was shooting folks
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.540]   were acting in a way that was immoral and offensive to God?
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.580]   I'm not talking just about in a homosexual nightclub,
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.900]   I'm talking about all over Miami,
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.620]   I'm talking about all the heterosexual rebellion
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.340]   that was there, I'm talking about all the guys
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.660]   that weren't at home with their wives,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.820]   I'm talking about the guys that were home
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.620]   with their families and were being unkind to them,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.980]   I'm talking about the rich people
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:03.460]   on their little Miami Beach houses
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.820]   that didn't care about the poor and distressed among them,
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.340]   I'm talking about everything that God says is evil,
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.860]   and when we say, God, why don't you stop evil,
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.260]   we better realize that that would include us,
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:19.860]   because the standard is not Hitler to me, it's God to me,
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.320]   and I don't meet that standard,
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.860]   and the Bible tells us why God has not yet
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.300]   run the King Cobra out of the house,
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.620]   that's 'cause a lot of us have his blood flowing through us,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.940]   and until we get the antidote
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.220]   of Christ's righteousness for ours,
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.500]   we would all be under judgment,
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.740]   and so the scripture says,
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.740]   God is not slow as some count slowness,
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.160]   but is patient towards you,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.860]   because he desires that none should perish,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.420]   but that all should come to eternal life,
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.580]   but what he tells you is that while you're in the world
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.940]   and you come to recognize the kindness of God,
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.460]   that he would give himself for you,
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.100]   that he would go before you,
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.660]   and he would defeat the strong man that you can't defeat,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.100]   because he's the stronger one,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.040]   that he would slap sin silly,
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.740]   that he would defeat death and sin,
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.260]   he would pay your wage that you could never pay,
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.200]   when you acknowledged your debt to God,
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.700]   and see his provision for you,
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.100]   and you trust in it, and you become his,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.180]   he says then, stay here and serve me,
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.760]   and you take heart,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.980]   and you be filled with peace,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.640]   knowing that you've got the antidote to sin.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.880]   There may still be some evil that slays you,
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.460]   and saws you in half,
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.580]   this world may not go like you like it,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.860]   but you faithfully serve me,
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.420]   and it's gonna be hard sometimes,
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.260]   because it's gonna look like
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.460]   the king cobra has taken over the house.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.740]   Here's the antidote.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:43.560]   Here's how you can be a person
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.460]   who doesn't get overwhelmed with despair,
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.980]   you go, Todd, you don't know despair,
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.140]   you don't know the pain that I've had,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.340]   you don't know where I've been bit
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.740]   with the venom of sin in this world.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.580]   I'm gonna show you somebody who does.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.420]   There could not be stronger words used
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.180]   than the words we're about to read.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:07.180]   It says that he began to be very distressed.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.180]   The word that is there is not important
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.300]   how you pronounce it in the Greek,
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.940]   it just means he was frozen,
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.980]   he was stuck in fear.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.860]   The word is distressed, but it is a very strong word.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.180]   It means that he was absolutely overwhelmed
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.500]   with the awe of terror.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.540]   It's like frozen in his tracks.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.100]   This is who Jesus was, this is the way it describes him.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.180]   It says Jesus became very distressed,
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.220]   stuck with terror, and troubled.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.780]   This is an amazing word.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:44.660]   This means to be very filled with heaviness, great anguish.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.980]   There's three words that are translated depression
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.100]   in your Bible, this is the strongest.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.100]   It's a compound of two words.
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.620]   One is a kratos, which means unmixed,
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:54.780]   and the other one, I give it to you
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.500]   'cause you recognize it, hades, which means hell.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.500]   What it's saying, if you literally translated this,
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.860]   is that Jesus began to be frozen with terror.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:11.340]   He was filled with unmixed hell.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.540]   It wasn't deluded at all.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.140]   And he said to them, my soul, my psyche,
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.140]   my very inner being is deeply grieved
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.380]   to the point of death.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.940]   That word shows up 17 times in your Bible every time.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.860]   It means death.
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.780]   I have no strength, I am frozen, I am unable.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.500]   This is unmixed hell.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.580]   You guys, we say it all the time, this is hell on earth.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.820]   Jesus has experienced that.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.460]   I'm gonna show you why he's experiencing that,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.580]   because he knew that he was moving to something
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.860]   that he had never experienced before his entire life.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.900]   It was one thing for Jesus to come to earth
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.860]   and identify as a man, but man has the ability
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.460]   and the privilege and the freedom
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.900]   to have a relationship with God, do you know that?
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.740]   Do you guys know that?
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.940]   God is here, he is a very present God.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.140]   He longs to have a relationship with you.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.700]   God wants a relationship with you
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.420]   more than you will ever want a relationship with him.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.060]   And Jesus, because he's the perfect man,
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.100]   always sought that relationship,
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.060]   because he had nothing to do with deceit and error.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.780]   He was a man who knew no sin,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.180]   and men who knew no sin must know God.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.940]   And so even though Jesus was a man,
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.740]   he was a man who knew no sin,
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.900]   and men who knew no sin must know God.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.660]   And so even though Jesus was God,
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.420]   he did not use his own Godness as ability to get through,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.420]   but as a perfect man, he always trusted in God the Father.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.340]   He had never been apart from God.
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.420]   He had a peace that passed understanding,
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.260]   because in everything, with prayer and supplication,
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.180]   through thanksgiving, he let his request be made known
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.860]   to God and the peace of God comforted him.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.220]   And then, lastly, whatever is excellent
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.820]   and worthy of praise, he let his mind
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.820]   meditate on those things.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.220]   That doesn't mean that Jesus never looked at porn.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.140]   It means that Jesus always was aware of the fact
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.180]   that there was a loving, sovereign Father
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.420]   that knew that this world has been spinning out of control,
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.300]   not just since some guy uncorked his madness
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.540]   in Dallas a while ago,
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.740]   or not since Hitler killed six million Jews,
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.260]   or not because Stalin killed tens of thousands of people
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.500]   every single day during his communist takeover of Ukraine,
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.900]   there's been hell and trouble on this earth
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.860]   ever since man stopped enjoying his relationship with God
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.140]   and said, "I'll do business with the snake,"
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.580]   and the venom of sin has been running through us.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:39.500]   And so we've been self-centered, hateful, destructive people
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.100]   to one another, missing out on the peace that God intends.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.780]   Jesus knew he was about to go someplace
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.900]   where he was going to be separated from the Father
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.180]   because the Scripture says he was going to become sin
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.020]   on our behalf.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.780]   The Scripture says God made him who knew no sin
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.140]   to become sin on our behalf,
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.820]   that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.660]   Why?
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.060]   Because Jesus used his power, he used his eternal perfection
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:09.340]   to pay for you what you, in your damned, sinful state,
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.980]   could never pay for yourself.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.660]   This is the Scripture that is saying,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.140]   watch the love of God.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.900]   You wanna know what the love of God has looked like?
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.740]   This is it.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.660]   It's not like, you better behave long enough, well enough,
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.740]   so that I approve of you.
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.820]   No, the love of God is that there is no way
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.380]   that you could ever be perfect.
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.820]   When you've got the venom running through your body,
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.300]   you have death running through your body,
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.580]   and what you need is to be born again.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.380]   And I am a God who is slow to anger,
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.060]   I'm abounding in love and kindness,
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.100]   but I wanna tell you what, I gotta deal with reality,
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.060]   and reality is there is death in you,
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:46.100]   and there's rebellion against me, and so I am a just God.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.500]   And so I've gotta pour out my wrath on your sin.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.100]   And so how's God deal with that?
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.500]   The Scripture says this way.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:03.660]   In the person of the Son, I will still maintain my Godness,
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.020]   but I will put it aside and not hold on to it,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.860]   and I will take on the likeness of a man
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.500]   and being found in the appearance of a man.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.700]   I will walk as a man.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.060]   I will feel the hiss of the enemy.
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.100]   I will feel the venom of sin all around me.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.220]   I will feel the taunt of temptation
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.500]   to believe that God is not there and he's forgotten me,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.740]   and I will abide with him, I will walk with him,
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.100]   and I will live a sinless life,
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.380]   and I will pay the debt of sin,
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.780]   and I will go to death so that the wages of sin can be met,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.820]   so that the free gift through God
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.980]   can be eternal life through Christ Jesus.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.260]   Folks, let me just tell you what's so amazing
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.300]   about this series, listen to me.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.380]   This is not just a story,
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.460]   I'm not just some Greek mythological,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.460]   narrative spinner, I'm not Homer
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.700]   trying to weave some story to motivate you to go to war.
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.340]   What I am telling you is you go look at history,
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.100]   and God in his kindness has decided to pivot history
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.540]   on the year of the Lord.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.220]   And this stuff is anchored in history.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.460]   What you have in the Bible
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.540]   is not a bunch of religious men writing,
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.900]   you have eyewitness accounts of what happened in history.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.820]   You don't believe the ones that made it into our Bible?
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:20.560]   Read Secundus, read Tacitus, read Josephus, read history.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.260]   There was a man named Jesus who lived,
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:29.260]   who performed miracles, who fulfilled prophecy,
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.660]   who was crucified by Pontius Pilate,
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:38.500]   and who appeared to many having risen from the dead.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.540]   And I'm here to tell you that our Lord lives,
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.580]   and he said, "Having now saved you from death,
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.860]   "there's gonna be others who hear my story of reconciliation
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.720]   "and I want you to suffer with me
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.300]   "and live in this world still filled with trouble
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.360]   "until I close up history,
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.420]   "'cause there are some who don't know that story.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.100]   "But you will be overwhelmed with despair
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.620]   "and you will not be able to stay and watch
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.860]   "if you do not do what Jesus does."
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.840]   And so here we go.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.280]   It says, "My soul is deeply grieved to the point of death,"
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.600]   then verse 34, "Remain here and keep watch."
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.120]   There's a reason that that shows up.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.920]   Keep watch, keep watch, be on the alert, be on the alert.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.680]   And he went a little beyond them and fell to the ground
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.160]   and began to pray that if it were possible,
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.920]   the hour might pass by him.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.860]   This hour that was deeply distressing him,
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.800]   it was the hour when he became sin.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.820]   And the Father in that moment turned himself from him.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.140]   And to Jesus, that is what had him filled with distress.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.180]   It wasn't that there was an enemy
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.500]   that was filling men with deceit
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.260]   and power hungry men that were gonna use their power
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.520]   to try and destroy somebody that threatened their positions.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.900]   What scared Jesus was not death in the world.
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.820]   What scared Jesus is being separated from the God
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.140]   who alone is the author of life,
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.700]   for even a moment when he became sin for you and I.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.120]   And so he said, "Father, if there's any other way
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.960]   "that we can pull this,"
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.740]   remember he knew the plan from eternity past,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.120]   but he's saying right now, "Father, Father,
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.420]   "all things are possible for you.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.380]   "Remove this cup from me, yet not what I will,
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.840]   "but what you will, because in my humanness,
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.260]   "I don't wanna go through with this.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.300]   "In my perfect God-man state,
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.560]   "I know how much I need you to be separated from you
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.900]   "is anguish, and I don't wanna be apart from you
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.360]   "for a moment, I never have been, even on earth.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.620]   "As a man, I've trusted in you
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.100]   "and abided with you continually."
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.340]   That's why he had no sin.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.580]   And he said, "Being separated from you
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.700]   "is gonna be unmixed hell."
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.080]   That's what separation from God always is.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:51.900]   But he came back, verse 37, he found them sleeping,
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.420]   and he said to Peter, watch this,
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.700]   Simon, now watch, it's interesting,
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.980]   he said to Peter, "Simon," now why does he do that?
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.020]   In Mark chapter three, it's when he calls the disciples,
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.780]   and he says to one of them, "Your name is Simon,"
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.480]   which means to hear, "Hear my calling on you,
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.740]   "and I will make you a rock, I will make you Peter.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.540]   "As you follow me and trust in me,
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.520]   "I will build you on a rock, and I will make you a rock,
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.120]   "and people will marvel at your strength,
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.640]   "but Peter, you're gonna become a strength,
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.540]   "Simon, when you hear me."
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.700]   And what is happening at this moment is Peter, the rock,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.940]   was not a rock because he wasn't listening
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.300]   to the command of the king.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.420]   And he was that weak person again.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.380]   That's what all men are, I don't care how long,
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.320]   and how much I and other leaders at this ministry
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.000]   and other ministries or any other place
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.080]   where you see people who are walking with God,
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.460]   I don't care how long you've walked with God,
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.580]   the second that I stop abiding with Jesus
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.420]   and depending on Jesus and being watchful and prayerful
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.720]   and in community with his people,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.200]   I am gonna become somebody who is deaf to the truth
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.600]   and the goodness of God, and I will become powerless,
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.800]   and I will not have my life built on the rock,
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.280]   I will be overcome, I will not have peace,
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.440]   I will give in to tribulation, and I will cause tribulation.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.480]   That's why Jesus said, man, apart from me,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.440]   you can do nothing.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.320]   The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.400]   That doesn't mean you're scared of God,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.800]   it means that you're scared of the idea
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.000]   that'll be separated you even from a moment.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.600]   He said, Peter, you're acting like Simon,
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.940]   a man that doesn't know me and doesn't trust in me.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.320]   Are you asleep?
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.240]   Wake up.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.100]   Couldn't you keep watch for even an hour?
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.160]   Keep watching and praying
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.820]   that you don't come into temptation.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.120]   The spirit is willing, Peter, but the flesh is weak.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.960]   And it says again, he went away and prayed,
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.320]   saying the exact same words,
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   Father, I don't wanna be separated from you.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   Nothing is more horrifying to me
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.560]   than to be separated from you.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.160]   But not my will, but your will be done.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.260]   And again, he came and he found them sleeping,
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.400]   for their eyes were very heavy,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.080]   and they did not know what to answer him.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.980]   Let me just make a little note.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.720]   This happens three different times.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.740]   I think the reason that Jesus chose Peter, James, and John
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.600]   to be with him at that moment
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.000]   is they were the most vocal disciples.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.760]   Hey, we'll drink the cup of suffering.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.320]   Hey, I don't care if everybody else abandons you,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.740]   I'm willing to die for you.
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.200]   Those men were passionately in their flesh
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.040]   in love with Jesus, but watch this.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:09.160]   Passionate devotion to God is not going to be enough.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.080]   Humble obedience is what it takes
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.160]   to be a person who is not overcome by sin and temptation.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.560]   Let me say that to you again.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.480]   We don't in here on Tuesday nights
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.160]   try and work you up into some emotional fervor
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.520]   that will carry you until the next porch day.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.320]   Or because we're just a part of the church
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.360]   until Sunday.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.100]   What we're trying to ask you to do
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.160]   is to know the goodness of God and to walk with him,
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.560]   and to abide with him, to not leave here
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.600]   in a fit of religious fervor,
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.040]   and then eventually drift back into the ways of the world,
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.640]   and walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.940]   and stand in the path of sinners,
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.220]   and sit in the seat of scoffers,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.080]   only to be jerked out of it on Sunday,
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.280]   back to some obedience,
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.400]   and then only have two days to make it back to the porch
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.480]   where you can be strong and passionate for Jesus again.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.840]   No, what we're telling you to do is be watchful and pray.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.480]   And when your heart is overcome,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.520]   to make sure you do what Jesus did here,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.720]   you run to God in jubility,
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.520]   and you surround yourself with his people
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.960]   who encourage you and remind you of what is true.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:16.620]   That is how you don't give in to despair
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.040]   and the intimidation of the serpent.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.140]   There's so much for us to learn right here.
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.440]   And I'll say this to you.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:29.480]   Sometimes people, even in the way that they marry,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.360]   when we have folks that are kind of going through
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.600]   what we call merge here at Watermark,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.840]   or they get ready to get married,
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.040]   and sometimes I just say to people,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:35.880]   man, what's your plan?
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.540]   How do you guys, what's your plan
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.840]   for having a successful marriage?
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.680]   You go, we're just gonna love each other.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.840]   That's wonderful, I'm glad that you're gonna love each other.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.680]   And how you gonna do that?
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.160]   Oh, I won't tell you, Tom, we love each other.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.840]   I mean, Romeo and Juliet, I mean, those guys,
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.360]   they're like platonic relationships compared to us.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.820]   I mean, we're all in, right?
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.400]   No two people have ever loved each other.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.520]   We hang out and say, isn't she beautiful?
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.360]   Right, they got that thing, you know,
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.120]   like how they call the wild, look at each other,
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:00.960]   like, oh.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:04.320]   And they think that they're gonna be fine
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.520]   from here on out going forward.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.920]   And I just look at them, I go, hey, bro,
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   let me just tell you something.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.700]   I don't care how much you feel like right now
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.200]   you love her and cherish her.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.200]   You're gonna have to learn to die to yourself
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.660]   and not just get carried away by some emotion.
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.800]   Because that feeling is gonna fade, man.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.060]   And if you don't have something stronger than how you feel,
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.840]   that relationship won't last.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.200]   If you don't learn to love her with an everlasting love,
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.760]   if the love that's informing you
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.800]   is not the love of the flesh and the love of youth,
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.080]   but if it's not the love of Christ,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.920]   if you're not willing to love her
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.020]   the way Christ loves the church,
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.160]   how did Christ love the church?
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.080]   It wasn't because she was beautiful.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.640]   It was while the church was still the center,
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.280]   he demonstrated his love for her.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.760]   He cherished her and honored her.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.880]   He willingly and unconditionally and in grace
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.960]   moved towards her and in his desire to redeem her
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.020]   and made her beautiful with his affection
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.240]   and provision and selflessness.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.480]   That's the biblical picture of love.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.000]   Love is patient and kind.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.520]   It doesn't boast, it's not arrogant.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.840]   It's not jealous.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.200]   It doesn't take into account a wrong suffered.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.340]   It doesn't act unbecomingly.
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.200]   It's not provoked.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.560]   It doesn't seek its own.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.320]   Not a single one of those descriptors of love
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.240]   have anything to do with how you feel.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.800]   It's everything to do with how you will to act.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.240]   And the only way that you can will to love somebody
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.840]   biblically is when you know what love looks like biblically.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.120]   And love is defined by a cross,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.960]   not by some love song on the edge of a dock
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.080]   under some full moon.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.520]   And so don't tell me about your passion for one another.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.400]   You tell me about your passion for Jesus
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.920]   because of the love expressed to you for him
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.580]   and that you wanna follow him and love others
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.440]   with the love which he has loved you.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.380]   And then your relationship has a chance.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.100]   That's why Jesus begs you.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.260]   Man, I don't care who you marry, but I wanna beg you.
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.020]   Please, please don't give yourself uncovenant
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.500]   with somebody who isn't covenant with me
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.400]   because they will not be able to love you
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.620]   the way that you deserve to be.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.540]   I've designed you to be loved.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.900]   Find somebody who already is loved by me
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.740]   and you might have a chance if they continue
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.100]   to abide with me to have an abiding relationship
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:14.940]   with one another.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.140]   Jesus shows us how to pray
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:26.120]   and he shows us that we must pray.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.360]   You'll notice that from this moment when they get up,
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.780]   the disciples go every direction
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.460]   except the direction that Jesus calls them to do.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:34.860]   It's because they were not watchful
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.160]   and they were not praying.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.020]   Jesus reminds us in Gethsemane that if we do not pray,
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.080]   we do not have an opportunity.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.340]   You will always do the reasonable thing
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:50.580]   if you are not somebody who does the right thing,
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.500]   which is to pray.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.580]   The reasonable thing for Jesus to do
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.800]   was gonna say this doesn't make any sense for me,
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.660]   the son of God, to go to a cross.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.160]   As a man, it makes no sense.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.380]   If I was Peter, I would've done the exact same thing
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.840]   when he said, I know who you are.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.340]   You're the Christ, the son of the living God.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.640]   And Jesus says, blessed are you, Simon.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.420]   You've heard me tell you who I am.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.700]   You've watched what I have done
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.160]   and I'm gonna make you a rock
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.820]   and on the rock of profession, I'm gonna build my church.
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.620]   And then Jesus goes on to say this,
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.140]   but listen, the son of man is gonna go
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.460]   and he's gonna deliver himself up
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.220]   to the Roman authorities and the Jewish authorities
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.620]   and he's gonna be crucified.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.580]   Right after Peter said, I know who you are,
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.420]   you're God in the flesh,
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.700]   God in the flesh said, that's right, Peter.
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.160]   I'm gonna go and I'm gonna give myself for you
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.020]   that you might be redeemed.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.260]   Peter said, God forbid it, Lord.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.860]   No, there's no way you're going to a cross.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.240]   That makes no sense.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.900]   And then Jesus says to him, the Lord rebuke you
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.780]   'cause you're listening to the lie of the serpent
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.380]   that you go right to the crown
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.180]   in exaltation without the cross.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.820]   Peter, listen to me, people, listen to me.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.140]   This is not a mystery.
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.380]   The Christian worldview is the only worldview
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.300]   that makes sense.
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.700]   I have been in rooms with Christopher Hitchens
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.580]   who wrote the book, God is the Son of Man.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.600]   I have been in rooms with Christopher Hitchens
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.440]   who wrote the book, God is Not Great,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.120]   trying to explain why he thought it was crazy
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.080]   to believe in God and I have listened
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.800]   to intellectual reason after intellectual reason
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.640]   be given to him.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.840]   I've heard Christopher Hitchens say,
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.240]   hey, listen, let me just tell you something.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.640]   There is no other philosophy in the world
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.600]   that is consistent, congruent, logical, and coherent
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.240]   except the Christian faith.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.440]   I understand your arguments.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.460]   I can't really come against those arguments
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.300]   except I look at this world filled with chaos and sin
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.380]   and I choose to reject the Christian explanation
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.800]   and therefore I don't think there's a God.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.380]   What he said is against all evidence
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.140]   that can be tested and verified,
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.660]   I reject it because it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:56.540]   But I acknowledge it's consistent, congruent, and coherent.
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:00.540]   But it's not the way I would do it if I was king.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.340]   Well, guess what, Christopher, you're not king.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.640]   And to you, I would say you're not king either.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:10.200]   And in this world, there's gonna continue to be trouble.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.000]   You might have said I wouldn't do this if I was God
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.540]   and here's the thing, all of us,
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.160]   we're here in this world filled with sin
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.600]   because we have chosen to walk away from God.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.500]   We aren't just suffering of trials and tribulations,
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.080]   we're causing them, every single one of us does
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.900]   when we don't abide with Christ and walk closely with him.
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.000]   When God revealed himself to Moses
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.060]   and Moses said, "Tell me who you are,"
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:41.300]   he said, "I am who I am."
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.100]   The Hebrew is Yahweh, I am who I am.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.220]   I always was and I always will be.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.960]   And Moses, the reason the people are oppressed
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.460]   is because the people aren't walking with me.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.960]   I'm gonna show the world who I am
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.700]   through my working in you and through you.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.780]   I'm gonna deliver you, I'm gonna go before you
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.340]   and I'm gonna do what you can't do.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.460]   You are a slave to a king in this world who oppresses you
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.020]   but I'm gonna defeat that king.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.100]   I will open the way for you.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.060]   I will miraculously create an opportunity
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.620]   for you to be set free.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.900]   Trust in me.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:18.580]   You tell the people the I am who has always been sovereign
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.640]   even in this world of sin has come to set them free.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.940]   When Jesus showed up a little bit later
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.120]   and they asked him who he was, he said,
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.860]   "I and the Father are one."
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:33.380]   And Jesus consistently said, "I am."
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:37.800]   And there is trouble here and I have come to defeat it.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.180]   And I understand the pain that you're in.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.020]   Do you understand this?
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.780]   I'm gonna read you one last little bit of scripture
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:44.780]   and we're gonna close.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.900]   It comes in Hebrews chapter five.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.900]   It's amazing little section of scripture
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.720]   because it says something happened here.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.100]   The thing I love about my God is that my God knows
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.420]   what it's like not to be a God.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.920]   My God knows what it's like to be stuck in a world
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.720]   where the serpent still has his way.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.280]   And so what he's begging you to do
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.400]   in the midst of your distress and your trouble
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.200]   and your despair and your literal hell on earth
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.820]   is to listen to him.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.040]   The world is filled with chaos
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.140]   because men don't walk with me.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.680]   Sin and death reign and rule.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.340]   Darkness and hate are here
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.200]   because you've rejected light and love.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.400]   I am the antidote to sin and hate.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.880]   I can set you free.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.900]   I have redeemed some and my people who will walk with me,
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.240]   not in passion but in humble obedience,
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.140]   can be salt and light.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.540]   And they won't be destructive and selfish.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.060]   They may still make some mistakes.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.520]   They'll acknowledge those mistakes.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.240]   They'll repent of those mistakes.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.980]   They'll make amends and they will begin
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.180]   to abide with me again.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.960]   They will confess their sins to one another
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.120]   and they will be healed.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.020]   They will extend forgiveness and receive forgiveness.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:54.500]   And they will suffer because they are still in this world
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.500]   as aliens and strangers, missionaries for me,
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.980]   ambassadors, if you will, pleading as if God himself
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.780]   was pleading through them to redeem them
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.280]   from the venom of sin and rebellion against God.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.940]   And he says, Todd, don't be worried.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.780]   Don't be distressed.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.680]   I can't tell you that your family's not gonna be shot.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.260]   I can't tell you your daughters aren't gonna be raped.
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.620]   I can't tell you that your spouse,
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.540]   who's been faithful for 25 plus years,
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.620]   won't go crazy tomorrow.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.340]   If she doesn't abide with me, I don't know what she'll do.
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.460]   I can tell you to not be overcome
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.780]   by fear and by sin.
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.520]   Because I love you.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.700]   I've redeemed you.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.460]   And I've left you here to fulfill
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.800]   what is lacking in my sufferings.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.700]   What that means is Jesus isn't here physically anymore.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.860]   Jesus paid for the sin and death of the world.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.440]   And now his spirit indwells those who believe
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.780]   and we are the people that are to carry on
[00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:49.660]   while the serpent still hisses rebellion against God.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.420]   Watch why you can approach him.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:56.020]   Hebrews four, verse 14 says,
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.540]   therefore, since we have a great high priest,
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.420]   speaking of Jesus, who has passed through the heavens,
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.260]   Jesus, the son of God, let us hold fast to our confession.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.580]   For we don't have a high priest who can't sympathize
[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.500]   with our troubles, with the crushing stone
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.340]   that is heavy upon us, but one who's been tempted
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.460]   in all things as we are, yet without sin.
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:18.420]   Therefore, let us draw near with confidence
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.460]   to the throne of grace, that we might receive mercy
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.460]   and find grace to help in a time of need.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.620]   Do you know what's so amazing?
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.300]   My God understands how hard it is to be a guy
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.720]   who lives in a world where the serpent is still winning.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.900]   He knows how scary it is.
[00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.820]   He knows how overwhelming it is.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.260]   He knows what it's like to live in unmixed hell.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:43.520]   And he says, stay strong, take heart.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.300]   I've overcome the world.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.300]   This momentary light affliction.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.820]   Will soon pass away.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.600]   And there will be a greater glory.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:55.940]   But Todd, walk with me.
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.720]   You be a source of grace to others.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.700]   You tell people of my kindness and love for them.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.160]   Look what it says down there in chapter five,
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.000]   in verse seven and eight.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.860]   It says, in the days of his flesh, talking about Jesus,
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.660]   he offered up both prayers and supplications
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.380]   with loud crying and tears to the one
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.060]   who was able to save him from death.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.460]   And he was heard because of his devotion to God.
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:20.060]   Just like you should be, Peter, James, John, church.
[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.420]   Be watchful and pray.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.340]   Watch this.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.640]   Although he was a son,
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.860]   he learned obedience from the things which he suffered.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:36.500]   What that just simply means is this,
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.900]   is that God learned something when he was on earth.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.480]   How can the omniscient one learn something?
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.740]   God has never experienced what it's like to not be God
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:47.140]   until he decided to not regard equality with God
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:48.020]   a thing to be grasped.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.180]   And he learned how hard it was to be a man.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.380]   Now he knew that intellectually.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:59.320]   But I'm here to tell you, he experienced it personally.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:04.400]   And he also experienced the wages of your sin.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.700]   The thing which horrified Jesus more than anything else
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.740]   was the possibility that he could be separated from God,
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.580]   even from a moment.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:13.260]   What's amazing is that some of you guys here,
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.740]   you're not only just worried about not being separated
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.580]   from God for a moment,
[00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.540]   you've never done business with God once.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:20.660]   And what I'm gonna tell you is that right now
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.500]   is your heaven.
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.300]   This isn't hell for you, this is your heaven.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.740]   Because the grace of God is at work.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.800]   There are people of God who are bringing healing and hope
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.940]   and singing songs and who aren't evil towards you.
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:30.620]   There's grace at work all around this world.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.820]   If you're separated from God, you need to know something.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.100]   You're experiencing your heaven and you're about to,
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.400]   if you die apart from God's provision for your sin,
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.100]   you're about to experience the torment
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.400]   that Jesus was afraid of for a moment forever.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.460]   And so today is the day of salvation for you.
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.100]   Today is the day that you've gotta say,
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.260]   hey listen, I better respond to this love of God.
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.460]   I better learn from Jesus to be watchful and pray.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.420]   First of all, to watch my sin before God
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.540]   and know it deserves judgment.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.860]   I better pray for forgiveness and I better accept Jesus
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.020]   as the means for my forgiveness.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.860]   And then for those of you that have already said
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.420]   that you've accepted Jesus' forgiveness,
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.780]   you are going to be overwhelmed
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.820]   and you're not going to be faithful and on watch
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:11.180]   if you don't maintain an abiding relationship with him.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.980]   Don't tell me your passion's gonna get you through, Peter.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.300]   You watch and pray.
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.420]   You run with his people.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.060]   We're gonna give you a chance to do that here
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.820]   in community with other believers in just a moment tonight.
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:24.460]   But I wanna close by giving those of you
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:28.420]   that have never trusted in God to do that tonight.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:31.980]   Because what you see in Jesus' suffering here
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.880]   is you see a glimpse of how the omniscient, perfect,
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.060]   all-wise one knows how horrible it is
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.660]   to be separated from God for an instant.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.700]   And if you've never been reconciled to God,
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.860]   then you are still judged already
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.460]   and are destined to eternal separation from him.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.220]   And there is nothing on earth
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:50.260]   which can give you a real taste of that.
[00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.820]   We don't know what unmixed hell looks like.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:55:00.660]   Nice, Paris, Orlando, Dallas, Baton Rouge,
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.580]   your rape is just a taste.
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:13.160]   And God wants to rescue from that.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.520]   And the only way he can do it is through Jesus.
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.560]   Father, I pray that there's anybody in this room
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.660]   that has never really understood your love,
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.800]   your kindness and your goodness and your willingness
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   to experience what it's like to be a man in a world
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.020]   not run by the perfection of heaven.
[00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:41.960]   But because you came and you didn't regard equality with God
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.760]   a thing to be grasped, but you emptied yourself
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.920]   and you took on the likeness of a man
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.120]   and being found the appearance of a man,
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.440]   you humbled yourself and you gave yourself
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.820]   after knowing what was coming,
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.260]   you just said, okay, Lord, I'm gonna go.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.640]   I'm gonna let the wrath of God be poured out on me
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.760]   because I love Todd Wagner,
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:59.000]   because I love all those folks who are gonna be at the porch
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.040]   on July 19th, 2016.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:06.000]   I'm not gonna run the snake out of earth yet
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.240]   because there's still some people
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.160]   that have his venom running through their blood
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.200]   and I wanna deliver them
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.040]   and I wanna rescue them,
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.520]   I wanna give them the antidote to sin,
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.400]   which is the blood of Jesus Christ,
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.800]   that they would appropriate into their life
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.240]   because in humility, they would cry out,
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.680]   oh God, forgive me.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.800]   That cross that you went to, that's my cross.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.000]   That death that you experienced, that's my death.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.140]   The fangs that pierced you were my sin and my choices.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:36.240]   And so Lord, I thank you that you and your kindness
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.360]   have not done away with mass shootings and terror yet
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.160]   because if you did away with all terror,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.800]   you would have done away with me.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.080]   And so Lord, I come to you as a person
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   who has acted in rebelliousness and terror and mass sin
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.000]   and I ask your forgiveness.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.640]   And I don't know why you would choose to love me,
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:59.640]   but Lord, I hear this story, I hear you did,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:00.960]   that you demonstrated your love for me
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.000]   and that while I was yet a sinner,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.500]   you went to the cross for me.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:08.160]   Lord, thank you that Jesus was watchful
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.340]   and prayerful for me.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:13.660]   That he could be sin on my behalf.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.580]   Would you help me now, along with the other believers
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.540]   in this room, to abide with you, to continually pray,
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.580]   to not to have a fit of fervor,
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.900]   say I'm gonna walk with you forever,
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.660]   but to in a fit of wisdom, humble myself continually
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:30.560]   with God's people to remain on watch.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:34.080]   Would our faith make us strong
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.980]   and would our God be glorified as a result in Jesus' name?
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.740]   Amen.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.580]   (congregation applauding)
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:42.700]   So that God, he just says, look, I am who I am.
[00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.580]   I've always been God, I always will be God.
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:46.260]   You can trust in me.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:49.120]   Here's what we do is we're watchful and pray.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.420]   We keep reminding ourself, we encourage each other
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:54.060]   day after day, as long as it's called today,
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.660]   so we'll be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:59.060]   by the venom of the one who says God's not good,
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.340]   his word's not true, you can't trust him.
[00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.300]   Disobeying him is not that big a deal.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.100]   It's a big deal.
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:06.400]   It'll cost you everything.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.620]   And if you've trusted in him,
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:12.780]   it'll cost others who God intends to hear,
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.500]   you lift up the song of God to them from hearing.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:19.500]   And a loving father does not take kindly to people
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:23.040]   who he asks to sing who remain mute.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.520]   He says, their blood's on our hands
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.220]   when we take the antidote and don't share it with others.
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.780]   The psalmist said it this way,
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.420]   don't be envious of evildoers.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.020]   Do not fret because of evildoers.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:36.860]   Don't be envious of wrongdoers,
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.940]   for they will wither quickly like the grass
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.060]   and they will fade like the green herb.
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.580]   Instead, trust in the Lord and do good.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:48.220]   Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.220]   Delight yourself in the Lord.
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:55.120]   Seek him and be watchful and pray.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:56.900]   And only when you are reconciled to him
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.580]   will you have that peace that Jesus was heartbroken
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.940]   that he was gonna lose for a moment.
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.860]   He'll give you what your heart desires,
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.940]   love and light and life and hope.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.860]   But you've gotta come.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:09.760]   You've gotta sing.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.300]   And Jesus doesn't want you to do that alone.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:14.420]   That's why we have community groups here.
[00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.500]   If you're not connected to a church,
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.780]   would you connect with us?
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:18.200]   Tonight we've got open community groups.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.860]   Guys, there's gonna be a sign
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.140]   that just points you right down that way.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.220]   This little room right around this direction
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:24.500]   is an open community group for guys.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.580]   That way you can just walk in and say,
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:26.620]   man, I gotta find some other guys
[00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.760]   who can be watchful and pray for me.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.940]   Girls, you can head that way.
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.260]   If you're here as a college student, man,
[00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.420]   we wanna build into you while you're here for the summer.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.740]   Some of you guys are gonna be with us all year
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:35.040]   and we're gonna keep meeting with you.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.500]   But on the second floor of the tower,
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.560]   you just go up to the second floor
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:39.460]   and you walk straight across that little bridge
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:40.300]   that goes across.
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.000]   There's gonna be folks over there just to hang out with you
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.420]   if you're the college age group tonight.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.460]   So you go over there and you start to encourage each other
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.900]   the remaining days that you're here
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.280]   and make plans for going back
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.560]   and finding folks to be faithful there.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.340]   If you've never come to the one who came for you,
[00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:55.680]   would you come up here and let us talk to you tonight?
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.780]   Open community groups, guys.
[00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:57.740]   Open community groups, girls.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.100]   College, second floor of the tower.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.060]   All who are weary and heavy laden
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.940]   and who have venom of death and sin running through them,
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.860]   would you just come right here?
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.880]   Come to Jesus.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.860]   God bless you guys.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.780]   Be filled with his spirit, not your passion.
[01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.740]   By the grace of God, go and have a great week of worship.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:15.580]   We'll see you.
