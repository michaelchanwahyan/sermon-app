 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,880
 Well, what's up, Porch?

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,480
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,080
 Hey, it's good to see you.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,640
 Welcome.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,840
 So glad you made it.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,200
 If this is your first Tuesday ever with us, thank you for

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,480
 trusting us with your Tuesday night.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,640
 I'm so glad that you are here.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,280
 The Porch really exists to help any and every young adult

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,360
 see Jesus and surrender fully to him.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
 And I hope that that is true for you tonight.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
 I want to say hello to everyone watching online on

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
 all of our Porch Live locations.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,440
 So I'm thinking about Porch Live Fort Worth watching

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,160
 tonight, and Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Midland.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,640
 Thank you for tuning in.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,640
 Hope that all is well wherever you are.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,440
 So about four years ago, I got a phone call from my wife

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,760
 with some bad news.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,880
 Now, let me preface and just say that I asked my wife if I

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
 could share this story.

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,560
 So check that box off.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,960
 She called me and said, hey, I hit a car in the parking lot

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
 of HEB in College Station.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,240
 And she had hit a parked car.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,480
 And so I went up to HEB, to the parking lot.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,560
 And it turns out that all of the parking spaces were

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,320
 slanted because it's only one way, and so all the spaces are

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,880
 slanted.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,040
 Well, instead of reversing out of her space to leave the lot,

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,000
 she decided to pull through the open spot in front of her and

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,440
 turn right.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,000
 Well, the problem was she cut it too short, and she just

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,320
 totally caught the end of the car that was parked slanted.

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,200
 And so she cut it too close, and so the entire back half of

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,440
 our minivan got crunched.

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,720
 And then the back corner of the car that she hit

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,480
 just got mangled.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,240
 The worst part about the story is the car that she hit was a

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,480
 Maserati.

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,200
 And if you don't know anything about cars, she just hit the

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,440
 most expensive car in the parking lot, and she did $7,500

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,640
 worth of damage to that Maserati.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,560
 I tell you that because what my wife thought in the moment

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,400
 was this is a good path forward.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,760
 Like this will work.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,520
 It's not the right way to do things, but it's a way that a

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
 lot of people do things.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,880
 And so I'm just going to pull forward in a way that I'm not

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,360
 supposed to, but most people do it anyway, and it's not a big

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,280
 deal.

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,840
 And in the end, that choice, which seemed like a small

54
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,880
 choice going the wrong way, led to a lot of unnecessary pain.

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,240
 And I tell you that because I wonder if I'm now not

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,800
 describing my wife hitting a Maserati, I wonder if I'm

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,160
 describing you.

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,480
 Because there can be this tendency in us to find our way

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,520
 to unnecessary pain.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,440
 I want to draw a distinction tonight between unavoidable

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,960
 pain and unnecessary pain.

62
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,880
 Unavoidable pain is the pain that will normally and

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,680
 naturally come from living in a broken and busted world.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
 You will not have to go looking for this pain.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,040
 It will just find you.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,400
 And so there will be days and weeks and months that are very

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
 painful, not because of anything you've done, but

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
 simply because that is the reality of living in a broken

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,120
 and busted world.

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,960
 Unnecessary pain, on the other hand, is 100% avoidable.

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,400
 It's 100% avoidable.

72
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,000
 Unnecessary pain comes from making what seems like small

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,240
 decisions to head in the wrong direction, but you head that

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,600
 wrong direction because you look around and everyone else

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
 is heading in a wrong direction.

76
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
 Because everyone else is heading in a wrong direction,

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,760
 that must make it a right direction.

78
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,720
 But in the end, it leads to unnecessary pain.

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,200
 This is a topic that I'm very passionate about.

80
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,280
 Because after I graduated from Texas A&M University, the two

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,480
 years post-college that I was living in Dallas, I would say

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,000
 that I found my way into significant unnecessary pain

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,960
 because I made a lot of compromising decisions that at

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,360
 the time seemed right because a lot of other people make

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,880
 decisions just like that.

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,480
 But in the end, it was like pulling through a space and

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,400
 cutting the corner too tight.

88
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,840
 And it was costly.

89
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,400
 And if you're like, well, what does that even mean?

90
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,960
 Well, what I mean is I was actually

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,160
 working at this church.

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,320
 And I had to confess sin to a staff of 50 or 60 people.

93
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,080
 And I lost my job.

94
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,800
 I stepped off staff because I was living a life that was not

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,240
 congruent with what I proclaimed to believe.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,360
 My beliefs and my behavior didn't match.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,920
 It was extremely costly.

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,320
 My life, I would say, hit rock bottom in a lot of ways.

99
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,040
 And so what I want to do tonight is I want to step back

100
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
 into the book of Ecclesiastes.

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,840
 I hope that you've enjoyed journeying through this book.

102
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,000
 What I hope Ecclesiastes has been for you is a pleasant

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,840
 surprise where you're like, I have spent zero time in

104
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,160
 Ecclesiastes.

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,880
 And now that we've been studying it, I see just how

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,200
 relevant to our lives it is.

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,560
 Like Ecclesiastes chapter 10 is where we're

108
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,800
 going to be tonight.

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
 And I would say I can't think of a better chapter that is

110
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,880
 more relevant to the life of people in their mid-20s, late

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,320
 20s, early 30s.

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 This chapter is for you.

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,360
 And we're learning from King Solomon, who was in a lot of

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,160
 ways the richest and wisest person to really ever walk the

115
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,880
 face of the earth.

116
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,040
 And he's writing Ecclesiastes later in life.

117
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,480
 And so we're basically reading his journal entries as he

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,000
 looks back and just speaks from his experience.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,800
 And Solomon was a guy who experienced some unnecessary

120
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,240
 pain in his life.

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,840
 And so my hope tonight is that this might be a defining

122
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,040
 moment for some of you.

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,800
 That some of you, as we talk from Ecclesiastes, the Lord

124
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,680
 might grab hold of your heart and just say, don't take

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,040
 another step forward in that direction.

126
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,280
 It's not worth it.

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,560
 You think it's going to lead to life, and it won't.

128
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,180
 And it's going to land you in a place where you find

129
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,640
 yourself saying, what was I thinking?

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 It's not worth it.

131
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,040
 You don't want to get to your late 20s or your mid-30s and

132
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,640
 look back at your mid-20s and say, what was I thinking?

133
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,280
 I needed a mentor.

134
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,640
 I need someone who could have just spoken into my life and

135
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,480
 just said, nope.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,240
 And so I want to be that person for you tonight.

137
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,840
 I want to take the word of God because I believe that these

138
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,240
 are God's words to us.

139
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,280
 He speaks to us when we open up this book.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,120
 It's like we are opening up his mouth.

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,760
 And God spoke through an imperfect person named

142
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,920
 Solomon to us.

143
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,320
 So if you have a Bible, turn there.

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,040
 And my premise tonight is simply this.

145
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,200
 Unnecessary pain is 100% avoidable.

146
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,760
 It's 100% avoidable.

147
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,320
 And as we look at this text, I'm just going to show you

148
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,280
 several steps to take to avoid unnecessary pain.

149
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 The first one, the first step to avoiding unnecessary pain

150
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,160
 is this, sweat the small stuff to avoid unnecessary pain.

151
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,760
 Sweat the small stuff to avoid unnecessary pain.

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,120
 Listen to what verse 1 says in Ecclesiastes chapter 10.

153
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
 It's a very interesting imagery.

154
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,080
 It says this, "Dead flies make the perfumer's ointment give

155
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
 off a stench.

156
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,440
 So a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor."

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,120
 What a picture.

158
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,640
 So I just want you to think about dead flies floating

159
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,200
 around in your bottle of Le Labo Santal 33.

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 I don't know if I even pronounced that right.

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,080
 But, or Tom Ford cologne.

162
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,160
 Just imagine, like you pull it out and you look in it.

163
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,520
 And like there's flies in that thing that you dropped a lot

164
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,200
 of money on.

165
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,480
 And it's no longer the fragrant scent that you thought you

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,520
 were purchasing.

167
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,320
 There's a stench to it.

168
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,160
 And what Solomon's point is this, his point is a little bit

169
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,080
 of bad in your life can actually ruin a whole lot of good.

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,920
 And I don't know if you saw his wording.

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,560
 Look at the end.

172
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,480
 He says, "So a little folly," and folly is just a term that

173
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,680
 means to lack sense.

174
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,320
 He's saying a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.

175
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,480
 So he says, "Guys, I want you to picture a balance scale.

176
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,520
 And you drop honor and wisdom on the scale.

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,040
 And it drops because that's a weighty thing."

178
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,000
 And then he says, "But you just drop a little bit of folly

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,760
 and you know what it does?

180
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,080
 It tilts the scales."

181
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,680
 Which is really surprising because you would think that

182
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,680
 wisdom and honor always outweigh.

183
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,960
 And they're very valuable.

184
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,680
 And yet Solomon is saying that is how powerful folly is, that

185
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,280
 just a little bit of it, a little bit of bad can ruin a

186
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,400
 whole lot of good.

187
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:40,000
 We moved into a house last September and we bought a house

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,520
 that had been completely gutted and redone by a guy who does

189
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
 excellent work.

190
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,760
 And so we moved into a house that felt completely new.

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,560
 I mean the walls were perfect white.

192
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,720
 Everything was so, it was immaculate.

193
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,640
 He did such an incredible job.

194
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,040
 And so we loved stepping into this brand new space.

195
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,000
 And then one day I'm walking down the hallway that goes to

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,680
 the garage and there's just a big puddle of water on the

197
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,200
 floor in our brand new hallway.

198
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
 And so like I am very unsettled.

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
 I'm like, "Where is this water coming from?"

200
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
 Because I'm like, "Is it coming from the washing

201
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,600
 machine?

202
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,080
 It's not coming from there."

203
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,160
 I'm trying to locate where this water is coming from.

204
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,960
 And I open up the door to our laundry space and I can see on

205
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,400
 the trim of the door there is a small bead of water coming down

206
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,440
 the trim and then on to the ground.

207
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,000
 And I call the guy who remodeled our house and I said,

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,920
 "I don't know where this thing is coming from."

209
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,360
 And so he came over to our house and you know what he

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,000
 found? What he found was there was one nail that was missing

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
 from a shingle on the roof.

212
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,240
 And when it rained, the rain was just slipping through that one

213
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,600
 small nail hole.

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,080
 But over time enough water was coming through the attic into

215
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,040
 the laundry space, down the trimming and onto the ground.

216
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,320
 And because the water worked its way into the trim, the brand

217
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,200
 new trim was cracking apart.

218
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,960
 And I tell you that just to say all it takes is one small hole

219
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,560
 in your life.

220
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,560
 It just takes one small leak to crack really good character.

221
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,040
 A mentor of mine, it might sound cheesy but I will still never

222
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,600
 forget this, he said it in college, he just said, "Small

223
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,640
 holes sink big ships."

224
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,720
 And for some reason that stuck with me and I wish that I had

225
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,240
 heeded that advice because post-college and honestly in

226
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,800
 college, you know what the small leak was for me?

227
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,760
 I was a guy that was pursuing the Lord, I was chasing after

228
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,440
 the Lord, I was spending time in His word, I was leading in

229
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,360
 ministry in college.

230
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,760
 But do you know what the crack was that was in my character?

231
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,840
 The crack was that I had this insecurity in me and I would

232
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,440
 fill that insecurity by leading girls on.

233
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,400
 And now girls are like, "I hate that guy."

234
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,560
 Well, the Lord has changed my life and I've called those

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,640
 girls and I've apologized to them.

236
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,520
 But that was my tendency is I would be extremely flirtatious

237
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,880
 and then when I knew that a girl was interested, then I was

238
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,920
 just done with it.

239
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,920
 And what happened was it cost me my reputation.

240
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,120
 I still remember calling this girl to apologize and she

241
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,840
 answered the phone and she was like, "Now, T.A., why would you

242
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,040
 be calling me?"

243
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,040
 And I could just hear the bitterness in her voice and I

244
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,920
 just said, "I just need to ask your forgiveness because I led

245
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,560
 you on."

246
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,840
 But what happened was there was a stench around my name even

247
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,520
 though I considered myself a good Christian guy.

248
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,840
 True story, one of my closest friends that's a girl actually

249
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:18,920
 warned my wife about me before we started dating because she

250
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,600
 said that I was, and get this, I didn't even know this was a

251
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,320
 thing, but she was like, "He's kind of a Christian player."

252
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,880
 What?

253
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,840
 Those two words should never be put together.

254
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,120
 And if that's you, come down front.

255
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
 You need a mentor.

256
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,120
 I'd love to help you.

257
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,280
 But the problem was there was a slow leak in my life and that

258
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,160
 slow leak led to major cracks in my character.

259
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,200
 And so I just want to ask you, like, what is it for you?

260
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,720
 Where is there a slow leak where you keep pushing play on it

261
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
 thinking that it's not a big deal?

262
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,200
 But if you let that leak go, at some point you're going to find

263
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
 the house of your life flooded.

264
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,880
 Like it might not be next week, it might not be next month, it

265
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
 might not be next year, but at some point you're going to wake

266
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,520
 up underwater and look back and think, "How did I get to this

267
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,840
 place?"

268
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,640
 So here's my point, to come back to the point, sweat the small

269
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
 stuff.

270
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,000
 Like, sweat the small stuff in your life.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,280
 Don't just explain sin away as it not being a big deal or it's,

272
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,120
 you know what, it's just a little bit of porn every once in

273
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,240
 a while when I'm feeling lonely or it's just a little bit of

274
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,360
 weed on the weekends or it's just a little bit of hooking up

275
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,520
 every once in a while or it's just a little bit of credit card

276
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,360
 debt or it's just a little bit of lying or exaggerating because

277
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,000
 I'm trying to establish a friend group here or it's just a little

278
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,400
 bit of starving myself before special occasions.

279
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:12,320
 I'm just letting you know, those little bits turn into lots of

280
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,560
 pain.

281
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:21,360
 And so I just want to lovingly tell you, sweat the small stuff.

282
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,160
 Sweat the small stuff.

283
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,280
 Jesus Christ, he left heaven and came to earth.

284
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
 Why?

285
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,200
 John 10 said, Jesus actually said, "I came."

286
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
 If you want to know why I came, if you don't know what Jesus is

287
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,360
 about, here it is.

288
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,760
 Jesus actually said, "I came that you might have life to the

289
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,600
 full."

290
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,800
 Jesus actually left heaven and came to earth so that we could

291
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,400
 be made whole, so that we could experience fullness of joy,

292
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,840
 fullness of peace.

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,640
 We could flourish.

294
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,360
 And yet what we want to do is we kind of want to pull through

295
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,400
 the parking space thinking that it's an okay way to go.

296
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,440
 But the scriptures say that there is a way that seems right

297
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,600
 to man that in the end, it's the way to death.

298
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,560
 And so Jesus came to save us from even small things.

299
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,400
 So if you're a follower of Jesus Christ, why would you run back

300
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,160
 to the things that Jesus had to die for?

301
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
 And so let me encourage you, sweat the small stuff.

302
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,360
 Number two, surrender your heart to avoid unnecessary pain.

303
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,560
 Look at what Solomon says in verse two.

304
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,040
 He says this, "A wise man's heart inclines him to the right,

305
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,800
 but a fool's heart to the left."

306
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,900
 So do you see what he's saying?

307
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,560
 He's saying, "Look, people who walk in wisdom and people who

308
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,460
 walk with no sense and folly, they go in two different

309
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:51,960
 directions.

310
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,900
 Like one goes to the right, one goes to the left."

311
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,500
 And just so you know, if you're not familiar with your Bible,

312
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,300
 the right is the position of favor in the Bible.

313
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,900
 Like going to the right is always the right way to go

314
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,460
 in the Bible.

315
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,740
 So for example, Jesus is said to sit at the right hand

316
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,860
 of the Father.

317
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:18,460
 In Matthew 25, at the final judgment, there's a parable where God separates

318
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,940
 the sheep from the goats.

319
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,900
 The sheep, which are those who inherit the kingdom of God,

320
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,340
 they are put on the right.

321
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,380
 And so what Solomon is saying is, "Look, which way you go in life,

322
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,340
 whether you walk in wisdom or you walk towards unnecessary pain,

323
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,700
 it is actually a heart issue."

324
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,980
 That's why he says, "A wise man's heart inclines him one direction,

325
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,620
 and then a man of folly, his heart inclines him in a

326
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,860
 different direction."

327
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,420
 And in the Hebrew, that idea of the heart, it's all-encompassing.

328
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,700
 It's a reference to your thoughts and your desires, your motivations,

329
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,420
 your emotions.

330
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,660
 And so there is very dangerous counsel out in the world today,

331
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,220
 which is simply, "You know what?

332
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,140
 Follow your heart.

333
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,420
 Like the heart wants what the heart wants.

334
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,380
 And so if that's what your heart is longing for, you should probably

335
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,620
 follow your heart.

336
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,940
 I don't know if you should follow your heart, honestly.

337
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,980
 The question is, before you follow your heart, the question is,

338
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,060
 have you surrendered your heart to Jesus Christ?

339
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,700
 Because when you surrender your heart to Jesus, he actually gives you a new heart

340
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,980
 with new desires and new motivations.

341
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,620
 But if you're operating with the old operating system, then Jeremiah 79

342
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,100
 explains it this way, "The heart is deceitful above all things,

343
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,460
 and it's desperately sick.

344
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,060
 Who can understand it?"

345
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,740
 Do you hear what that's saying?

346
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,420
 It's saying, "Look, this idea of following your heart,

347
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,260
 your heart will lead you to do some really dumb things.

348
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,620
 Your heart will tell you that the wisest thing to do is to call your ex,

349
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,740
 and you know that that ex is super toxic to your life.

350
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,620
 Your ex is toxic.

351
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,340
 Not all of your exes, but some of them are."

352
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,140
 And this is just me lovingly saying, "Don't call her.

353
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,460
 Don't text them.

354
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,860
 It's not worth it.

355
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,540
 Unnecessary pain."

356
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,980
 Okay.

357
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:40,860
 Your heart will also encourage you to hold on to bitterness and anger towards

358
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,700
 someone who has hurt you.

359
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,380
 Your heart will convince you that that is your right.

360
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,660
 That's what you deserve, is to hate them.

361
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,180
 And yet that bitterness will swallow you up and rob you.

362
00:20:56,180 --> 00:21:01,020
 Your heart will tell you that you need to spend money that you don't have so that

363
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,980
 you will be happy.

364
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,540
 So here's my point.

365
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,540
 Before you follow your heart, you need to surrender your heart.

366
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,180
 Surrender it to Jesus.

367
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,540
 And when I say, "Surrender your heart," you might be like,

368
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,860
 "What do you even mean by that?"

369
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,580
 Well, I just told you that the heart in Hebrew, it refers to the mind,

370
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,780
 the heart, the emotions.

371
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,740
 It's your being.

372
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,940
 It's to just say, "Lord Jesus, you're a king.

373
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,940
 You're not just savior.

374
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,460
 You didn't just come to save me from hell.

375
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:44,340
 You came because you have watched me be ruled by sin and you love me too much to

376
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,900
 leave me in that place.

377
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,180
 So instead of watching me be ruled by sin, you instead want to come and

378
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
 rule my life."

379
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,660
 And I say yes to that.

380
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,740
 You can rule my life.

381
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,540
 You're a good king.

382
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,020
 You came that I might have life to the full.

383
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,620
 So take my heart and have your way with it.

384
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,940
 So just be honest with yourself.

385
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,620
 I just want to ask you, which way has your heart been going this summer?

386
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,540
 Because you can't run to the right and the left at the same time.

387
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:21,180
 And so like if you feel like you've discovered some hybrid of Christianity,

388
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,060
 where it's like you can run in two directions and you can kind of like dabble

389
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:31,940
 in the small stuff, certain sin, you can drive in the wrong directions and yet

390
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,580
 still feel like you're in lockstep with Jesus, I would just say that you've found

391
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,620
 a form of Christianity that the Bible says doesn't exist.

392
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,100
 Galatians 2.20 puts it this way.

393
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,820
 Like when you have surrendered your heart to Jesus, Paul expresses it this way.

394
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,420
 He says, "I've been crucified with Christ.

395
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,900
 It's no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.

396
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,260
 In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved

397
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,820
 me and gave himself for me."

398
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,580
 He's like, "I realize Christ gave his life for me on the cross.

399
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:16,060
 So now I give my life to him and he has control of my heart."

400
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,460
 So if you want to avoid unnecessary pain, surrender your heart.

401
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,540
 Surrender your heart to avoid unnecessary pain.

402
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,500
 Number three, listen to counsel to avoid unnecessary pain.

403
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,980
 Look at what he says in verse three.

404
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:37,020
 He says, "Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense and he says to everyone

405
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
 that he is a fool."

406
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,180
 This is so interesting.

407
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:47,740
 He's like, "Just imagine you're at North Park and you're walking down one of the hallways

408
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,660
 of North Park and here's a guy like, 'Just everybody, I just want you to know I'm a

409
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,660
 fool.

410
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,900
 I just wanted you to know.

411
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,780
 Hey, what's your name?

412
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,780
 Christina, I'm a fool.

413
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,620
 Just wanted you to know that.

414
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
 Have a good day.'"

415
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,860
 It's just, it's a picture of someone walking down the road declaring to everyone that they're

416
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,020
 a fool.

417
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,300
 And he's not literally saying someone's walking down shouting it.

418
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,860
 He's just saying that the way a person is living is so obviously, it's so obvious that

419
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,880
 it's foolish that everyone is able to look and see like, "What are we doing here?

420
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,740
 What is happening?"

421
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:37,260
 There was a time in my past where I was in college and I got into a relationship with

422
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,580
 a really sweet girl.

423
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
 It was just the wrong relationship.

424
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,880
 So I'll tell you how it didn't go well.

425
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,260
 She did not like how I looked.

426
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,460
 I know that because she told me that.

427
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,840
 That's how you know that.

428
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,340
 So she had to make a decision.

429
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,780
 Did she want to break up with me or did she want to change me?

430
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,500
 She chose to change me and I chose to let her.

431
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,940
 And so we drove from A&M to Houston and she bought me all new clothes and got me a new

432
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,700
 haircut and new shoes and my life.

433
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
 Don't judge me people.

434
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,020
 That was a long time ago.

435
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,020
 I'm being honest with you.

436
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,660
 And along the way in that relationship she told me that she hated my name Timothy because

437
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,780
 it was weak.

438
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,540
 And I might have told y'all this before but the real kicker was she told me, she said,

439
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,860
 "You could be a male model if it wasn't for your legs."

440
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,780
 And I was like, "Thank you?"

441
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,780
 Now y'all are like, "What's wrong with your legs?"

442
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,740
 Well, you'll never know because I only wear pants now.

443
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:55,900
 Truly, I swim in jeans.

444
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,940
 But when that relationship ended, when that relationship – I see some people are like,

445
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,960
 "Oh, it's okay.

446
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,380
 I didn't marry her.

447
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
 It's fine.

448
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,680
 She's a great person."

449
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,680
 When that relationship ended, all of my closest friends were like, "Yeah, dude.

450
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,860
 We knew she was – that was not a good relationship for you to be in."

451
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:28,560
 I was like, "Why didn't you say something?"

452
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,100
 But like what were they saying?

453
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,280
 They were saying it was so obvious.

454
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,040
 Like you were walking in the way of a fool.

455
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,360
 You changed everything about yourself.

456
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,560
 And that relationship began to dabble in impurity.

457
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,040
 And they were looking and saying like, "What is happening?

458
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,960
 You're in a relationship that doesn't make sense.

459
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,620
 You're changing yourself.

460
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,920
 You're compromising your standards in the relationship.

461
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,860
 And this thing isn't right and it's obvious."

462
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:03,040
 And then fast forward to life after college, I did have some guys that stepped into my

463
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,920
 life when I was making compromising decisions and they just said, "We just – we want

464
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
 to encourage you.

465
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,720
 This is not the right way to head."

466
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,440
 And I ignored them.

467
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,780
 And I didn't listen to them.

468
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,620
 And the result was unnecessary pain.

469
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,040
 And then this past week, I watched the Johnny Manziel, Johnny Football documentary, which

470
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,560
 – because I went to A&M, I love Johnny Manziel and he was a really great thing for A&M, but

471
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,820
 I watched the documentary.

472
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,120
 And if you haven't seen it, like my heart kind of broke for him because I just wanted

473
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,600
 to put my arm around him and say, "Dude, don't pull through the parking space.

474
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 Don't do it.

475
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,660
 You are on a path that only leads to brokenness.

476
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,080
 And some of you are here tonight and you are bent.

477
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,160
 You are bent on doing things your own way.

478
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,660
 And I want to tell you what I have told young adults for many years.

479
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:08,280
 You are on a path that in the end will only lead to brokenness.

480
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,060
 And I will be here for you to help you put the pieces back together when you're ready.

481
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:20,940
 But you can make a decision right now to actually turn and pursue wholeness in Jesus.

482
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,620
 And so let me just encourage you.

483
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,700
 Some of you are in a place where you have friends speaking into your life.

484
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
 And they are doing it lovingly.

485
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,340
 They are saying, "Look, I don't know if she is the right person for you to be dating.

486
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,880
 I don't know if he is the right person for you to be dating.

487
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,420
 I don't know that it makes sense that you are cutting corners like you are at work.

488
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,660
 You are quiet quitting and that it just doesn't make sense with who I know you to be.

489
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:53,020
 And I see what you are doing on the weekends and I just know that that is in the end not

490
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,260
 who you say you are as a follower of Jesus Christ."

491
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,780
 And what they are saying when they tell you that is what they are saying is, "I love you

492
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:09,420
 enough to tell you that your life is shouting, 'I am a fool right now.'"

493
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,740
 And so they are just trying to say, "I love you and I want more for you.

494
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,460
 Don't, don't despise their rebuke."

495
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,980
 We have been saved, if you are a follower of Jesus Christ, one of the beautiful realities

496
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,420
 of the gospel is that we have been saved into a family with brothers and sisters.

497
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,620
 God speaks to His people through His people.

498
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,380
 God uses His people to speak to His people.

499
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,660
 Do not despise their rebuke.

500
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:48,420
 Do not reject the voice of God in your life through your friends.

501
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,100
 Now I want to speak to a very specific group of people in this room through verses eight

502
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
 and nine.

503
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,140
 Look at what Solomon goes on to say.

504
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,580
 He says this, and it has everything to do with the point that we are in right now which

505
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,260
 is listen to counsel to avoid unnecessary pain.

506
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,900
 He says in verse eight, "He who digs a pit will fall into it and a serpent will bite

507
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,100
 him who breaks through a wall.

508
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,940
 He who quarries stones is hurt by them.

509
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,440
 He who splits logs is endangered by them."

510
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,980
 What Solomon is talking about is he is talking about someone who is bent on doing wrong.

511
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
 How do I know that?

512
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,060
 Well, I know that because of this reference to digging a pit.

513
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,640
 Psalm seven actually gives us the commentary that helps us understand it.

514
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,460
 In Psalm seven, the psalmist says this, "Behold," listen to the wording, he says, "Behold, the

515
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,980
 wicked man conceives evil."

516
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,660
 He conceives evil.

517
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,700
 He's pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.

518
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,700
 He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.

519
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
 What is the point?

520
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,860
 He's saying, "Look, you know who digs the pit?

521
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,780
 It's the person that's full of mischief."

522
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,380
 Like they're bent on it.

523
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,000
 They are bent on doing wrong.

524
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,280
 And so what I want to do is I just want to speak for a moment to a group of people in

525
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,760
 this room, and you will know who you are.

526
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,000
 But what I have seen is I have seen some young adults who have been hurt by other people,

527
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,360
 whether they've been hurt by their parents, whether they're bitter because of a deep pain

528
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,340
 that they've experienced in their lives, so maybe you're bitter at God, maybe life has

529
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,580
 just been really, really painful and it seems like your life has been more painful than

530
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,940
 other people's lives.

531
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:48,560
 And so you've just kind of leaned into it, and because you're hurt, your aim is to hurt.

532
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,420
 Because hurt people hurt people, and so you're on this mission right now to get back at your

533
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,100
 parents.

534
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,800
 You're on a mission to get back at that guy, to get back at that girl, to get back at the

535
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,600
 people who spoke ill into your life.

536
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,920
 And so the way that you're doing it, though, is you are just driving your life into the

537
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,120
 grave.

538
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,720
 And you're making choices that in the end the person getting hurt the most by your choices

539
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,040
 are you.

540
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,920
 And so you're sleeping with everyone you can sleep with.

541
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,760
 And in the end what you're trying to do is you're trying to numb your pain and at the

542
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,960
 same time prove something to someone else.

543
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:41,120
 Or you're drinking yourself to sleep, and you're doing it as a demonstration to someone

544
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
 who has hurt you, and at the same time you're trying to numb yourself.

545
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:54,240
 And so let me just lovingly tell you, listen to counsel to avoid unnecessary pain.

546
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,500
 There is healing found in Jesus.

547
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:05,600
 You might never get justice this side of eternity for whatever hurt you're carrying.

548
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,920
 And yet I love, I've heard pastors talking about moving from being a victim to being

549
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
 a victor.

550
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,520
 And I would just say that that can be your reality.

551
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,160
 You don't have to live in that hurt.

552
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,340
 You don't have to drive your life into the ground to get back at somebody.

553
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,720
 And I would imagine that the majority of people in this room are like, "He's not talking about

554
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,280
 me and I don't know who he's talking to."

555
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,680
 But I would imagine that there are a few people here tonight, and it's like a phone call from

556
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,000
 heaven to your soul.

557
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And God is just reaching and saying, "Look, I love you.

558
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,640
 And I can bring healing.

559
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,940
 I can be the father you've never had.

560
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,040
 I can be the parent you've never had.

561
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,240
 I can satisfy the longings of your soul."

562
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,160
 Number four, seek wisdom to avoid unnecessary pain.

563
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
 Seek wisdom.

564
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,520
 Look at what, we're going to skip over to verse 10 now.

565
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,680
 Look at what Solomon says.

566
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:08,280
 He says, "If the iron is blunt and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength.

567
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,160
 But wisdom helps one succeed."

568
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
 Do you hear what he's saying?

569
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:16,120
 He's saying, "Look, if you've got a blade that's really dull, like you're going to have

570
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,520
 to work a lot harder to cut something.

571
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,720
 Smart people, you know what they do?

572
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,160
 They take the time to sharpen their tool so that it will be most effective when they're

573
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,340
 cutting."

574
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,880
 And so what Solomon is doing is he is comparing wisdom to a sharpened blade.

575
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,920
 And what he's saying is, "Take the time to seek out wisdom."

576
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,720
 What do I mean by seeking wisdom?

577
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,080
 Well, the good news is Job 12 actually tells us where wisdom is found.

578
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,240
 Listen to what Job 12 says.

579
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,880
 It says, "Wisdom is with the aged and understanding is in length of days.

580
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 With God are wisdom and might."

581
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,240
 He has counsel and understanding.

582
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,480
 And so let me just encourage you, one of the best things you can do during your young adult

583
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,400
 years is to spend time seeking out older men or older women who are a few stages ahead

584
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,080
 in life.

585
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:18,600
 Buy them lunch, buy them coffee, come prepared with a list of questions and a pad of paper

586
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:25,920
 and a pen, and sit there and utilize the time that they have.

587
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,960
 Like recently, there's some older men in the church that I've just reached out to and said,

588
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,200
 "Look, you've been at this church for a long time.

589
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
 I'd love to get to know you."

590
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,760
 So what I've done is I've showed up with a list of questions, because I don't want to

591
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,640
 waste their time just shooting the breeze.

592
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,360
 Like I hate small talk.

593
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,600
 And so I don't want to just show up and talk about the weather.

594
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,800
 Like I've got a list of questions I can learn from somebody who's a few stages ahead in

595
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,900
 life, in marriage, in parenting, in leadership.

596
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,200
 So I just want to encourage you to do the same.

597
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,960
 Seek out older men or women.

598
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,280
 Just say, "Can I buy you coffee?

599
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:11,080
 Can I have an hour of your time to come with questions to learn from you?"

600
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,560
 And then here's what I'd tell you.

601
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,920
 Solomon says, "With God are wisdom and might.

602
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,000
 He has counsel and understanding."

603
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,880
 God has made known His ways through His Word.

604
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,600
 And so one of the best things you can do is develop a really sweet relationship with this

605
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,160
 book.

606
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,000
 And if you're like, "I don't even know where to start."

607
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,560
 Well, you need to know tonight in the loft, like right after the porch.

608
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,680
 I am teaching a 30-minute course on how to study the Bible.

609
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
 And so come.

610
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,680
 Come spend 30 more minutes with us on how to study the Bible.

611
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,680
 But this is how we find wisdom.

612
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,120
 We find it in knowing God through His Word.

613
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,440
 Solomon says in verse 11, he says something interesting.

614
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,840
 He says, "If the serpent bites before it's charmed, there's no advantage to the charmer."

615
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
 What's his point?

616
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,520
 He's like, "Look, if you don't do the work to charm the snake before it bites you, what's

617
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:10,120
 the point of like honing a craft of charming snakes?"

618
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:17,280
 So the point is like, look, don't wait until you get bitten by unnecessary pain.

619
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,360
 Seek out wisdom now so you'll walk in wisdom.

620
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,880
 You'll find a path that leads to joy and flourishing instead of to pain.

621
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,000
 And then the next key is watch your words to avoid unnecessary pain.

622
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,920
 Watch your words to avoid unnecessary pain.

623
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,520
 Solomon says in verse 12, he says, "The words of a wise man's mouth win him favor, but the

624
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,840
 lips of a fool consume him."

625
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:52,360
 Another translation says it this way, "Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious."

626
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,840
 So his point is like, the way you talk will either show whether you're full of wisdom

627
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,260
 or full of folly.

628
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:05,820
 If you want to avoid unnecessary pain, then pay attention to how you talk.

629
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:14,880
 When I was a kid, there was this PSA by this animated character, Smokey the Bear.

630
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,160
 And Smokey the Bear was famous for saying, "Only you can prevent forest fires."

631
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:29,120
 And there was this commercial that came out where you see this forest fire raging.

632
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,640
 There's this fire raging, and then it's almost like someone hit the rewind button and all

633
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,880
 of the fire, all the smoke come back to one moment, and it's to one match.

634
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,720
 And the reason I tell you that is that one small match can burn a whole forest to the

635
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:54,000
 ground just like your one small tongue can burn your life, your relationships, your career

636
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,840
 to the ground.

637
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:03,240
 More today than ever before, like I am amazed at the keyboard courage people have.

638
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,400
 Like what people are able to type and post or hit send and then go to sleep and sleep

639
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,960
 like a baby, that's crazy to me.

640
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,200
 Because like newsflash, but you can lose your job because of your social media.

641
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,240
 Like people will look at what you post, they'll look at what you say.

642
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,960
 I'm amazed sometimes.

643
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,400
 I've taken my kids to sporting events and young adults that are standing around us just

644
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,120
 cussing like crazy, knowing that there are little kids right by them.

645
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:41,880
 What it shows is just the searing of the conscience and the heart that this is just the way we

646
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,000
 talk now.

647
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,040
 People use the tongue to lead people on just like I did.

648
00:39:48,040 --> 00:40:00,120
 I think about a friend who consistently lies or exaggerates, says things that are not true.

649
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,160
 Words destroy friendships, they destroy families, they destroy marriages.

650
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,220
 So Solomon's point is like, look, words from the mouth of the wise, they're gracious.

651
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,480
 Like you use your mouth to bring glory to God, you use your mouth to praise God for

652
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,120
 His gospel that He would love us so much that He would send His Son to die for us, to make

653
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,240
 a way for us into the family of God through His death, burial and resurrection.

654
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,840
 We use our mouths to encourage those who need encouragement, to lift up those who are weak

655
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,160
 or hurting.

656
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,840
 That's what the mouth should be used for.

657
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,080
 So I just want to ask you, is there anything you have set on fire lately with your mouth?

658
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,600
 You know what the good news is?

659
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,000
 Is by the power of the Spirit at work in you, you can use the same mouth to make things

660
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,600
 right.

661
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,320
 And I'd encourage you to do that.

662
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,080
 Solomon says the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his

663
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,640
 talk is evil madness.

664
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,920
 Do you see what that's saying?

665
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,320
 He's saying when you start talking it's foolish, when you finish talking it's just plain evil.

666
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,760
 It's like your mouth is just unraveling.

667
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,540
 And so I tell you that just to say pay attention to which way your speech is moving.

668
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,200
 The words of a fool spiral downward.

669
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,040
 They become more and more negative, more and more sarcastic, more and more sexual, more

670
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:29,000
 and more vulgar, more and more manipulative, more and more exaggerated, more and more gossipy.

671
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,460
 Verse fourteen, "A fool multiplies words though no man knows what is to be and who can tell

672
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,000
 him what will be after him."

673
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 You know what he's saying?

674
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 He's saying, "You know what a fool does?

675
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,360
 A fool talks about the future with certainty when there's no clarity."

676
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,120
 So this is like great advice.

677
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,920
 Don't talk about the amazing vacation you're going to take until it's actually booked and

678
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,160
 you have the money to pay for it and you're certain you're going.

679
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,600
 Don't talk about the relationship that you're in when you've only gone to coffee once and

680
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,520
 you really don't even know each other's last name yet.

681
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,280
 Don't talk about the car you're going to buy with the promotion you're probably going to

682
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
 get.

683
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,800
 Wait until you get the promotion to actually pull the trigger.

684
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,800
 The point is like fools talk about things that they know nothing about.

685
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:29,000
 And so I encourage you, watch your words to avoid unnecessary pain in them finally.

686
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,520
 This is going to sound harsh but grow up to avoid unnecessary pain.

687
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:39,960
 And I tell you that lovingly but because Solomon says it.

688
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,160
 Listen to what he says in verse 16 and 17.

689
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,840
 He says, "Woe to you O land when your king is a child and your princes feast in the morning.

690
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:55,600
 Happy are you O land when your king is the son of the nobility and your princes feast

691
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,880
 at the proper time and they feast for strength and not for drunkenness."

692
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,280
 And so he pictures two lands.

693
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,680
 One where the king is an adult but acts like a kid and just wakes up in the morning and

694
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,120
 starts partying with his friends.

695
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:21,840
 And then he pictures a king who's owned his responsibility and so he feasts at the right

696
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:28,920
 time and the reason he does it is for strength so that he can guard and protect his country.

697
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:34,480
 And then Solomon says in verses 18 and 19 he says, "Through sloth the roof sinks in

698
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,200
 and through indolence which is inaction the house leaks.

699
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,800
 Bread is made for laughter and wine gladdens life and money answers everything."

700
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,800
 Do you know what he's saying?

701
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,720
 He's like look, if your roof is caving in and you do nothing about it, you don't take

702
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,160
 responsibility, good luck with that.

703
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,440
 And then he says, "Do you want to know when you have bread to eat and wine to drink and

704
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,840
 money to buy things?

705
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,800
 It's when you work and you take responsibility and you move forward."

706
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,200
 And so I just tell you that to say like I don't know who needs to hear that.

707
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,840
 But like it's time to get going.

708
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,280
 It's time to own the fact that you're 27.

709
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,680
 It's time to own the fact that you're 31.

710
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,240
 And you can't keep acting like 16 year old when you're a 27 year old.

711
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,000
 And I say that like because you don't want to get to 40 and look back and like why did

712
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,120
 no one ever tell me?

713
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,720
 And so one of the best ways to avoid unnecessary pain is just by growing up and just taking

714
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,040
 responsibility of where you are at now.

715
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,120
 Do you want to know how things played out in the parking lot of HEB?

716
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,560
 You know it's interesting.

717
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
 I'm not proud of this.

718
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,320
 I showed up and I looked at how the woman parked and she parked over the line.

719
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,800
 And it was a parking space for parents with little kids but this woman was by her house

720
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,220
 and by herself.

721
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,800
 And so I showed up and I was like, I didn't take ownership.

722
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,400
 I was like, "Well, you know what?

723
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,880
 You see here you're over the line and so you know that's really not right."

724
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:29,040
 And I was trying to excuse the decision that had been made to pull through in the wrong

725
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,400
 direction.

726
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:38,520
 And so I started digging myself a hole and then finally I snapped into reality.

727
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,920
 And I called the lady and I said, "Look, we will do whatever we need to do to make this

728
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,080
 right."

729
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:51,480
 And the great news is a month or two later we got a letter from our insurance company

730
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,560
 saying we have paid out all the money.

731
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,520
 And I tell you that just to say, you know what?

732
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,960
 The worst place to be is in a place where you just keep trying to dig yourself out of

733
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
 a hole.

734
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,800
 You just keep trying to explain away why what you're doing makes sense or why it's right

735
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,040
 and you try and justify your behavior.

736
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,600
 The best place to be is just where you come to a place before God where you just say,

737
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,320
 "Look, the way that I'm going is wrong.

738
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,000
 I've pulled through the space in the wrong direction.

739
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,840
 I'm heading in a direction that leads to brokenness.

740
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,200
 The way that I've gone, it's wrong."

741
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,040
 And you know what the good news is?

742
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,120
 The price has already been paid for all of your failures.

743
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,920
 Jesus Christ came.

744
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,320
 He went to the cross.

745
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,080
 He paid for all of your failures to make a way for you and me to have a relationship

746
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,080
 with God.

747
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,720
 This whole passage is encouraging wisdom over folly.

748
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,680
 Well the writer of Proverbs who happened to be Solomon says in Proverbs 1-7, "The fear

749
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,560
 of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.

750
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,400
 Fools despise wisdom in instruction."

751
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,400
 You know what he's saying?

752
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
 He's saying, "You know where wisdom is found?

753
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,160
 It's found in fearing God."

754
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,600
 And then the Apostle Paul clarifies what, who that wisdom is.

755
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:22,520
 He says in 1 Corinthians 1-30, "And because of him you are in Christ Jesus who became

756
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:28,480
 to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption."

757
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,080
 Do you know what true wisdom is?

758
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,480
 True wisdom starts with you coming to a place where you realize that Jesus Christ is the

759
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,240
 way, the truth, and the life and no one comes to the Father except through him.

760
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,800
 But if you will put your faith in Jesus Christ, if you will surrender your heart to Jesus,

761
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,520
 Jesus Christ becomes to you redemption.

762
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:00,080
 Where all of your failure, all of your folly is taken from you, it's paid for by his death

763
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:06,520
 on the cross and his resurrection from the dead and you are given his righteousness so

764
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:13,200
 that you can live in a real, enjoyable, flourishing relationship with the God of the universe.

765
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,640
 If you don't know him tonight, that is where wisdom starts.

766
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,960
 That's where unnecessary pain stops and joy begins.

767
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
 Let's pray together.

768
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:35,680
 Lord Jesus, I pray that if there's anyone here tonight who doesn't know you, then I

769
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,840
 pray that right now in this moment that they would find you, Lord Jesus, to be true wisdom,

770
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,640
 the wisdom that their soul has been longing for.

771
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,120
 God, I pray that no one would leave here tonight feeling beat over the head.

772
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:55,920
 If anything, I pray that people would leave feeling loved, that they've heard truth from

773
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,200
 you, God, through Solomon.

774
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:05,560
 God, I pray that unnecessary pain would decrease and joy would increase in the lives of the

775
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,040
 people in this room.

776
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,080
 God, we need you and we love you.

777
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,040
 Do a work in our lives for your glory and for our good.

778
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,000
 In Jesus' name, amen.

779
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:26,000
