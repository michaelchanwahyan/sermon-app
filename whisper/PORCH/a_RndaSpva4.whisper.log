[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.040]   - What's up guys?
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.240]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.500]   Hey, if you're here in Dallas,
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.820]   I just wanna thank you for your patience
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.000]   in putting up with the parking.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.240]   And man, we got an amazing parking team out there though,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.740]   man, can we give those guys a hand?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.760]   If you're not here in Dallas,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.280]   you're in Fort Worth or Houston or El Paso or Tulsa
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.840]   or somewhere else tuning in around the world,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.720]   we wanna welcome you.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.880]   And so thank you for being a part of this movement.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.080]   Thank you for believing in the gospel in your city,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.440]   for wanting to learn from God's word in your city
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.720]   and changing the world with us.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.800]   And so that's what we're here to do.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680]   And so I'm always encouraged when I come out here
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.200]   and I see all of you because when I was in college
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.380]   and thereafter college, I was not walking with God.
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.020]   And I wanted to just pursue all the things in the world.
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.980]   And so that's where I was.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.460]   I wouldn't have been here candidly.
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.940]   And so I'm glad that you guys are.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.780]   And so as a part of that story,
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.580]   one time when I was in college, I got arrested.
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.420]   A true story.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.220]   It wasn't, not anything great,
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.100]   not that getting arrested is great under any circumstances,
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.460]   but not a super cool story.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.900]   I was just drunk, okay?
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.660]   And so public intoxication evidently is against the law.
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.700]   And so a police officer comes,
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.220]   wants to give me a breathalyzer.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.060]   I say no, and he throws me in the back of his sedan.
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.920]   And so with some hardware, with some bracelets.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.580]   And so he takes me to the jail
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.380]   and like as hard as I thought I was,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.700]   and just like, you know, confident as I thought I was,
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.780]   I was scared.
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.980]   It's not fun to go to a jail.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.660]   And so they like take you through this process,
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.100]   your mug shots, the whole deal,
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.580]   puts you in a cell.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.260]   I get to share a cell.
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260]   My new roommate speaks no English whatsoever.
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.340]   And so I don't know if he's a serial killer
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.880]   or what he's in there for, you know?
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   That was the first one.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.620]   I'm like, so what did you do?
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.300]   And he can't communicate back to me.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.180]   And so I'm like, that is unfortunate.
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.180]   And so you stay over there, I'll stay over here.
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.820]   And it was cold and it was gray and dark and everything.
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.140]   And so then this police officer comes over to me
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.180]   with the keys and everything, unlocks the door,
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.820]   slides the door open and says, come on.
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.620]   And I'm like, that's it, I'm out, you know, let's go.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.600]   And he goes, no, no, you gotta make a phone call.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.580]   You get to make a phone call.
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.140]   And I was like, that's a real thing?
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.940]   It is a real thing, by the way.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.980]   And so he's like, you get to make a phone call.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.940]   And I'm like, who, I'm telling this officer,
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.740]   I'm like, who am I gonna call?
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.820]   I'm not, I'm good, like, I'll pass.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.900]   Give my phone call to him.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.540]   And he goes, no, he goes, you need to make a phone call.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.380]   I said, sir, who am I gonna call?
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.340]   And he says, you need to call your dad.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.760]   And I was like, nah, I'm good, man.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.660]   I was like, I'll call your dad, you know.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.940]   I'm not calling my dad.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.740]   Like, why, I'm not gonna call my dad.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.140]   You know, what are you talking about?
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.020]   And so let's just push pause right there
[00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.340]   for just a second, okay?
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.020]   And so you feel the circumstance,
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.300]   you understand the situation.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.840]   Why didn't I want to call my dad?
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140]   Now, you can just think about that for a moment.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.940]   Like, everything that's going on right there.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.940]   Like, why did I not want to call my dad?
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.440]   And you can think of the list of reasons.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.780]   You could come up with the real list of things.
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.540]   I'm thinking, man, he's gonna be so disappointed in me.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.460]   Like, I don't wanna deal with that.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.620]   He's gonna be discouraged.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.700]   I don't wanna call my dad and get an earful.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.540]   You did what?
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.820]   I can't believe this, you know, I told you that.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940]   I just, I don't wanna do that, right?
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.460]   And then I'm thinking, man, my dad,
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.540]   he's dealing with other things.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.580]   He doesn't have time to handle this situation.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.980]   And then I'm thinking, my dad doesn't even know
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.680]   how to handle this situation.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.500]   Like, what's he gonna do?
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.180]   You know, he doesn't have a lot of money.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.580]   Like, I don't know how he's gonna get,
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.540]   not gonna post bond or bail or whatever.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.660]   Like, he, why would I call him?
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.380]   There's not anything that he's going to do.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.220]   In fact, he's just gonna do what he wants to do anyways,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.660]   right, these are the things going through my mind.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.360]   And then I'm thinking, you know what, I can handle this.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.680]   Like, you know what, I can keep this from them.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.540]   They don't ever have to know that I was in here.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.740]   We don't have to talk about it,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.420]   I don't have to deal with it, I can handle it.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.420]   And so for those reasons, I didn't want to go to my father.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.940]   And as you think about that,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.680]   I think these are the same reasons
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.220]   we don't want to go to our father, okay?
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.160]   I don't know what your day looked like today.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.300]   If you're here, you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.380]   if you are, if you trust in Christ,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.820]   you identify as a Christian, okay?
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.000]   You call yourself a Christ follower.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.840]   What that means is that a part of your day today
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.880]   was spent communing with God, talking with God,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.440]   conversing with God.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.920]   You spent some extended time in prayer,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.640]   both all the time, all your different circumstances,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.440]   and then probably at some point in your day,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.800]   you stepped away and said, hey God, it's just me and you,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.640]   I want to talk to you.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.320]   And if you didn't, you need to ask yourself why.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.080]   Well, why, and why would you assume
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.940]   that you're a Christ follower?
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.120]   Why would you assume that you have a relationship
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.800]   with God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.740]   you have access to him,
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.940]   and you didn't take advantage of that today?
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.520]   And if you start to wonder why you didn't,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.100]   and I'm gonna ask you, why didn't you?
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.000]   I think you're gonna come up with a really similar list.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.480]   Man, I just, I don't know, I've done some things.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.680]   God, he's gonna be disappointed in me,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.640]   he just feels far right now.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.920]   I mean, does he even care?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.980]   And he's got bigger things,
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.720]   I mean, there's children dying today,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.920]   and people starving,
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   and I'm not gonna come to him with my little,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.680]   and isn't he just gonna do what he wants to do anyways?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   Like, why would I pray?
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.440]   Isn't he just going to do his thing?
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.440]   And you know what, I think I can handle this stuff.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.080]   I got it under control.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.440]   And in fact, I asked you on social media,
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.960]   I just pinged you guys out there,
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.600]   and just said, hey, why don't we pray?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.840]   Why doesn't young adults pray?
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.400]   Why don't young adults pray?
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.040]   And you guys had some great responses, thank you for that.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   And so on Twitter, and Facebook,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.800]   and the social media I'm a part of,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.040]   you said that list, and you added to it two other things.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.600]   You said, because we're busy,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.400]   and because we don't know how.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.760]   And so let's just talk about that.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.160]   We're in this series talking about the remnant.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.160]   Let me define the remnant for you really clearly.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.640]   The remnant just means God's people.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.080]   And so we're talking about what God's people do,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   how we stand apart in this world,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.680]   how we're not a part of this world,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.480]   we stand in contrast to this world,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.160]   and what marks the remnant, what marks God's people.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.920]   God's people talk to God.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.720]   Simply put, the remnant are people who pray.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.160]   So if you're a part of the remnant,
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.480]   something that's normal to your life,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.880]   is that you converse, you have the privilege
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.840]   of conversing with the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.960]   And here's what I need you to know,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.920]   this is so important, lean in.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.560]   If you miss everything else tonight,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.280]   I want you to hear this.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.480]   God loves you.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.240]   He's not mad at you.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.520]   He's not disappointed in you.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.160]   And he's eager to talk to you.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.360]   He wants to converse with you.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.160]   He wants you, this is crazy what I'm about to say,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.000]   you ready?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.240]   He wants you to ask him for stuff.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.800]   Anything that is spinning around in your heart and your mind
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.440]   he wants you to go to him with.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.960]   He wants to hear about it.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.320]   He wants you to talk with him.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.840]   He desires that.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.080]   The scripture says this so many times
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.720]   in so many different ways, over and over and over.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.760]   And I think you're right when you say we don't know how.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.800]   We don't know how.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.720]   We're so weird about prayer.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.520]   We brought all this baggage in with us.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.480]   I don't know what your church background is,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.160]   but we're like, hey, I'm gonna do it.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.560]   Dear God, like I'm writing a letter.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.720]   Dear God.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.520]   And we just say silly things.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.080]   Like why do we do that?
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   And some of the things that we say aren't silly,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.920]   but we don't know why we say them.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:51.720]   We use the word bless, which means to make happy.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.320]   Lord, bless this food.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.640]   Make it cheerful.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.880]   Make it happy food.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.840]   And bless the hands that prepared it.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.200]   Make them happy hands.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:08.520]   And maybe you pray to saints.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.280]   Somebody told me the other day, a friend of ours was sick,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.520]   and they just said, hey, I'm sending thoughts your way.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.360]   As a Christian, I'm sending thoughts your way.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   What does that mean?
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.520]   Stop it.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.640]   Send prayers my way.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.480]   How about that?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.360]   I don't need your thoughts.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.040]   I'll take your prayers, right?
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.320]   And maybe you cross yourself.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.240]   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.960]   Or at the end, you say, in Jesus' name, which is fine.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.800]   That's fine you say that.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.240]   Do you know why you say that?
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.400]   Why do you say in Jesus' name?
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.720]   Is it just because everyone's always done that?
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.760]   Why do we do what we do?
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.360]   Let's learn how to pray.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.680]   The remnant prays.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.080]   If we believe that there's a God who loves you
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.760]   and he's eager to help, I think we'd pray more.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.520]   I think the reason that we don't pray,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.280]   the number one reason we don't pray
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   is we have a wrong perspective of God.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.840]   He's a Father who loves us, who's crazy about us,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.800]   and desires us to talk to them.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   And with prayer, I want you to know
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.000]   there is only benefit, no cost whatsoever,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.320]   only benefit to your life.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.800]   It is one thing, a very few things in this world
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.560]   that you can do that has zero downside, all upside,
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.520]   as you get to talk to the creator
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.440]   of the heavens and the earth.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.880]   As we move through this text in Luke chapter 11,
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.240]   we're gonna look at what is prayer,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.160]   how we pray, and why we pray
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.400]   before you leave here this evening.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.840]   Luke wrote this in about 59 AD.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.000]   He was not one of the apostles.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.160]   He researched the life of Christ and wrote it down.
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.600]   This is a very well-researched document,
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   the Gospel of Luke.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.200]   And so in prayer, I could've gone
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.040]   a lot of different places.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.720]   I could've gone 1 Thessalonians 5,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.000]   Colossians 4, Philippians 4, James 1,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.280]   James 4, James 5, Matthew 6,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.920]   Jeremiah, Isaiah, Ephesians 6.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.080]   But I went here because Jesus
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.320]   is going to teach us how to pray.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.280]   And he says this, it starts off,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.000]   "One day Jesus was praying,"
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.500]   so he's modeling it for us in a certain place,
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.920]   which is odd, okay, because he's been with God
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.060]   for eternity past.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.160]   He is God.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.560]   He's been with the Father eternity past,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.020]   but when he was here on this earth,
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.760]   he spent a lot of time talking to the Father.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.600]   And so that's something to take note.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.720]   And when he finished praying,
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.000]   one of his disciples said to him,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.360]   "Lord, teach us to pray just as John
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.880]   "taught his disciples," all so strange.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.400]   Because have you ever seen someone praying,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.440]   you're like, wow, you're really good at that.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   Will you teach me how?
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.280]   I mean, it's just not something,
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.120]   you might be like, hey, teach me how to shoot a free throw
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.640]   or something, but probably not.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.480]   Wow, I'm so amazed at your ability to talk.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.200]   Can you teach me how to do that?
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.480]   And so he said to them,
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.640]   "When you pray, say, Father."
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.800]   Stop right there.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:58.760]   He says, "I want you to address the creator
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.320]   "of the heavens and the earth as Father."
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.060]   Just that one word has so much depth and meaning.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:07.320]   But then he says, "Hallowed be your name."
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.160]   And he sets up this dichotomy
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.280]   that God is holy and set apart,
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.280]   that even his name is holy.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.600]   That's what hallowed means.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.880]   His name is holy, and yet you get to call him Father.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.160]   Give us each day our daily bread.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.200]   Give us what we need today.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.360]   Forgive us our sins,
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.200]   for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.440]   And lead us not into temptation.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.720]   And so he says, hey, this is how you pray.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.400]   You pray to the Father,
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.600]   and you tell him, or you ask him for things.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   He gives, he forgives, and he helps us.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.080]   We need to know that, that he gives to us,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.580]   he forgives us, and he helps us in this world
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.240]   with the problems that we encounter here,
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.460]   namely temptation.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:04.120]   And so my first point tonight, what is prayer?
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.960]   We're answering the question, what is prayer?
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.280]   It's accessing God as Father.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.040]   Prayer is accessing God as Father anytime.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.680]   You can access him as Father anytime.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   The remnant accesses God, the creator, as their Father,
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.880]   and they can do it anytime they want.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.460]   Friends, prayer, simply put, you're like, I don't know how.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.720]   If you know how to speak, you know how to pray.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.640]   If you know how to ask somebody for anything,
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.980]   you know how to pray.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.940]   You don't have to go somewhere special.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.400]   You don't have to use particularly careful words.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.920]   You can just say, hi, God, this is what's going on.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.240]   I need your help.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.800]   Can you show me this?
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.160]   Can you give me this?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   Can you help me understand this?
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:06.480]   Prayer is asking, it's confessing, it's thanking,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.960]   and it's worshiping or adoring.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.940]   You can just stop during the day and say, God, you're amazing.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.060]   You're so holy.
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.740]   You're set apart, you're sovereign, you're all powerful.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.060]   You amaze me, God.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.620]   Thank you for bringing the son up today, God.
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.020]   I'm going to work today.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.020]   In a car, God, it's amazing the way you've blessed me, God.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:39.180]   But Jesus says something profound here, guys.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.660]   He says, you get to call my daddy your daddy.
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.860]   16 times in the Old Testament, God is referred to as Father.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.200]   But all 16 times in the Old Testament,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.760]   it's like father of a nation, father of Israel.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.300]   It's like a generic kind of like our forefathers,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.140]   if you will.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.100]   And then Jesus shows up on the scene,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.900]   and Jesus calls him Abba.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.020]   He calls him Daddy, calls him Father,
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.740]   over and over, Father, Father, Father.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.140]   And then he shows up here, and he says,
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.580]   hey, you get to call my dad your dad.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.780]   He can be your dad.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.220]   It's a very personal thing.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.980]   And you know why you can do that?
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.660]   Because Jesus allows you to do that.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.620]   Remember when Jesus died on the cross and the veil was torn?
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.980]   Now you have access to God anytime.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.820]   Why?
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.980]   Because he's with you.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.220]   God's Holy Spirit is with you.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.520]   Anywhere you go, he's with you.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.800]   When you sit at your cube, he's with you.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.600]   Go into your office, he's with you.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.340]   Into your apartment, he's with you.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.220]   In the car, God is with you.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.500]   In the bathroom, God's there too.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.960]   And you can talk to him like he's right there.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.100]   You ever felt lonely?
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.320]   You're never alone.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.500]   God is with you.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.480]   Wherever you go, God is with you.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.160]   Hebrews 4, it says, because Jesus is now our high priest,
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.000]   that we, it says, let us then approach God's throne
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.320]   of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.560]   and find grace to help us in our time of need.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.360]   That Jesus is the mediator.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.880]   This is what this means.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.760]   It's like when I'm in that jail and I call my dad.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.460]   You know, and the phone's ringing and I'm there nervous
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.000]   because I've done something wrong and I've got to tell him
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.140]   I got arrested.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.120]   It's like Jesus answers the phone.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.960]   Hello?
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.720]   Jesus, can I talk to my dad?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.800]   Hold on a second.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.300]   Hey, it's your son and he's innocent.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.500]   Completely blameless, faultless.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.960]   He hasn't done anything wrong.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.660]   You remember I erased that?
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.340]   I paid for that.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.200]   That you literally get to talk to God today as blameless.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.560]   He doesn't look at you and see the pornography
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.600]   or the abortion or the identity in relationships
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   or that you stole or the words you used.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.920]   That he sees the payment in his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.080]   and you get to approach the father
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.000]   as a faultless, righteous child,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.440]   declared righteous through the son.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.320]   This is crazy.
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.880]   This is unbelievable.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.340]   In the gospel, this is what it means, friends,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.680]   to pray in Jesus's name.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.960]   That's why we add that on the prayer at the end
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.880]   when you say in Jesus's name,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.540]   and you don't have to say it,
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.240]   you can pray in the name of Jesus.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.320]   It's because of what Jesus did
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.280]   that you get to talk to the father.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.620]   You go to the father through the son by the spirit.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.040]   And so if you've trusted in Christ,
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.120]   then you get to come to God like a child.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.640]   Not like a child, like his child, and that's different.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.780]   I was speaking at a camp a couple weeks ago,
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.840]   and I took my son with me.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.560]   He's out of state, and I took my son with me,
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.280]   and they had someone watching him
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.920]   while I was speaking, and I went long,
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.200]   which is not crazy for me.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.360]   Sometimes that happens.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.840]   And so he got tired of waiting,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.640]   and for some reason, I don't know why,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.520]   but he thought that I left him.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.340]   And so he got scared.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.360]   He's five years old, and he just started crying.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.000]   He's thinking, "Daddy left him,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.640]   "and they wouldn't let him come to me."
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.400]   So he's pretty quick, and he just kind of made a break
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.980]   for it, and he got away, and he kind of ran across the camp,
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.360]   this five-year-old, by himself,
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.440]   and kind of stumbled into the chapel that I was at,
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.080]   and he came in, and they held him back
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.040]   'cause I was speaking, and they were like,
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.600]   "Hey, somebody's talking to you."
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.760]   And he's like, "That's my dad."
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.360]   And I know it was sad.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   And I finished, and then they brought him to me,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.740]   and they were like, "Hey, he wanted you,
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.760]   "but we didn't want to interrupt you."
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.280]   And I was like, "I'm not angry, but you don't have kids.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.300]   "If he wanted me, I'll let him come.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.160]   "Like, if they need me right now, I'm done."
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   I'm like, "D-Marv, come, step up.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.520]   "My family needs me."
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.080]   At any moment, at any time, regardless the situation,
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.080]   I'm available to my children, and I'm a bad dad.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.760]   Like, you know, I'm a good dad, but I'm a bad dad.
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.440]   I'm a sinful dad, I'm a fallen dad.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.520]   Your Father in Heaven, He's a perfect Father,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.880]   very different than your earthly father, a perfect Father.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.600]   He's so crazy about you.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.720]   He's crazy about you.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.640]   He's not disappointed in you.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.320]   He's thrilled about you.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.860]   And He just, more than anything He wants,
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.680]   if you know Him, if you have a relationship with Him,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.340]   He wants you to get to know Him more,
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.200]   and have a relationship with Him.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.900]   And so the remnant approaches the Father as His child.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.560]   Verse five, "Then Jesus said to them,
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.360]   "'Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.840]   "'and say, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread."'"
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.440]   A friend of mine, this is the next verse,
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.960]   the literal next verse, so He doesn't finish our Father,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.560]   right, He doesn't, "Our Father who art in Heaven,
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.400]   "hallowed be thy name.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.540]   "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.380]   "as it is in Heaven.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.240]   "Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.080]   He doesn't say that.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.840]   He says that in Matthew 6, but the reason He doesn't say
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.120]   that here is 'cause Jesus isn't telling us what to say.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.400]   He's not saying, "Hey, use these words."
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.800]   He's saying, "Hey, this is how you approach the Father,
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.280]   "with this spirit, with this attitude."
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.520]   Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.640]   and say, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.980]   "A friend of mine on a journey has come to me,
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.120]   "and I have no food to offer him."
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.160]   And suppose the one inside answers, "Don't bother me.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.720]   "The door is already locked, and my children and I
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.680]   "are in bed.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.360]   "I can't get up and give you anything."
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.400]   I tell you, even though He will not get up
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.040]   and give you the bread because of your friendship,
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.520]   yet, because of your shameless audacity,
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.600]   it says, "Shameless audacity, He will surely get up
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.680]   "and give you as much as you need."
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.280]   Shameless audacity there is the word anodia in the Greek.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.520]   It's one word.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.260]   He's saying, "Hey, this is why He's going to give it to you.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.420]   "So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.640]   "Seek, and you will find.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.520]   "Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.200]   "For everyone who asks, receive.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.960]   "The one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks,
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.080]   "the door will be opened."
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   This shameless audacity, the asking, seeking, finding,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.760]   has to do with your persistence.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.720]   He's saying, "You come to God persistently."
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.600]   Now, what He's not saying is, like,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.120]   if God has this magic number, and if you ask Him
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.320]   this magic number of time, then He's going to give it to you.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.640]   Like, once you ask 792 times, He's going to say,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.520]   "Okay, good, here you go."
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.240]   That's not what He's saying.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.920]   He's saying that because you believed
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.800]   that He could meet your need,
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.980]   right, you sat there at the door, you're like,
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.040]   "I need food, you got food.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.640]   "I'm not going anywhere,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.220]   "because I know you have what you need.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.340]   "I know you have what I need, rather.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.740]   "I have faith that you can meet my need,
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.660]   "and you're a father, so I'm staying here," right?
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.180]   And some of you said, "Hey, the reason I don't pray,
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.860]   "my mind wanders, I'm trying to pray,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.580]   "but my mind drifts, I get distracted,
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.440]   "my iPhone beeps, I get a text message that comes in,
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.860]   "you know, something happens, someone interrupts me."
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.500]   This is, this verse speaks to this,
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.620]   that you sit there, and you focus,
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.860]   and you fight to hold the thought in your head.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.820]   Psychologists have now said, even secular psychologists
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.360]   have said that this is good for the human,
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.820]   that it is a cure for anxiety, for panic disorder,
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.420]   it's a cure for obsessive-compulsive disorder,
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.100]   that it's a cure for depression.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.900]   They might call it meditation, or mindfulness,
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.220]   but that you would sit somewhere,
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.680]   and you would fight to hold a thought.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.500]   And if you're a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.200]   it's that you're holding a thought
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.540]   that God is who he is, and you're asking for him,
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.620]   and you're blocking out the rest of this world,
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.020]   you're putting your phone in the other room,
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.980]   you're making time to prioritize God.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.880]   And so how we pray?
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.660]   Inactivity and attitude.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.760]   How we pray?
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.040]   We pray inactivity and attitude.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.740]   The remnant prays inactivity and attitude, right?
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.260]   Jesus says, "This is how you pray," and then he prays,
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.220]   and then he models the attitude
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.520]   that God can give us our daily bread,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.920]   that we have an attitude of dependence,
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.680]   that we believe that he has what we need,
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.700]   that he can meet our needs.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.340]   So both in the activity and in the attitude,
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.540]   let me explain this with two quotes, actually.
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.300]   The first quote inactivity, this comes from Martin Luther,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.900]   he says, "I have so much to do today
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.540]   "that I will spend the first three hours in prayer."
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.740]   You see what he's saying?
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.340]   "I've got so much to do today
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.860]   "that I need to start by centering my life
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.740]   "with just me and God, spending time with him."
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.340]   This is normal for the believer, for the Christ follower,
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.700]   that tomorrow you would set aside time
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   where you don't do anything else but talk to God.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.780]   Can I tell you something?
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.540]   Test me on this.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.700]   It will be the single most productive thing you do tomorrow.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.140]   You will have gotten more done in that 30 minutes
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.740]   or that hour than any other time
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.660]   because who do you think's more effective,
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.300]   you, little old you,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.540]   or the creator of the heavens and the earth?
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.100]   So you can do it on your own
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.660]   or you can invite the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.540]   all-powerful God who says,
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.220]   "Call me Father to partner with you."
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.060]   Now the problem is we don't believe that.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.340]   It's the most productive thing that you will do.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.300]   The most important thing that you will do
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.980]   is talking to God tomorrow.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:19.220]   And so set time aside to talk to God.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.260]   And then the attitude, so that's activity,
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.100]   the attitude, and here's a quote,
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.300]   "I rarely pray for 20 minutes,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.500]   "but I rarely go 20 minutes without praying."
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.340]   That is this attitude of dependence
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.380]   that constantly I'm talking to God.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.260]   I know that I can trust him, that he knows better than me.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.500]   I believe that you can meet my need, God,
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.860]   so I'm remaining persistent even as I go about my day.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.580]   I'm constantly talking to you
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.860]   with an attitude of dependence.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.060]   You guys imagine, like whatever,
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.100]   like your boss comes in, leaves, you're frustrated,
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.100]   you're just like, you go to God,
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.020]   "God, help me to respond in the spirit."
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.340]   Relationship doesn't go as,
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.020]   "Well, Lord, help me to date in a way that honors you,
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.780]   "protect me from myself,
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.460]   "remove this from my life if it's bad for me.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.220]   "And Father, my heart hurts right now
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.060]   "because of what happened.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.500]   "Will you help me heal?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.540]   "God, I wanna do this this weekend.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.500]   "Is that good, is that smart?
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.100]   "I don't wanna do anything outside your will.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.580]   "I mean, my flesh, I really want to,
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.860]   "but I don't know if you want me to,
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.380]   "and I get the sense that you don't want me to,
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.460]   "but I really, really want to,
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.300]   "but if you don't want me to,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.260]   "please don't let me, okay?"
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.460]   It's okay, you can handle that kind of stuff.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.140]   You can talk to him just like that.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:37.220]   You should talk to him just like that all the time.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.980]   That that would be normal for your life.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.740]   And so Jesus, he did both of these,
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.060]   the attitude and the activity.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.020]   He would pray all the time.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.140]   We see that in the Gospels,
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:49.700]   but he would also have long prayers.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.100]   Luke 5, verse 16 says,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.820]   "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed."
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.140]   And so you guys told me that one of the reasons
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.620]   you don't pray is 'cause you're too busy.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.140]   If you're too busy to pray, you're too busy, period.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.020]   If you're too busy to pray, you're too busy.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.300]   Like you have to change something
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.340]   'cause life only gets busier, I promise you.
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.380]   There's not a person in the room
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.020]   who is going to disagree with me on that statement later.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.140]   It only gets busier.
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.300]   So you have to right now when you're 18,
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.300]   when you're 22, when you're 23, when you're 35,
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.900]   you have to prioritize prayer right now.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.060]   If you don't, you will not later.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.980]   And if we don't pray, we're taking God for granted.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.660]   Listen, prayer, you gotta hear me.
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.700]   Like, prayer works.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.140]   Like, prayer works.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.660]   I've heard it said that when we work, we work,
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.660]   but when we pray, God works.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.740]   Prayer, it's effective.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.620]   The Scripture even says it's powerful and effective.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.220]   Praying in the will of God is a really powerful thing,
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.380]   maybe the most powerful thing in your life.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:05.060]   I was in Disney World with another child recently.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.500]   I told you about it several weeks ago.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.700]   So my daughter and I got to go to Disney World
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.260]   and we went to Animal Kingdom and there's a ride there
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.660]   in Pandora, which is like Avatar land, it's pretty amazing.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.660]   And there's a ride there called The Flight of the Avatar.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.740]   And I heard it's incredible and I wanted to go.
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.540]   Anybody been in The Flight of the Avatar?
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.780]   Okay, good, yeah, you gotta know, it's awesome.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.260]   And so they told me, people who know Disney World said,
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:33.620]   hey, you gotta get there right when it opens
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.620]   and race to that ride if you want any hopes of riding it.
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.700]   And so we did that.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.940]   We got there at 9 a.m.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.580]   When the park opened, gates opened, we ran to the ride.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.580]   It's now 9.01 and I'm walking up and the line is four hours.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.980]   Four hours at 9.01, are you serious?
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.180]   And so I'm there and I'm like,
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.820]   we are not gonna spend half our day in this line.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.660]   I don't care how awesome it is.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.140]   And my daughter Finley, she's just,
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:02.980]   I'm like, what are you doing?
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.140]   She goes, I'm praying that we would have
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.980]   a FastPass to this ride.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.540]   FastPass, it's a thing at Disney.
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.460]   You can just go right on the ride.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.780]   But I'm like, baby girl, we don't have a FastPass
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.540]   because daddies that really love their children
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.980]   got on the app early and I didn't.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.180]   No, and I'm like, we don't have a FastPass, sweetie.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.900]   And she goes, well, that's why I'm praying that we do.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.580]   [congregation laughing]
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.060]   And I go, okay, well, let's go see what else there is.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.220]   She goes, no, no, let's go see if we have a FastPass.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.780]   I'm like, but I'm telling you, we don't.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.620]   And I walk up there, the guy there in the FastPass booth,
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.700]   you put your little bracelet on there
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.460]   and if you have a FastPass, it turns green.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.420]   I put my little bracelet up there to that Mickey
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.980]   and it turned red.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.220]   [congregation laughing]
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.140]   And I'm like, I told you, no FastPass.
[00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.580]   And the guy there that was manning the booth said,
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.260]   is it just the two of you?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.100]   And I said, yes, sir.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.500]   And he goes, go ahead.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.460]   [congregation laughing]
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.300]   And I said, what?
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.500]   He goes, go ahead.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.180]   [congregation laughing]
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.980]   And I said, is this a four hour line?
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.100]   He goes, go, go ahead.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.980]   And Finley's like, I told you.
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.780]   [congregation laughing]
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.460]   And I was just like, are you serious?
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.300]   Are you serious?
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.140]   So we go and I mean, it's amazing.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.300]   Waited four minutes for that ride.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.460]   It was incredible.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.540]   And it's, I mean, God, I was just like,
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.500]   God, how amazing are you?
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.380]   You care.
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:35.900]   He cares for you too.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.740]   He loves you.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.540]   He cares about silly things.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.580]   And I understand all the thoughts
[00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.780]   that invade your mind right now.
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.460]   If he cares about that, what about this?
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.300]   I get it, I get it.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.900]   You know, but he cares.
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.860]   That's what you need to know.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.980]   And that same little girl, two days later,
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.580]   comes into my bedroom at night,
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.860]   tears running down her face,
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.420]   saying, Daddy, I prayed that I wouldn't have bad dreams.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.380]   I prayed that I wouldn't have bad dreams.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.260]   And I keep having them.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.940]   Doesn't God care?
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.140]   Why doesn't he care?
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.660]   She made the same mistake that we made.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:23.460]   Same mistake that I'm tempted to make.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.860]   God, don't you care?
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.140]   You see me down here?
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.980]   This goes south, don't you care?
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:36.020]   Yes, he cares.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:42.220]   There are a lot of reasons he may not answer your prayer.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.300]   But it's not because he doesn't care.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.340]   He cares.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.820]   He came here in the form of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.300]   lived a perfect life, and died the death
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.100]   that you deserve for you to pay for your sins
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.300]   so that you could commune with him.
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.660]   And you say, well, why doesn't he answer my prayer?
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.340]   I don't know why.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.340]   I don't know.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.100]   But one day you will.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.020]   Okay, and can we just look backwards for just a moment?
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.260]   Like, let's just, for a moment, can I tell you something?
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.220]   Like, my desires in life have changed.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.620]   Has yours ever changed?
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.900]   Like, I can remember when my sister got married
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:31.900]   and I was 16 and my brother-in-law,
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.460]   my now new brother-in-law asked me, he's like,
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.620]   hey, what kind of car, if you could have any car
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.740]   for the rest of your life, what would you want?
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.300]   He said, if you could have any car
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.580]   for the rest of your life, what would you want?
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.780]   I said, oh, man, that's easy.
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:48.780]   I want an Isuzu Amigo on Daytons with hydraulics
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.540]   for the rest of my life.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.460]   You guys, you're like, what are Daytons?
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.300]   Those are Daytons.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.260]   With a candy paint, that was also what I said.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.100]   With candy paint.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.020]   I said, do I drive that for the rest of my life?
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.500]   Right, can't wait.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.820]   We got another one if you wanna see it, just a variety.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.340]   It's a thing.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.420]   It's a thing, yeah.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.660]   Somebody stop judging me, okay?
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.220]   Jeez, wow.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.220]   So many crazy faces.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.460]   That's what I wanted, right?
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.660]   Now, call me crazy, but that's not really
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.660]   my dream car anymore.
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.780]   You're like, why was it then?
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.780]   'Cause I was a straight up gangster, that's why.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.260]   And so, you know, our desires change.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.580]   Let me just go one more with you, okay?
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.260]   So I was actually in my hometown this past week,
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.300]   and while I'm there, I happened to run into my ex-girlfriend.
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:38.860]   Wasn't awkward at all, you know?
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:40.060]   I'm like, hey, how you doing?
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.900]   You look good.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.720]   I mean, you don't look good.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.420]   I mean, okay, whatever.
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.700]   What am I doing with my hands right now, you know?
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.000]   And I'm like, it's good to see you,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.580]   and so, and bye.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.540]   And so anyways.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.540]   And I just think, because here's the deal,
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.900]   'cause she broke up with me.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.460]   And it hurts.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.540]   It hurt real bad.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.900]   I can remember how bad it,
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   I can remember going to God,
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.300]   tears streaming down my face.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.420]   God, please change her heart.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.900]   Please bring her back.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.960]   Lord, would you supernaturally make her love me, okay?
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.880]   See, past all my faults, right?
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.600]   And I'll, you know, thank God,
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.440]   as they say for unanswered prayers.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.960]   That would have been a disaster.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.760]   I look at my kids today, my amazing wife today.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.040]   Like I wanted her more than I wanted anything in life
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.440]   at one moment, and I'm begging God, don't you care?
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.960]   And he's like, dude, I got, yes, I care.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.880]   I don't know if he says dude,
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.280]   but he says I care.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.600]   Right?
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.840]   He's like, yes, I care.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.520]   I mean, thank God for unanswered prayers.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.580]   No offense, Kelly.
[00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:01.160]   I changed her name, that's not her real name.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:08.020]   But I think you're gonna get up there,
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.520]   and I think God's gonna be like,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.880]   why didn't you ask me more?
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.160]   Why didn't you ask me more?
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.880]   Like, was I not clear you could ask me for anything?
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.560]   James four, verse two says,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.640]   you have not because you ask not.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.800]   He says, you do not have because you do not ask God.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.720]   You do not have because you do not ask God.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.560]   He's like, there's things that God wants to give you
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.600]   that he's waiting for you to ask for.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.200]   Like, that's amazing.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   And that if we asked, he'd give them to us.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.840]   That seems to be what that verse says.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.800]   I don't wanna have bad theology,
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.540]   but it seems clear there.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.960]   And so here's what I know,
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.200]   is I can ask God for whatever I want
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.240]   while I can seek what he wants.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.840]   And that as I stand at that door and I knock,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.000]   he's going to, and his Holy Spirit at work in my life,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.560]   he's going to change my desires to his desires.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.760]   Ultimately, I can keep asking and keep asking
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.840]   and keep asking, and he will work in my life
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.440]   to show me what he wants of me.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.560]   And that as I ask in that process, there's two results.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.120]   One, is he's going to give me what I'm asking for,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.600]   or two, he's going to ultimately change
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.440]   what I'm asking for to match what he desires for me.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.840]   And I'm not preaching prosperity gospel right now,
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.880]   which is wicked.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.760]   God is not a genie, you know, that you can command to do
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.440]   or obligate to do anything that you want.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.040]   He's a loving father that desires
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:39.140]   to give you what you need most.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.520]   He is a loving father that desires
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.840]   to give you what you need most.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.360]   And when you ask of him, you can trust him.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.480]   And so our attitude in prayer is dependence
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.440]   while our activity of prayer is intentional.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.660]   And the power is not in the one who asks,
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.720]   but the one who answers.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.340]   He has the power.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.840]   Verse 11, "Which of you fathers," Jesus says,
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.080]   now he's talking to them, he's like,
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.960]   "Hey, you guys are dads, you got children.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.220]   "Which of you, if your son asked for a fish,
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.720]   "would give him a snake instead?
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.720]   "Or if he asked for an egg, would give him a scorpion?
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.720]   "If you then, though you are evil,
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.840]   "know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.220]   "how much more will your Father in heaven
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.220]   "give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?"
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.280]   And so why we pray, third point, why we pray,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.560]   because we know who answers.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.440]   We pray because we know who answers.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.740]   The remnant knows the one who answers our prayers.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.400]   And so if you have a high view of God,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.120]   he's so holy and mighty and uninterruptible,
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.840]   you have a wrong view of God.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.000]   He is holy and omnipotent and all powerful,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.400]   and he loves you and he comes to you
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.880]   and he's moving towards you
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.640]   and he desires you to talk with him
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.280]   like you talk to anybody.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.760]   He wants a relationship with you.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:15.240]   Zephaniah 3, verse 17, "The Lord your God is with you.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.920]   "The mighty warrior who saves,
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.140]   "he will take great delight in you.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.160]   "In his love, he will no longer rebuke you,
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.300]   "but will rejoice over you with singing."
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.960]   And this is fulfilled in Christ, this prophecy.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.780]   It's fulfilled in Christ.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.680]   I love my kids, and I hate watching them struggle
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.440]   with something when I can help them and they don't ask me.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.920]   I'm like, sometimes I'm here, I'm like,
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.360]   why don't you ask me?
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:54.240]   God's not trying to give you snakes and scorpions.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.480]   One time when Weston, before he could talk
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.080]   when he was younger, we were eating at Matito's,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.960]   which is a Mexican restaurant here in Dallas.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.640]   I remember trying the hot sauce,
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.040]   we're kind of hot sauce people, salsa people,
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.880]   that's a big thing in our home.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.720]   And I told my wife, I'm like, hey, it's really hot today.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.960]   Like, wow.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.680]   They broke out the ghost pepper or something,
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.760]   like, this stuff is hot.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.720]   And I'm like, patting my forehead, like, whoa, it's hot.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.680]   And my son, he's right there in his high chair,
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.800]   and he's like, uh, uh, uh, 'cause he couldn't talk,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.940]   he's like, uh, uh, you know, give me some of that stuff
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.440]   that you're eating, the red stuff, the bright red stuff,
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.120]   give it to me.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.760]   And I move it back.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.000]   And you know what he's thinking, right?
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.440]   He's like, how wicked are you?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.240]   Like, I'm right here, I want that,
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.480]   and you're gonna move it away from me while you enjoy it?
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.480]   Like, what's your problem?
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.720]   And like, how wicked would I have had to been
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.960]   if I was just like, oh, you want this?
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.460]   Okay, we'll see how bad you want this.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:54.980]   Go ahead, buddy.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.660]   Right?
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.980]   We'll see.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.760]   But he's confused.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.700]   From his perspective, it just looks like
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.200]   I'm holding something back from him.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.700]   And right now, you're thinking, yeah,
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.000]   yeah, that's fine for your son,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.200]   but what about my mom with cancer?
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.240]   What about the breakup?
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.480]   What about that sickness?
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.900]   What about the loss of the loved one?
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.440]   What about that job, JP?
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.200]   That's different than your silly hot sauce story.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.640]   And I'm like, I don't know.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.360]   But can I tell you something from my son's perspective?
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.480]   It looks the same.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.160]   He just sees a dad who's supposed to love him
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.600]   holding something back from him while I enjoy it.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.340]   That's all he sees.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.760]   And he's confused, and I know you're confused.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:42.160]   And all I know to tell you, 100% certain of it,
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.200]   you can trust God.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.440]   I've had a mom with cancer.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.840]   I've lost loved ones.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.280]   I've had hardships.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:54.160]   And I choose to trust that the Father is good,
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.880]   and He desires to give me good.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   And trusting that has served me really, really well
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.300]   since I've been a Christ follower.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.200]   And I commend you to try it.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.480]   I commend you to do it.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.980]   So you might be like, why ask God if He knows any ways?
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.640]   Can I answer that?
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.360]   Because He wants you to.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.680]   He likes it.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.840]   He enjoys you asking Him.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.580]   Like, who doesn't love to give people things
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.960]   that they ask for?
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.000]   Like, when someone comes to you,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.200]   and they're like, I really, really want this,
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.320]   and you're like, oh, I could give you that.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.160]   There you go.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.000]   Like, that's God.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.820]   Like, He can do that.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.140]   He enjoys you asking Him.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.000]   The Scriptures make that really clear.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.680]   And so, the answer of our prayers is a loving Father
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.080]   who knows best what we need.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.640]   Let me just give you three applications real quick.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.660]   One is from a book I read called A Praying Life.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.500]   I commend it to you.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.760]   It's an incredible book.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.180]   It's called A Praying Life.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.060]   You're gonna email me later.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.020]   What was the name of that book?
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.740]   A Praying Life is the name of that book.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:08.860]   And in it, one of the things it recommends
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.220]   is not so much a prayer journal, but these prayer cards.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.960]   And this has really been effective for my life.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.880]   And so, as I struggle to pay attention during prayer,
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.860]   you just write out a card.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.060]   I have one for Monica, one for every child,
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.000]   one for the ministry, one for friends that I work with,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.660]   one for myself, for my career, for my ministry.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.660]   And it just has a verse on it
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.540]   that is a verse that I pray over each one of those people.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.420]   It changes depending on who the person is
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.740]   and what the situation is.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.260]   And it just has like one, two, or three
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.340]   prayer requests with it.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.140]   And so, here's the one for the porch, right?
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:42.780]   And the verse up top is Ephesians 3, verses 16 through 19.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.860]   I just prayed, Lord, would you strengthen them
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.260]   with your Holy Spirit?
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.780]   I pray that Christ would dwell in their hearts.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:52.340]   I pray that they would understand the love of Christ
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.180]   deep within them.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.620]   That all comes straight from that verse.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.580]   That you would be used by God.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.180]   And I pray that he would use you to change the world.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.820]   That young adults are listening,
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.420]   that you're not just consumers,
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.420]   that you don't just love it 'cause it's good worship,
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.300]   or it makes you feel good, chicken soup for the soul,
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.300]   shot in the arm, but that you'd leave here
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.700]   and you would put into practice.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.140]   Could you imagine what would happen to the world
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.740]   if everyone left here and prayed daily,
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:22.500]   regularly, in activity and attitude?
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.860]   You would literally change the world.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.900]   Jesus may come back the moment that happens.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.760]   Okay, what if we did that?
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.500]   The second thing, application I'd give you is this week,
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.620]   and you can do this right now, schedule a time to pray.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.080]   Maybe tomorrow, find some extended time
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.220]   for you to go to a place without your phone,
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.080]   without distractions, and just pray and fight to focus.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.180]   You stand at that door and you knock.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.140]   Fight to focus, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, two hours,
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.260]   whatever is the right number for you, what you have.
[00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.700]   Spend some time alone praying.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.860]   And the one thing that's helped me is I cut off my radio
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.180]   and I pray out loud, that really helps me focus,
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.020]   is just pray out loud in the car, audibly.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.900]   You can try that tomorrow, just when you get in the car,
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.380]   cut off your radio, cut it off tonight
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.980]   so that when you get in tomorrow, you remember,
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.460]   oh, it's off, so I'm gonna pray, all right?
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.800]   And so in summary, Jesus gives us the authority
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.140]   to approach the Father anytime.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.300]   And we approach Him in prayer with an attitude
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.420]   of dependence in the intentional activity.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.060]   And we know, thirdly, the one answering is our Father
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.100]   who loves us and knows what is best
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.500]   and has the power to bring it about.
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:40.740]   So I remember being in that cell, that guy came
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.300]   and he pulled open that door and he said,
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.500]   you gotta make a phone call, and I remember that dialogue
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.340]   like it was yesterday, I'm like,
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.400]   I don't wanna call my dad, this officer is ministering
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.280]   to me in the moment, he's like, hey, son,
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.720]   you need to call your father.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:56.680]   And I remember calling my dad, I remember sitting there
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.000]   on this end of the phone and it ringing
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.740]   and just being so nervous at what was about to happen.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.920]   And he answered the phone, sometimes my mom
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.600]   will answer the phone, but this time he answered the phone,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.440]   hello?
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.460]   I said, Dad?
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.560]   I'm in jail.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.840]   Well, we need to get you out.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:27.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.240]   Okay.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.360]   Yeah, how can I get you out?
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.840]   And I just remember thinking, man, I wish I'd have known
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.560]   that's how he was gonna respond.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.120]   He's like a loving father.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.040]   What, do I need to drive there?
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.740]   How much do I need to pay, do I need to sell something?
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.480]   What do I need to do?
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.060]   I'm gonna get you out.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.620]   The father did this for you through the gospel,
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.440]   his son Jesus Christ, you were stuck in your sin
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.260]   in a prison.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:05.240]   And if you're wondering if he loves you, he said,
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.040]   what do I need to do to get you out?
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.560]   To pry your life out of the grip of the enemy.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.000]   What must I pay?
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Should I give my Weston for you 'cause I'll do it?
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.280]   And he did it.
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:27.400]   He loves you that much, he's crazy about you.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.240]   I said, you know what we're gonna do?
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.240]   It's late, but we got a few more minutes.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.080]   We're gonna pray.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.040]   If you're at another campus, your worship leaders
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.620]   are gonna come up as I pray.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.560]   And I want you guys to spend just a few minutes
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   wherever you're at in prayer.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.760]   Here in Dallas, I want you to stay right where you're at
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.040]   and I want you to focus your mind on prayer.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.120]   You may write it out on your phone.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.680]   If you do, you might turn your phone
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.380]   on airplane mode first.
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.680]   For some of you, this is gonna be the most uncomfortable
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.360]   three minutes of your life 'cause you haven't talked
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.800]   to the father in a long time.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:10.840]   But I want you to fight to do that right now,
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:15.040]   to hold your attention, to not think about anything else
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.960]   but a conversation with the creator.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.560]   And if you don't have a relationship with the creator,
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.720]   start just like this.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.400]   I'm just gonna give you three things to hit on.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.480]   Start with God, I have sinned against you.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.040]   I have gone my own way.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.920]   But I know you sent your son Jesus Christ
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.480]   to die for my sins and you raised him from the dead.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.160]   Lord, would you give me your Holy Spirit
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.240]   and lead me the rest of my life?
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:51.440]   Confess your sins, acknowledge Christ's payment
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.320]   and ask for his Holy Spirit.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.940]   Father, we thank you that you are a good God to us.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:03.520]   You're an amazing God to us.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:09.180]   You're a father who loves us.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:14.420]   You're no longer counting our sins against us.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.420]   There's no condemnation for us.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.500]   You sent your son Jesus to pay for our sins.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.100]   I don't even know what that was like to watch him die
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:30.940]   for my sins, for my addictions and my foolishness.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.720]   God, you raised him from the dead.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.620]   Wow.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.380]   (congregation murmuring)
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.780]   Lord, would you help my friends
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.620]   to fix their hearts and minds on you
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.180]   and just to let their native language flow in their minds
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:53.200]   in a conversation with you?
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.820]   Would you help them hold their attention towards you, God?
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.020]   Would you do that now?
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.020]   (crickets chirping)
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:12.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
