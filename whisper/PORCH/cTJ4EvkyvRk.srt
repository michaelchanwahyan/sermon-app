00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:25,800
 Hey, Porch, how we doing tonight?

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 OK.

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,880
 Hey.

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,960
 If we haven't gotten a chance to meet, my name is Grace Ball.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,800
 And on behalf of our staff team, we

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,560
 are so thankful that you've decided to trust us

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,280
 with your Tuesday night.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,520
 I want to give a special shout out to our Porch Live locations.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,600
 So shout out to Porch Live Tulsa, Porch Live Boise,

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,640
 and Porch Live Springfield.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,240
 We are so thankful for you guys.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,560
 Yeah, let's give it up for them.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,360
 I love that.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,400
 Hey, we're excited for tonight because we

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,880
 get to hear from a special guest, a friend of the Porch.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,920
 And I have the joy of getting to introduce him.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,720
 He is an illusionist, a pastor, a Bible teacher,

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
 and so much more.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,280
 But what our team knows about him

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,760
 is he is someone who is faithful to know God's word, to teach it

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,240
 and to live it out.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,520
 And so Porch, I need your help tonight, OK?

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,160
 I need you to help me in welcoming

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,160
 our good friend of the Porch, Drew Worsham, to the stage.

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:33,600
 [APPLAUSE]

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
 Well, Porch, how are we feeling tonight?

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,240
 We're good?

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,320
 Ah, you sound amazing.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,040
 Well, like Grace said, my name is Drew.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
 Man, I live in San Antonio, Texas with my amazing wife,

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,280
 Jane.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,360
 And we've got two kiddos.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,120
 I have a five-year-old little girl named Matilda

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
 that we call Tilly.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,120
 And then I have a three-year-old son named Linden.

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,920
 And they might be tuning in, but I'm

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,080
 hoping they're asleep because it's bedtime.

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,680
 And it's a huge honor to get to be with you tonight.

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
 I love the Porch so much.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,840
 And I love this church.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,400
 And I love just Kylan's vision for the young adults of Dallas

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,280
 and just his heart.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,960
 And so proud of him and Brooke and welcoming their son, Cash,

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,680
 into the world last week.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,880
 And so it is a huge honor to get to just step into this space

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,960
 so that he can be home loving his family.

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,640
 Grateful for him.

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,040
 Love your pastor, TA, at Watermark, one of my closest

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,360
 friends in the world.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,480
 And I just-- listen, I think I said this last time.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,400
 Alex, I mean it.

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,440
 We have talked often about moving to this area

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,320
 just to be a part of the Porch and to be a part of Watermark.

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,240
 It's just the housing market, guys.

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,960
 It's crazy.

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,600
 So if any of you know someone who has a house for free,

58
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,760
 let me know.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,160
 We'll be into it.

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
 Well, if you have a Bible tonight,

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,680
 I'd love for you to grab it and meet me in Colossians chapter

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,360
 1.

63
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
 Colossians chapter 1.

64
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,680
 Now, I know that in the spring semester

65
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,320
 and going into the summer, you guys did a walk through

66
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,880
 Colossians, Watermark, you guys as a church are going through.

67
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,760
 But as you guys have been in this space of looking out,

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
 what it looks like to be a disciple of Jesus,

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,080
 and just kind of, if you will, the secret sauce of it all,

70
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,480
 I don't know if there's a more potent few verses than

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
 from the Apostle Paul in Colossians.

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,640
 So if you just give me the permission, I want to go back.

73
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,160
 And I want us to look at just a really impactful verse.

74
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,840
 And my hope and my prayer for you

75
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,600
 tonight is however you walked into this space,

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,400
 wherever you are in the spiritual journey

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,080
 that Jesus would invite you into deeper waters,

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,880
 and maybe, just maybe, that because of his word

79
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,760
 and him speaking to you that you may walk out of this room

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,000
 and forever changed.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,680
 And so as we look at Colossians chapter 1,

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
 I want you to see starting in verse 24,

83
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,920
 this is what Paul says.

84
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,240
 He says, "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you,

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,520
 and I'm completing in my flesh what

86
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,360
 is lacking in Christ's afflictions for his body.

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,000
 That is the church."

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
 Now, pause real quick.

89
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
 At first glance, you may read that verse

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 and think that what Paul is saying or trying to communicate

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,800
 is that what Jesus did was only half sufficient,

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,080
 that Jesus got the ball like two men in the 50-yard line,

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,640
 and now it's Paul's responsibility

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,800
 to get the rest of the way.

95
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,400
 And that is not what he's saying.

96
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,200
 What Paul is saying is that Jesus, his blood, and his death

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,040
 and resurrection, it's all sufficient.

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,680
 There's nothing that we could add to it.

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
 But what he's going to communicate

100
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,520
 is, though, even though Jesus died on a cross,

101
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,280
 went to a tomb, three days later walks out of the grave

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,480
 holding the receipts to sin and death,

103
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,240
 there were still people who had not yet heard this story,

104
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,680
 this life-changing story.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,920
 And so the fact that he's in prison,

106
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,000
 that he's been suffering these afflictions

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
 has actually been a catalyst for more people

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,840
 to get to hear this story.

109
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,680
 And so in verse 25, he says, "I have become its servant,

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
 "according to God's commission that was given to me for you

111
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,620
 "to make the word of God fully known,

112
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,460
 "the mystery hidden for ages and generations,

113
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,620
 "but now revealed to his saints.

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,140
 "God wanted to make known among the Gentiles

115
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,960
 "the glorious wealth of this mystery,

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,220
 "which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

117
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,020
 "We proclaim him warning and teaching everyone

118
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,420
 "with all wisdom so that we may present everyone

119
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,440
 "mature in Christ, a labor for this,

120
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,440
 "striving with his strength that works powerfully in me."

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,760
 Jesus, in these next few moments,

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,000
 I just pray that you would speak to us.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,200
 That there's not a person in this space or this room

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,520
 that needs to hear anything that I have to say.

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,480
 They don't need my thoughts or my opinions,

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,300
 Jesus, we need you.

127
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,520
 And so Father, I pray that you would speak

128
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,440
 to every single one of us in a way that we can understand,

129
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,200
 that you would whisper directly to our hearts

130
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,960
 and that you would invite us into something unique,

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,300
 something special, something intimate.

132
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,880
 So Jesus, remove all the noise.

133
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,760
 And tonight, may we encounter you,

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,660
 and because of that encounter, leave forever changed.

135
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,860
 We love you and we trust you.

136
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,720
 And it's in your name we pray, amen.

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,300
 Well, in March of 2014, I was dating Jane,

138
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,700
 and we lived in Washington State

139
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,060
 where we both served on staff at a church.

140
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,320
 And Jane had never gotten to see this side of my life,

141
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,360
 like never got to see the touring performer side.

142
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,460
 And we were doing an event, a conference in Nashville.

143
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,700
 And so I invited Jane to like fly out

144
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,700
 and meet me in Nashville for this two-day conference.

145
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,740
 And so she gets there,

146
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,780
 we had lots of friends that live in Nashville.

147
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,900
 And so we're both there.

148
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,780
 We finished the conference Sunday morning,

149
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,380
 we head to the airport early in the morning.

150
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,780
 And I don't know if you've ever been to BNA,

151
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,860
 which is the Nashville airport.

152
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,260
 When you walk in, there's a huge sign,

153
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,980
 much like many airports with all the locations

154
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,940
 to where they're flying in that day.

155
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,740
 And so I look at Jane and I was like,

156
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,620
 "Hey, if you had, just for fun,

157
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,120
 "if you had to pick any city in the world

158
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,360
 "that you see up there that you would like to fly to,

159
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,900
 "which one would you pick?"

160
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,220
 And she's like, "Ah, my favorite city is New York City."

161
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,840
 And I was like, "Surprise,

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,240
 "we're not going home to Washington,

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,220
 "we're actually going to New York City

164
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,900
 "where we're going to have lunch."

165
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,220
 And she immediately starts to kind of tear up a little bit,

166
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,740
 which as a guy, it's just immediately like,

167
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,380
 "Chi-ching, we're on the right page."

168
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,140
 So we walk through security, we get on the plane,

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,380
 we sit down, we take off.

170
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,500
 And the moment we take off, I reach into my bag

171
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,180
 and I pull out an envelope

172
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,980
 that just has the number one written on it.

173
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,420
 And I hand it to her.

174
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,580
 She opens it and inside of it, there was a postcard.

175
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,660
 And what she didn't know is that every city

176
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,860
 that I had visited and toured or performed at or spoke at

177
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
 over the course of our dating relationship,

178
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,220
 I bought a postcard.

179
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,340
 And on the back of it, I would write a prayer,

180
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
 just like almost like a love letter

181
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,940
 of what I was processing and feeling

182
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,340
 about our relationship at that point in time.

183
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,860
 And I had about 30 of these in my bag.

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,100
 So every 15 minutes, I'd pull one out, I'd give it to her,

185
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,940
 she would open it up, she would read it,

186
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,780
 and then we just kind of talk about it.

187
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,900
 We land in New York City and have a car

188
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,700
 that's waiting on us that picks us up

189
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,900
 and takes us into Manhattan where we grab a slice of pizza.

190
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,800
 Second thing is, I know that Jane's favorite food

191
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
 in the world is pizza,

192
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,140
 and no one quite does it like New York City.

193
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,540
 And so we grab a slice of pizza

194
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,940
 and then we head to Central Park,

195
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,420
 right outside of Central Park.

196
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,500
 I had rented a, not rented, I guess, yeah,

197
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,900
 reserved, that's the right word,

198
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,380
 a hotel room right outside Central Park.

199
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,580
 Now, here's what's crazy.

200
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,180
 This is just so in case you go in,

201
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,420
 I wasn't trying to be shady.

202
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,280
 Here's the deal.

203
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,060
 We walk into the lobby and I was like,

204
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,620
 "Hey, the room's yours.

205
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,940
 I want you to go shower, get ready,

206
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,800
 because ladies, here's the deal.

207
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,080
 You know that when you wake up super early for a flight,

208
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,280
 you're not always photo ready, you know?

209
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
 You're rocking like sweats and a side pony."

210
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,960
 So I was like, "Hey, you go get ready, do your thing."

211
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,640
 So I stayed in the lobby and she makes her way up.

212
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,440
 She goes into the room and in the room,

213
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 there's flowers waiting on her

214
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,280
 along with a lot of these postcards that I'd sent ahead.

215
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,640
 And so she's getting ready, reading these postcards.

216
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,880
 She comes down, got like all dressed up.

217
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,440
 And then we just walk through the city,

218
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,040
 grab coffee, whole time talking about our relationship.

219
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,000
 The whole time I'm just giving her these postcards.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,240
 We find our way to Central Park

221
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,620
 and we sit down on a park bench.

222
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,020
 And I reach into my bag and I was like,

223
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,380
 "Hey, this is the last one."

224
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,220
 And I hand it to her.

225
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,940
 She opens it up and it's a postcard from Central Park.

226
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,400
 The picture taken from where we were seated,

227
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,580
 the bridge and kind of the ponds and overlooking the city.

228
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,240
 She flips it around and it says,

229
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
 "This one's from all over the world."

230
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,560
 I hand her my phone.

231
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,640
 And what I had done is I'd had all of our friends

232
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,560
 and family from across the globe

233
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,980
 send in just a video of just speaking blessing

234
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,040
 over our relationship and just like

235
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,200
 how what they saw God do with us together.

236
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,000
 When the video was done, I put the phone into my pocket

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,680
 and I pulled out a ring and I went down on one knee.

238
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,800
 And for the very first time in our relationship,

239
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,480
 I told Jane that I loved her.

240
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 Those words meant something to me

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
 and I wasn't gonna say them

242
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,720
 till I could back them up with a promise.

243
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,880
 Ask her to spend the rest of her life with me.

244
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,440
 She obviously said yes

245
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
 or I wouldn't be telling that story.

246
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
 Thank you, thank you.

247
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,860
 (congregation applauding)

248
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,280
 (congregation cheering)

249
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,940
 True story, while we're in Central Park,

250
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,980
 when I go down on one knee,

251
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,640
 it immediately starts snowing in Central Park.

252
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,780
 Which at this point you're like,

253
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,980
 "Drew, I feel like I was tracking with you now,

254
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,780
 "I just feel like you're making all this up."

255
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,180
 (congregation laughing)

256
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,260
 The only reason I know that is some of our closest friends

257
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,500
 had flown to New York before us

258
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,060
 and were taking photos of the whole thing.

259
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,460
 And so I have a photo of it,

260
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,860
 it's like halfway snowing coming down

261
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,940
 while I'm on one knee.

262
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,300
 Now, why do I tell that story?

263
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,780
 One, it's an amazing story

264
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,660
 and I earned every bit of it, okay?

265
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,300
 And then two, fellas, just trying to raise the bar, okay?

266
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,340
 (congregation laughing)

267
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,140
 (congregation cheering)

268
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,400
 Ladies, you're welcome.

269
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,020
 Well, that moment, listen,

270
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,900
 we immediately began to kind of start

271
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,660
 to plan the wedding day.

272
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,900
 And then just a few months later,

273
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,500
 here in Dallas, Texas,

274
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,660
 I watched Jane walk down an aisle dressed in white,

275
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,100
 that she earned every bit of that.

276
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,460
 And we stood on an altar and we made promises

277
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,700
 that my life is no longer mine,

278
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,540
 like I will use every heartbeat to serve you,

279
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,700
 to support you and vice versa.

280
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,260
 And then we celebrated the night away

281
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,700
 with all of our closest friends and family.

282
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,900
 And at the very end of the night,

283
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,700
 like we ran through a hallway of sparklers

284
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,380
 that our friends were holding.

285
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,460
 And I wanna just pause and I want you to imagine

286
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,260
 that as we walked through those sparklers

287
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,340
 headed to the limousine,

288
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,140
 that once we got to the end of the sparklers,

289
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,060
 if I looked at Jane and I said,

290
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,580
 "You did amazing out there.

291
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,820
 "High five, good game, I'll see you next week."

292
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,940
 And I just walk away, get in my car

293
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,020
 and drive to my apartment.

294
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,100
 And she gets in her car and goes to her apartment.

295
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,980
 And then I just see her a couple of days later.

296
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,900
 Like immediately something in you is like,

297
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,460
 "Ugh, like no, like surely not, right?"

298
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,340
 Like that's not how I pictured my story going.

299
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,260
 Well, here's why, and I want you to not miss this.

300
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,660
 Because every single one of us in this space,

301
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,940
 and in this room, or tuning in live,

302
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,380
 like you know that no matter how amazing

303
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,980
 the engagement story is,

304
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,040
 no matter how beautiful the wedding is,

305
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,540
 neither of those are actually the point.

306
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,220
 The point is what you do after you say, "I do."

307
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,940
 And the life that you begin to build together

308
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,740
 and live out together.

309
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,540
 And my fear is that so many of us in this space

310
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,100
 that we have a tendency to do this exact same thing

311
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,660
 with Jesus.

312
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,940
 That we show up every Tuesday night

313
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,820
 and we have an amazing experience.

314
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,620
 And we sing the songs and we raise our hands

315
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,780
 at the appropriate time.

316
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,500
 And we sing the Christian karaoke and we take notes

317
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,700
 and we lean in and we walk out.

318
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,420
 We have this amazing feeling.

319
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,420
 And then it's like we walk out with Jesus

320
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,460
 and we're like, "You are amazing out there, Jesus.

321
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,000
 "Phenomenal, high five, I'll see you next Tuesday.

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,860
 "I'll see you next Sunday."

323
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,300
 Not realizing that this is beautiful.

324
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,980
 This is amazing.

325
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,820
 Just like the engagement or the wedding.

326
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,420
 But this is not the point.

327
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,640
 And if we make this the point,

328
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,700
 we may miss out on the beauty of the relationship

329
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,440
 that Jesus is inviting you and I into.

330
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,620
 And I love that at the porch,

331
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,940
 and that you guys have been walking through this series

332
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,180
 all about discipleship and really growing in the intimacy

333
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,320
 and relationship with Jesus.

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,300
 And so tonight, what I want to do

335
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,880
 is I want to share with you the one thing

336
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,880
 that has changed my entire journey and walk with Jesus.

337
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,400
 The thing that I wish desperately that I would have known

338
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,100
 when I was in your season and in your seat.

339
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,080
 And Paul here just walks us through it.

340
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,000
 And that he says this, just actually,

341
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,180
 I want you to see this again.

342
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,200
 Jump down to, we'll do verse 26.

343
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,680
 Paul is writing this letter to a people

344
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,480
 that honestly, if they were living today here in 2024,

345
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,180
 they would find themselves getting more of their theology

346
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,000
 from TikTok than Jesus.

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,640
 Glad none of us do that.

348
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,960
 For many of them, Jesus was just a supplement

349
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,800
 to their lives.

350
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
 So life is good, we just sprinkle a little Jesus

351
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,400
 and he makes it a little bit better.

352
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,140
 Almost like he was a genie.

353
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,240
 But they found themselves stagnant and confused

354
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,520
 in the spiritual journey,

355
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,220
 begging the question, is there more?

356
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,080
 So Paul in verse 26, he says this again.

357
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,000
 Oh, this is so good.

358
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
 I hope you don't miss it.

359
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,120
 He says the mystery, the mystery of all of this,

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,440
 this whole thing that's been hidden for ages

361
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,160
 and generations, but now revealed to his saints,

362
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,880
 that's you and I.

363
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,520
 Which listen, that just immediately,

364
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,720
 when we read that, that should beg the question,

365
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,120
 ooh, what's this mystery?

366
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,720
 Paul, please tell us more.

367
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,360
 And he says in verse 27,

368
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,080
 God wanted to make known among the Gentiles,

369
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,680
 which is the vast majority of us,

370
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,240
 especially if we're not Jewish,

371
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,020
 the glorious wealth of this mystery.

372
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,860
 Here it is.

373
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,980
 Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

374
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:52,860
 What Paul just said is that the secret to all of this,

375
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,940
 if you want to know what it really boils down to,

376
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,180
 the heartbeat of Jesus's message

377
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,780
 and throughout the rest of the New Testament,

378
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,940
 if you want to know what it all centers around,

379
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,940
 here it is, it's the fact that Christ is in you.

380
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,100
 That the God of the universe,

381
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,540
 the moment that you and I say yes to him,

382
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,620
 that for whatever reason,

383
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:18,380
 he chooses to take up residence inside of us.

384
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,860
 And what is so strange

385
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,920
 is that for many of us in the Western church,

386
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,260
 you hear me read that or say it or repeat it.

387
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,580
 And for many of us, our default setting is big deal.

388
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,480
 Like so many of us in this room

389
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,460
 could be underwhelmed by that fact.

390
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,060
 That you hear, you're like, yeah, Drew, big deal, we know.

391
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,620
 Listen, man, like this is not our first time

392
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,940
 at a church event.

393
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,860
 Like many of us, like we grew up in vacation Bible school.

394
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,540
 We know the songs, we even know the motions

395
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,180
 that Jesus deep, deep down in our heart, spell it.

396
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,700
 Like we know, bro.

397
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:12,340
 But porch, what I want you to hear tonight

398
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,460
 is that this is a really big deal.

399
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:22,860
 At the moment that you and I meet Jesus,

400
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,120
 at the moment that we surrender our lives to him,

401
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,780
 that the scripture says that the very God

402
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,580
 that spoke the world into existence

403
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,300
 for whatever reason now lives and dwells inside of you,

404
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:54,820
 that the very power that brought Jesus Christ

405
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,820
 out of the grave now courses through your veins.

406
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,260
 Let that just sink in.

407
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,100
 And just can we be real for a second?

408
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:15,700
 For so many of us, if I were to take the average person

409
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,420
 who claims to be following Jesus,

410
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 claims to be a disciple of Jesus,

411
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,700
 and I were to hold them next to a person

412
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,760
 who's not yet a follower of Jesus,

413
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,540
 and I were to have us dissect and go,

414
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,580
 what's the difference between these two people?

415
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,340
 What's the difference between you and a coworker

416
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,400
 that doesn't claim to know Jesus?

417
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,700
 What many of us would find out is that,

418
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,840
 well, I cuss a little bit less.

419
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,300
 I party a little less hard.

420
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,560
 I watch a few less rated R movies.

421
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,760
 I wait to date two to really like make out hard.

422
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,140
 Like, and then I have this like boring committee meeting

423
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,720
 thing that I have to do on Sunday mornings

424
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,580
 and occasionally Tuesday nights.

425
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,360
 But other than that, that's about it.

426
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,320
 Are you kidding me?

427
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 Is that all there is?

428
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,260
 That we're just a little bit more moral

429
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,700
 than the world around us?

430
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,580
 Or could it be true?

431
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,920
 That the mystery to this thing,

432
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,440
 the secret to this thing, the power in this thing,

433
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,080
 is that Christ actually lives and dwells inside of us

434
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,220
 and so few of us are actually tapping into that.

435
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,720
 So we just think for a second,

436
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,100
 to see the bigness of this.

437
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,160
 The entire Old Testament, if you wanna sum it up tonight,

438
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,620
 was marked by three different words.

439
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,480
 And three words were there, was this, God with us.

440
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,880
 You hear it repeated over and over again

441
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,720
 throughout the Old Testament.

442
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,280
 That God was with Adam and Eve

443
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
 in the cool of the day in the garden.

444
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,360
 That God was with Abraham.

445
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,940
 That God was with Moses.

446
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,680
 God was with the Israelites.

447
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,120
 Clyde by day, fire by night.

448
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,800
 God was with King David.

449
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,500
 God was with the prophets.

450
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,560
 That even, oh my gosh, we're getting closer to Christmas.

451
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,840
 That Jesus, God in the flesh,

452
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,200
 wraps himself in human flesh

453
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,960
 and when he shows up in Christmas time, we call him what?

454
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,680
 Anybody remember?

455
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 Emmanuel, anybody know what that translates as?

456
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,340
 God with us.

457
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,680
 Yeah, but then he ascends into heaven

458
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,500
 and in this moment, everything shifts.

459
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,580
 From this moment forward,

460
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,360
 like our identity is no longer marked simply

461
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,200
 by God with us.

462
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,200
 But for us, Christ is in you.

463
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,640
 He's in me.

464
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,480
 He's in us.

465
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,760
 Like this is really big deal.

466
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,560
 And for those of you who maybe you're more

467
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,760
 of a visual learner, I have something for you, okay?

468
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,600
 To be helpful.

469
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,700
 It's not a magic trick.

470
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,600
 Don't get ahead of me, okay?

471
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,300
 You'll be disappointed at the end.

472
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,000
 So here's what we're gonna do.

473
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,280
 Tonight, what I want you to do is I want you

474
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,240
 to let the water here in this bottle

475
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,880
 represent the manifest presence of God, okay?

476
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,160
 And in the garden of Eden,

477
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,200
 listen, at the very beginning of the book,

478
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,920
 God speaks the world into existence.

479
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,760
 Everything that we know and the things that we don't know,

480
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,800
 God uses his words like a paintbrush

481
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,880
 and he creates all things.

482
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,360
 On the sixth day, God reaches into the dirt.

483
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,440
 It would be the very first thing

484
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,640
 that God would ever touch in the scriptures.

485
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,200
 He breathes life into humanity.

486
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,040
 Why?

487
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,680
 So that we could have a deep, intimate relationship

488
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
 with the God of the universe.

489
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,720
 So that his presence, that we could experience it

490
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,320
 in its fullness in the garden,

491
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,440
 like no distractions, no sin, no pain.

492
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,440
 We make it three chapters into the book

493
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,040
 before we screw it all up.

494
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,280
 And we looked at God and said,

495
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,240
 hey, kind of thank you, but no thanks.

496
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,200
 I wanna do this my own way.

497
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
 And we gave God kind of the proverbial middle finger

498
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,240
 and said, I wanna do this on my own.

499
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,440
 And in that moment, listen,

500
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,680
 humanity committed treason against the high King

501
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,240
 and it fractured the world as we know it.

502
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,700
 And so listen, we all feel that.

503
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,880
 Like you don't scroll very long before you're like,

504
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,440
 yeah, it's pretty jacked up.

505
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,240
 Or you're better yet, like maybe this is just me.

506
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,720
 Maybe you can't relate, but I have a three-year-old son.

507
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,480
 He hangs out with other three-year-olds.

508
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,680
 I don't hang out with them very long

509
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,720
 before I back up and go,

510
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,000
 whoa, those are the most evil creatures

511
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,540
 on planet earth right there.

512
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,200
 But what's interesting is we don't have to pull my son

513
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,160
 aside and go, hey, buddy, when you don't get your way,

514
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,120
 bite him, punch him in the throat,

515
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,520
 grab what you want, yell mine and run.

516
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,800
 Like we don't have to rehearse that.

517
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,560
 Like it's his default setting.

518
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,360
 Okay, you're tracking with me.

519
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,280
 Now, but here's the deal.

520
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,320
 That even in that brokenness,

521
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,440
 that God chooses to not give up on humanity.

522
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,040
 And he wants to be with his people.

523
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,000
 He wants the intimacy restored.

524
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,280
 And so you see in the scripture, God's presence, it shifts.

525
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,120
 And the first place that you really see the manifestation

526
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,000
 is that of the mountain.

527
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,560
 Mount Sinai, if you wanna like think about Moses,

528
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,180
 or he has the burning bush moment

529
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,920
 where he goes up there to the 10 commandments.

530
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,520
 Or even if you think about the woman who's caught

531
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,780
 in the well, or not caught in the well, she is caught,

532
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,680
 sorry, I've just merged two stories.

533
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,280
 The woman who's at the well,

534
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,400
 not the woman caught in adultery,

535
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,080
 the woman caught in the well, I'll just say it again.

536
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,220
 The woman at the well, she quizzes Jesus and she says,

537
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,240
 okay, like some people say that we worship on this mountain.

538
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,320
 You say we're on this mountain, like which one is it?

539
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,900
 It's all this idea that the presence of God

540
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
 was found at the mountaintop.

541
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,280
 Now, when the Israelites are released from captivity,

542
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,040
 and they begin to wander through the desert,

543
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,580
 God's presence, yes, cloud by day, fire by night,

544
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,420
 but he instructs the Israelites to build a tabernacle.

545
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,560
 And when the tabernacle is built,

546
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,120
 God's presence would descend into this place.

547
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,400
 And this is where the people of God could go

548
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,800
 and meet with him.

549
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,240
 When they make their way into the promised land,

550
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,400
 God gives Solomon the instructions

551
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,720
 to build a permanent tabernacle called the temple.

552
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,820
 And it moves from the tabernacle to the temple.

553
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:16,960
 Then, when you move from Malachi into Matthew,

554
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,720
 the Old Testament to the New Testament,

555
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,040
 something crazy happens.

556
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,560
 Because the very presence of God

557
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,860
 chooses to leave its throne room

558
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,280
 and wrap itself in human flesh

559
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,760
 in the person of Jesus.

560
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,680
 That Jesus walks on our planet for 33 perfect years,

561
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
 teaching you and I what it means

562
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,000
 to be fully human and fully alive.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,840
 And then Jesus willingly lays his life down on a cross.

564
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
 And don't miss this, somehow I did.

565
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,120
 But that was not Jesus's cross.

566
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
 That was your cross.

567
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,240
 That was your death penalty

568
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
 for your treason against the king.

569
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,600
 And Jesus was willing to climb onto that cross

570
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,320
 and all, man, of the judgment

571
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,800
 due to the brokenness of the world,

572
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,240
 man, aimed at Jesus and he absorbed it like a sponge.

573
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,840
 And goes into the grave.

574
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,560
 And three days later, walks out of the grave

575
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,600
 holding the keys to both sin and death.

576
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,680
 Walks on earth for a couple of weeks

577
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,960
 with his closest friends

578
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,760
 and then he ascends back to heaven.

579
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,240
 Which begs the question,

580
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,520
 where is the manifest presence of God now?

581
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,160
 We don't have a temple.

582
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,040
 We don't have a tabernacle.

583
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,560
 We don't worship at the top of a mountain.

584
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,560
 So where is the presence of God now?

585
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,560
 It's here.

586
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:23,240
 It's in us.

587
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,480
 It's in us.

588
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,720
 This is why Paul would use language like we are the temple.

589
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,360
 That the presence of the living God

590
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,360
 chooses to live and dwell inside of you.

591
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,360
 That it courses through your veins.

592
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,040
 It's a really big deal.

593
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,040
 And I pray tonight that you begin to believe that

594
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,640
 and understand it and walk in it.

595
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,960
 So tonight,

596
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,520
 let me maybe put it this way.

597
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:14,480
 Whatever question that you walked into this room with,

598
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,520
 like whatever you were hoping for,

599
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
 and psychologists would say,

600
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,760
 there's really just a handful of questions,

601
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,600
 like seven questions that you probably are asking

602
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,920
 in every scenario that you step into.

603
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,200
 And here's the beauty of it.

604
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,720
 Christ answers all seven of those.

605
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,880
 And so tonight,

606
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,720
 if the question that drives you is the question,

607
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,960
 am I safe?

608
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,560
 Am I safe physically, emotionally?

609
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,400
 Maybe I have a temple.

610
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,440
 Maybe I have a tendency to let fear creep in,

611
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,760
 but the question of am I safe?

612
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,120
 Here's what I want you to see.

613
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,120
 That Christ in you means that you are never alone.

614
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,360
 That no matter the chaos around you,

615
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,200
 you're held securely by the one who's in complete control.

616
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,840
 And at the Lion of Judah, not only pads beside you,

617
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,360
 he dwells inside of you.

618
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,560
 Maybe your question is, am I secure?

619
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,480
 Maybe anxiety or worry are clouding your thoughts.

620
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,520
 Maybe it's fear of the future.

621
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,920
 Tonight, you can feel secure

622
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,000
 knowing that the God who owns a cattle on a thousand hills

623
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,040
 calls you son or daughter

624
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,440
 and that he is closer than your skin tonight.

625
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,440
 Or maybe, maybe you walk into this space

626
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,680
 and the question that you're constantly asking

627
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,400
 of every environment and every relationship is, am I loved?

628
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,800
 Am I truly loved?

629
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
 Am I worthy of love?

630
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,560
 Tonight, may you hear that God's love for you

631
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,520
 is not conditional.

632
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,960
 That Christ chose to live in you

633
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,960
 so you're loved deeply, fully, and unconditionally,

634
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,440
 even on your worst days.

635
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,680
 Maybe your question is, am I wanted?

636
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,280
 Then tonight you need to hear that you're,

637
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,560
 because of Christ in you, you are not tolerated.

638
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,200
 You are wanted.

639
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,600
 Christ in you is a constant reminder that you belong,

640
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,560
 that you are chosen before the foundations of the earth

641
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,480
 by God himself and that he wants to be near you

642
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,000
 in the most intimate way.

643
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,320
 Or maybe tonight your question is, am I successful?

644
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,560
 That you find yourself constantly trying to prove

645
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,360
 that you're enough in this, that you're successful.

646
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,640
 Then tonight you need to be reminded

647
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,200
 that you have nothing to prove.

648
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,800
 That God is already so proud of you

649
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,080
 because he finds you worthy enough to dwell inside of.

650
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,640
 Let that sink in.

651
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,920
 Who are you trying to prove what to?

652
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,080
 The God of the universe finds you worthy

653
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,480
 and says, that one's mine.

654
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,640
 I'll take residence inside of that one.

655
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,280
 Or maybe tonight you step into this space

656
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,600
 wondering, am I good enough?

657
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,720
 With Christ in you, you are complete.

658
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,320
 You don't have to prove your worth

659
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,960
 because he fills every gap and calls you worthy.

660
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,080
 You can stop performing for his approval

661
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,560
 and you can learn to just enjoy Christ in you.

662
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,880
 Or maybe your question is, do I have purpose?

663
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,080
 Christ in you gives your life meaning.

664
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,560
 He's guiding you to impact the lives of others

665
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,160
 and to live with purpose every single day.

666
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,600
 These truths remind you that with Christ in you,

667
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,560
 your worth, security and purpose are already established

668
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,640
 that you can live free.

669
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,600
 And Porch, this is huge and it changes everything.

670
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,520
 This isn't just, it's not like an app

671
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,040
 or it's not just something that you download.

672
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,320
 Like this is not an accessory or an update.

673
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,600
 No, this is a whole new operating system

674
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,960
 and it changes everything in us and around us.

675
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,680
 Here, can I just give you just a few tonight?

676
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,600
 Like think about it this way.

677
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,160
 So many of us, we think about prayer

678
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,720
 and prayer for those of us who recognize

679
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,480
 that Christ is in us, that he's in you.

680
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,440
 It moves from being us just talking to an imaginary friend

681
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,240
 and listing out all of our wants or needs or hopes

682
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,320
 that we say like it's some type of incantation

683
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,680
 and then like we just write to make God

684
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,720
 like do what we need or want.

685
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,200
 But it moves, prayer moves into a regular heartfelt practice

686
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:23,240
 that helps us cultivate deeper intimacy with Jesus

687
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,400
 by allowing us to share our deepest needs,

688
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,880
 to seek guidance and most importantly,

689
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,180
 just experience his presence.

690
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:42,680
 Your prayer life alone will shift and change

691
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,840
 if you really believe that Christ is in you

692
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
 or take scripture reading.

693
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,440
 Both of these things, prayer, scripture,

694
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,720
 many of us were like, oh, I know I should,

695
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,840
 I just don't want to.

696
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,880
 So scripture reading moves from being something

697
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,120
 that we check off our list, some spiritual to-do list

698
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,000
 or cramming for some spiritual pop quiz

699
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
 or making ourselves feel better

700
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
 because we're jumping through some religious hoop

701
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,240
 to engaging a 66 book love letter

702
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,200
 written to show us who we are, who he is

703
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,720
 and how we get to live life to the fullest.

704
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,560
 Dang, that'll get you up early in the morning

705
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,480
 or maybe it's obedience.

706
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,400
 When Christ is in you, obedience,

707
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,720
 it moves from somehow trying to earn God's approval

708
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,360
 to actually trusting Jesus and aligning our lives

709
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,100
 to his perfect will.

710
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,520
 Or maybe it's worship.

711
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,960
 I joked earlier, it moves from being

712
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
 this feel good Christian karaoke

713
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
 to actually deepening our connection

714
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,920
 and intimacy with Christ, helping us focus on his greatness

715
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,600
 and draw strength from his presence.

716
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,560
 Or maybe it's community.

717
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:11,080
 Community moves from an obligation

718
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,480
 or a solution to loneliness

719
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,080
 to stepping into relationship with others,

720
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,920
 brothers and sisters in the journey

721
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,800
 to offer and gain support, encouragement

722
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,720
 and reminders of who we really are when we get distracted

723
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,620
 and getting to experience Christ's power collectively.

724
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:42,200
 Or maybe, last one, it's how we view serving

725
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,200
 or even giving, that these things move from being a duty,

726
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,640
 something that we feel like we should do

727
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,280
 to an opportunity to let the love and power

728
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,200
 of Jesus Christ flow through your hands and feet

729
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,680
 in order to make places that we live, work and play

730
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,820
 look and feel more like heaven.

731
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:18,080
 This is a really big deal, church.

732
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,080
 And my hope and my prayer is that tonight

733
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:31,160
 that you feel the invitation to step towards Jesus.

734
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:41,000
 The number one question that I get

735
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,880
 when having this conversation is like,

736
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,040
 "Drew, this is cool."

737
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,520
 But like, "Okay, how do we tap into this?

738
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,920
 "How do we, what do we do?"

739
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,240
 And tonight I want you to hear, listen,

740
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,220
 if you know and love Jesus,

741
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,280
 like there's been this moment

742
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,040
 where you've pushed all the chips in,

743
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,840
 like Texas Holdemstall, your life is his.

744
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 Then there's nothing you do.

745
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,500
 Christ is already in you.

746
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,320
 For example, 10 years ago, a little over 10 years ago,

747
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,480
 I stood on that altar with my wife and made huge promises.

748
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,540
 I am no more married today than I was 10 years ago.

749
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:41,320
 But I am more deeply in love with Jane

750
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,600
 than I was 10 years ago.

751
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,760
 I'm closer to her.

752
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,200
 She's legitimately become my best friend.

753
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,000
 I really feel like in many situations

754
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,040
 that I can tell exactly what she's thinking

755
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,580
 before she even says what's on her mind.

756
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,140
 How does that happen?

757
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,000
 Hear me, church, please.

758
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,800
 Not because of performance or pretending.

759
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,800
 It has everything to do with proximity and time.

760
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,640
 That's it.

761
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,000
 That's it.

762
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,960
 That's it.

763
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,520
 And so tonight,

764
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,400
 may you feel the invitation of Jesus

765
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,040
 to just be with him.

766
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,560
 And in his presence, you will become more and more aware

767
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,720
 of his presence in you.

768
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,840
 And that's what changes everything.

769
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,760
 So Jesus, tonight,

770
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,640
 Father, I pray that you have spoken clearly to your people.

771
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,280
 I pray that every single person in this room

772
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,360
 feels zero condemnation, but instead, Father,

773
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,840
 they feel your loving kindness,

774
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,740
 drawing them closer and closer to you.

775
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,760
 And Jesus, whatever you have spoken over your people,

776
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,360
 I pray that they would have the courage

777
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,320
 and the boldness to say yes.

778
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,900
 Believing that you really are trustworthy,

779
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,080
 that you really are good.

780
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:47,320
 And Jesus, may we live in this life-changing truth

781
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,260
 of Christ in us.

782
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,680
 We love you.

783
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,160
 And we are learning to trust you.

784
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,760
 That's the new way of praying.

785
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,340
 (gentle music)
