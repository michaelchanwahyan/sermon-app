[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.840]   >> Well, hey Dallas, it's great to be with you tonight.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.640]   My name is Garrett.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.040]   If we've never met before, I wanna give a shout out to my Fort Worth family,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.520]   where I spend most of my Tuesday night missing you guys this evening.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.220]   Also to anybody that's dialed in through the porch app online or
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.240]   gathered in your city to experience the porch this evening.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.920]   So glad that you guys are with us.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920]   Hey, I wanna catch you up on some news if you missed it.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.960]   48 hours ago in the country of Pakistan,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.760]   on Sunday, an oil tanker disaster happened.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.000]   So this is an 18-wheeler oil tanker carrying about 5,000 gallons or so of oil.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.400]   And it turns over and starts gushing into the street.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.200]   And here's the thing about oil, it's valuable anywhere.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.440]   It's valuable in Texas, it's valuable in Pakistan.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.000]   It's worth money, it's liquid money, it's pouring out everywhere.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.280]   And all of a sudden, as soon as this disaster starts to happen,
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.720]   the word gets out that liquid money, aka oil, black gold as they call it,
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.240]   is leaking out everywhere all over the street by the thousands of gallons worth.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.600]   And one of the local mosques there in Pakistan starts to broadcast
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.760]   over their speaker that they normally use for a call to prayer,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.600]   starts to broadcast that oil is in the street.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.880]   And so everybody starts to grab buckets, they grab cans, they grab cups,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.000]   everything that they can possibly grab for the goal of grabbing some of that oil.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600]   Because that could be a life-changing event, right?
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.360]   So everybody rushes forward to enrich themselves on what has just happened.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.800]   And unfortunately, if you haven't read, it ignited and blew up.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.680]   And over 150 people, over 150 people and counting,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.680]   have lost their lives in the literal pursuit of wealth.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.400]   The actual action of wealth.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.880]   And the world says, "Get rich or die trying."
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.640]   Get rich or die trying, go get what you can.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.760]   Get rich or die trying.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.280]   And these people tried to get rich and they literally died.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.120]   So on that note, we're gonna begin the porch.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.360]   Welcome, so glad you're here.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.400]   So kind of a somber start.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.440]   The apostle Paul, the apostle Paul in 1 Timothy chapter six
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.800]   is going to beg you, beg you tonight, warn you.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.920]   He's gonna pull out all the stops.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.320]   You're gonna hear him say crazy, crazy warnings.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.100]   He's gonna pull out all the stops to convince you
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.220]   that get rich or die trying might be the most dangerous advice
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.520]   that you have heard yet.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.040]   And so 1 Timothy six is where we're gonna start.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.300]   And here is the challenge.
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.720]   If you can hear my voice right now,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.560]   you probably are in the wealthiest country
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.960]   in the history of the world.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.880]   If you're in the same room with me right now,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.440]   then you're in one of the most materialistic cities,
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.260]   for sure by reputation in that country,
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.200]   in the history of the world.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.120]   That's where we're at.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   And we are so accustomed to everybody just having a bucket
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.400]   and filling up everything that they possibly can
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.860]   as frantically as they can, that we don't even notice.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.320]   We don't even see where we are.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.460]   We don't even see what's going on
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.800]   because we're immune to it.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.960]   But this is what we do.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.980]   We pursue wealth.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.280]   It's natural for all of us.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.440]   It's the American dream.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.280]   It's what we do.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.320]   And I wanna tell you, I'm a struggler tonight.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.560]   I don't, this is not an area
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.280]   that I claim to have conquered.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.420]   I wanna read and interact with the text with you tonight,
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.760]   but this is not a place
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.400]   that I would call a strong suit for me.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.880]   I would much rather hustle and get on a grind
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.680]   and earn a dollar than I would to chill
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.940]   and be content with what I have.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.960]   And so this text is particularly challenging for me.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.800]   I want you to know that,
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.000]   but I think it's appropriate for us all to admit
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.500]   as we get started tonight,
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.360]   that pursuing wealth is more natural to us than we think.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.480]   This is why, this is why some of you
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.360]   have not been at a job longer than 12 to 18 months,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.520]   because as soon as somebody offers
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.880]   like 3,000 more dollars a year,
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.000]   you're like, boom, gone.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.200]   Like, I don't need to hear anything else.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.560]   Don't need to read a job description.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.880]   Give me the cash and I'm good, right?
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.240]   Some of you like make dating decisions based on this.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.320]   You know, it's like, okay, well,
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.800]   we don't have that much fun together.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.400]   And he, I think he kind of knows Jesus.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.320]   He's at least heard of Jesus,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.940]   but he's in medical school, winner.
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.160]   All right, big deal.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   All right, and so you're like completely
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.680]   wrapping your life around the pursuit of wealth
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.900]   and you don't even realize it.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.440]   And some of us, when we daydream,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.560]   oh man, this is me.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.880]   When we daydream, sometimes the daydream
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.540]   starts to look less about who you're with.
[00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.880]   You know, oh, when I'm 50, when I'm 60, when I'm 70,
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.920]   I wanna be with my family.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.440]   I wanna be with my brothers and sisters,
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.360]   my wife, my husband, my grandkids.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.280]   It stops looking like that and it starts to sound like
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.360]   this is where I'm gonna live, you know?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.880]   This is what I'm gonna have.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.580]   This is what I'm gonna live in.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.080]   This is the right address I'm going to have.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.040]   This is the kind of car I'm gonna drive.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.920]   And all of a sudden, your dreams and hopes and plans,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.320]   and as you picture life later
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.040]   when you're living it down the road,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.140]   all of a sudden it becomes more about what you have
[00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.980]   than who you're with.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.800]   We think materially instead of relationally.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.720]   It's just natural to us.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.540]   That's what we do.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.760]   Some of you can't complete a purchase
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.320]   without already thinking about the next one.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.200]   This is me.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.760]   Oh man, we bought a house.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   I got married 10 months ago.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.480]   We bought a house and as we did,
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.420]   four months later we remodeled the shower.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.200]   The house was built in 2014.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.520]   We don't need to remodel a shower.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.600]   That's ridiculous.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.040]   Now we barely closed the papers
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.860]   and I'm looking for ways to improve this thing.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.880]   It's embarrassing.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   All right, that was my authentic moment for the evening.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   And so we are, we naturally are moving toward wealth
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   and we don't even realize it.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.360]   We are embarrassingly rich.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   And I don't think God wants us to feel guilty about that.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.520]   But I do think he wants us to be careful about that.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   And get rich or die trying is a bad advice
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.900]   that may make for a great 50 cent debut album,
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.120]   but it is not gonna help you very much
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.040]   in your walk with Christ, all right?
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.880]   So we're gonna get started.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.240]   First Timothy six, all right?
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.520]   Verse three.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.780]   If anyone teaches a different doctrine,
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.260]   it's not gonna sound at first like he's teaching on money,
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.100]   hang with it.
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.660]   If anyone teaches a different doctrine
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.020]   and does not agree with the sound words of Jesus
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.940]   and the teaching that accords or fits with godliness,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.900]   then he's puffed up with conceit and he understands nothing.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.520]   In other words, if you disagree with Jesus,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.860]   then you have a conceit problem.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.680]   And part of the problem for these particular people
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.100]   that Paul has in mind is that they imagine
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.200]   that godliness is a means of gain,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.400]   that their Christianity is going to make them rich,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   that if they can be godly or faithful,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.860]   that somehow their bottom line is gonna actually
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.800]   and materially move in kind of a one-to-one relationship,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.180]   in kind of a push-pull relationship.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.120]   If I'm godly, then I will be wealthy.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.000]   And if you ever hear that message,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.240]   then you need to turn the TV off
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.840]   because that is not what God's word teaches.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.060]   It says right here that imagining that godliness
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.920]   is a means of gain is a mistake.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.860]   But in verse six, it says,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.120]   "Godliness with contentment is great gain."
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.440]   Godliness with contentment makes you already rich.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.280]   If you're godly today and you're content today,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.500]   then you are rich today.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.020]   Now that's a huge claim.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.860]   That's a big claim.
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.460]   I don't know about you, but that kind of makes my mind go,
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.980]   "Ah, are you sure?"
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.820]   'Cause last time I checked,
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.580]   my mood doesn't really change my bills.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.420]   And so if I feel content or if I feel happy
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.440]   or if I feel peaceful or if I'm godly or not,
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.900]   I still got the bills, I still got income,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.900]   I still got to do the whole financial thing.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.860]   And so how and why would he get away with a crazy claim
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.300]   like godliness with contentment is great gain?
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.860]   And here's why, it's pretty obvious.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.540]   Verse seven, "For we brought nothing into the world."
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.960]   For is like a because word right there.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.900]   "Because we brought nothing into the world."
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.860]   That's why godliness with contentment is great gain,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.540]   because we brought nothing into the world
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.960]   and you can't take anything with you out of this world.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.520]   Death is the end of the road.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.240]   And so the first reason,
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.840]   Paul's gonna give us two warnings tonight,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.120]   two warnings and an instruction,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.960]   two reasons why get rich or die,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.720]   trying is bad advice and then some instruction.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.040]   And the first warning is this,
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.260]   you are guaranteed to lose your money.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.480]   The death statistics are impressive, 100%.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.440]   There will be a day when you have nothing.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.800]   Billy Graham said, "I have never seen a hearse
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.740]   "pulling a U-Haul."
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.560]   You are not ever, you are not ever going to be able
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.120]   to get anything out of this world, okay?
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.320]   You are guaranteed to lose your money.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.600]   That's true just by experience.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.480]   It also says in the scripture in Hebrews chapter nine,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.520]   "It's appointed for man to die once."
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.360]   So it's appointed for you to die, that's going to happen
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.840]   and you're gonna lose everything you have.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.660]   Death is the great equalizer.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.280]   You might be a rare kind of rich.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.720]   You may be a rare kind of rich, right?
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.280]   The kind of person that people just wanna be around
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.040]   because it might go better for them.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.540]   But on the day of your funeral, your net worth will be zero.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.240]   Not a single thing will you have.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.280]   This is a really practical reason why get rich or die trying
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.340]   is really bad advice.
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.960]   Because the best you can actually do
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.420]   is get rich and then die.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.200]   That's the best you can do.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.240]   Nobody can outrun that.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.080]   You can't outlive that.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.600]   No amount of money can overcome that law.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.460]   You can get rich and then die.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.560]   That's all you can do.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.840]   You might've heard of John D. Rockefeller before.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.580]   John D. Rockefeller was considered to be maybe
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.880]   the most wealthy American in the history of our country.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.960]   He was an oil and philanthropist magnet essentially.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.500]   And his worth, at his peak in today's dollars
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.080]   would have been over 350 billion.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.400]   300, three, five, zero, nine zeros.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.120]   That's how much wealth this man had
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.440]   at the peak of his wealth.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.720]   You might've heard the story before they asked him,
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.260]   "Hey John, how much is enough money?"
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.200]   And he said, "One more dollar."
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.220]   You might've heard that.
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.220]   But you might not have heard this.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.160]   At his funeral, someone kind of edged up
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.360]   to John Rockefeller's accountant.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.200]   And he said, "Hey, how much did he leave?"
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.900]   The accountant said, "All of it."
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.120]   What do you mean how much did he leave?
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.960]   100% of it.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.920]   There's nothing about John Rockefeller
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.680]   that is going with him into the next life.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.640]   Now he left a mansion for his family.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.680]   He left Rockefeller Center in New York City.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.720]   Some of you have been there.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.520]   And so he left things behind in this world
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.880]   because of his wealth.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.320]   But he did not take anything with him out of this world.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.280]   Ecclesiastes 2.21.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.680]   This is not gonna be the most encouraging verse
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.760]   you've ever heard, I'm gonna warn you.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.100]   "For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.560]   "And then they must leave all they own to another
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.300]   "who has not even toiled for it.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.220]   "This too is meaningless and a great misfortune."
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.360]   Let me translate that.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.400]   You can get on your grind for 60 years
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.460]   and they're gonna throw you a 30 minute retirement party.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.520]   Everybody's gonna clap for you.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.720]   And then you're gonna die and your spoiled nephew
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.540]   is gonna get your money
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.080]   and they didn't do anything to deserve it
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.640]   except to be born into your family.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.380]   This is a great misfortune, says Ecclesiastes 2.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.540]   Whoever dies with the most toys still dies.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.100]   That's what it says in 1 Timothy 6, 7, paraphrase.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.060]   If you think, yeah, well, if I'm gonna die,
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.680]   I mean, I know the way our minds can get around
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.520]   this kind of thing.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.220]   You think, well, if I'm gonna die,
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.240]   sometime I still got a life to live between now and then.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.840]   So if I'm gonna die and it's gonna go to zero,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.960]   I guess I might as well have a lot
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.440]   between now and the time I die.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.200]   Paul knows that some of you think that way.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.220]   And that's why he is gonna turn up the heat a little bit
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.060]   on the next warning.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.320]   Look at this in verse eight.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.120]   "But if we have food and clothing,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   "with these we will be content."
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.160]   Try living that one out.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.120]   "But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.800]   And now listen to the vocabulary he reaches for
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.100]   when he starts to warn about the danger
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.500]   of wanting to be rich.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.620]   "But those who desire to be rich fall into a temptation,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.060]   "into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.840]   "that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.840]   "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils."
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.740]   That's a pretty popular misquoted verse right there.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.240]   You ever heard money's the root of all evil?
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.080]   You ever heard that?
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.900]   Money's the root of all evil.
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.240]   Bible says that money's the root of all evil.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.840]   The Bible doesn't teach that.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.520]   It doesn't say that money is the root of all evil,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.440]   as if you just see some evil out there.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.400]   And if you follow the path back to where it began,
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.520]   money's behind it all.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.560]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.680]   It doesn't say every evil in the world out there
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.800]   is because of money.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.480]   What it does say is that if you fall in love with money,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   you will become capable of any kind of evil.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.760]   If you fall in love with money,
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.120]   you will surprise yourself with what you're capable of.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.000]   "The love of money is a root of all kinds of evils."
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.160]   Anything can come from this thing.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   It's through this craving that some have wandered away.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.420]   From the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.480]   Pierced themselves with many pangs.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.920]   Money is a gateway drug.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.400]   If you fall in love with money,
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.320]   who knows what you'll love next?
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.480]   You might start to love respect.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.600]   You might start to love power.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.200]   You might start to love position.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.240]   Maybe one day you'll love money enough to steal some of it.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.080]   Maybe next you'll love it enough to cheat on your taxes.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.760]   Maybe one day, according to this,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.880]   you'll even wander away from your faith.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.960]   And you think that's crazy.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.080]   There's no way that I would do that.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.560]   But that's just the point.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.440]   Is if you fall in love with money,
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.680]   you don't know how crazy you're gonna become.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.000]   That is the danger of falling in love with money.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.640]   So my second point is this.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.560]   Loving money is self-destructive.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.360]   Loving money is self-destructive.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.000]   Suicidal to your faith.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.720]   If you fall in love with money,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.600]   you are destroying your faith.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.820]   They work together.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.940]   You can have money.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.280]   God, I mean, it says right there,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.120]   we have food.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.020]   We have food and clothing.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.860]   We'll be content.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.840]   So you're gonna need some amount of money
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.380]   to have food and clothing.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.220]   God knows that.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.800]   God's not calling you to hate your money
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.420]   or to pretend that you can operate in the world
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.880]   without some measure of money.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.400]   He is telling you that you cannot love money and love God.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.600]   Jesus said, related to this topic,
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.160]   you cannot serve both God and money.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.840]   No one can serve two masters.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.220]   And if you think you can, he's not your master.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.480]   You can't serve God and money.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.080]   And if you fall in love with money,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.360]   then your faith just jumped into the rear view mirror
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.800]   of your life and you were headed a different direction.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.160]   Another story came out this week of a jeweler.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.400]   This one is crazy.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.120]   Of a jeweler who claimed to have hidden some jewels
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.640]   and gold in New Mexico, in the mountains, okay?
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.240]   Now, my first reaction when I hear that is not,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.160]   hmm, I wonder how many mountains are in New Mexico
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.840]   and I wonder if I could somehow search them all
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.900]   and find the jewelry, okay?
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.640]   Or whatever the treasure is out there.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.800]   But are you ready for this?
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   Two people in the last five months have died in New Mexico,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.760]   in the mountains, looking for jewelry
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.040]   because a man claimed that he hid it there
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.880]   for alleged jewelry.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.400]   Now, I don't know what's crazier.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.280]   The fact that those people went after some kooks jewelry
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.440]   in the mountains of New Mexico,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.640]   or if part of you are on your phone on Google right now
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.160]   looking up flights to New Mexico,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.040]   trying to figure out, you know,
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.120]   like, oh, my aunt lives out there.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.960]   You know, we could stay with her.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.660]   This is gonna go great, you know?
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.500]   This will drag you into a pit.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.100]   This will drag you away from God.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.020]   There is no way that you can cultivate
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.220]   the kind of love relationship with God that you want
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.780]   and love money at the same time.
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780]   It's not possible.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.980]   Paul's telling you, you will self-destruct.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.660]   Galatians 6 says, "God is not mocked.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.400]   "You will reap what you sow.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.700]   "And if you sow to your flesh, you'll reap destruction."
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.040]   I can trace this in my life.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.260]   I've been alive 28 years.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.100]   It's not a long time,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.320]   but I've loved a lot of things that aren't God.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.760]   I can remember times I needed, I felt like I needed,
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.680]   I wanted new Nikes.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.040]   I can remember wanting a new fishing pole.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.480]   I can remember wanting my dad to take me out to play ball
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.360]   or go to the Rangers game.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.040]   I can remember wanting a new house.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.880]   And I can tell you this,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.080]   not a single thing has satisfied my soul except Jesus Christ.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.560]   And I know this, that when I love anything other than Him,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.280]   when I pursue anything other than Him,
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.760]   there is an interruption.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.580]   It is not a both and when it comes to our loves.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.700]   Now here's something important to see.
[00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.260]   I don't want you to miss this.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.160]   Nowhere in that text does the Bible demonize money, okay?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.960]   Nowhere in the text does it talk about dollar amounts.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.180]   It doesn't say you have to have a minimum amount of money
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:08.220]   to be a Christian.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.860]   It doesn't say you have to stay under a maximum amount
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.460]   of money to be a Christian.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.620]   It doesn't say that.
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.000]   There are no dollar signs.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.480]   It is talking directly to your heart's posture.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.320]   Do you see that?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.660]   Look at these words right quick.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.700]   In verse nine and verse 10, it says,
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.820]   "Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.780]   It doesn't say those who are rich
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.940]   are automatically in a temptation.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:28.780]   It doesn't say that.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.620]   Whether you have money or whether you don't
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.460]   is not the issue.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.600]   It's what do you love.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.420]   Those who desire to be rich.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.660]   Look in verse 10, "The love of money."
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.060]   I'm not saying money's the root of all evil.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.700]   It says, "The love of money, the human response to money
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.420]   is a root of all kinds of evils."
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.640]   Through this craving, there's another heart word.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.840]   It's through this craving.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.480]   Not through the having of money,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.240]   but through the craving of money.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.980]   And if your heart, if your heart gets wrapped
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.960]   around this thing, that is what will lead you away.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.320]   God is not calling you to hate your money.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.620]   He is the one who gives it to you.
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.840]   Later, the text will say to enjoy.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.760]   Focus your hope on God who gives you everything to enjoy.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.480]   And so he doesn't want you to hate it
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.640]   and he doesn't want you to love it.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.480]   He wants you to use it.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.080]   So the guy who stands up and says that God wants Christians
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   to be financially poor is just as wrong
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.000]   as the guy who stands up and says,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.820]   "God wants all Christians to be financially rich."
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.100]   There's nothing in the text that mandates a dollar amount.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:22.400]   You just need to see that.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.280]   The problem is not that you have any amount of it.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.420]   The problem is if any amount of it has you.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.860]   That's the issue in the text.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.380]   Hop down to verse 17.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.300]   It says, "As for the rich in this present age,"
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.860]   and I'm just gonna pause right there for a second.
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.480]   This is a unique opportunity.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.900]   The Bible is about to coach rich people.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.740]   So this is an interesting opportunity
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.580]   that you're about to see.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.420]   This is unique, okay?
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.040]   I don't know off the top of my head
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   anywhere else in the scripture
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.660]   that God actually takes the time to say,
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.660]   "Hey, and if you're rich, do this."
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.680]   David down here is probably like,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.880]   I got like three references for you
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.120]   that you've totally forgot about.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.380]   But I can't think of any other
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.960]   off the top of my head right now
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.440]   that involve God actually coaching rich people.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.360]   Okay, so here it comes.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.400]   "As for the rich in this present age,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.740]   "charge them not to be haughty."
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.880]   Don't be prideful.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.120]   Don't set your hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.880]   What an irony, since we think that riches
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.400]   is what is gonna secure us.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.600]   We think that money is what's gonna make our boat
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.560]   go straight and everything go smoothly, right?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.320]   And it is too volatile for that.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.680]   But on God, don't focus on the uncertainty of riches,
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.440]   but on God, who richly provides everything to enjoy.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.280]   There's a relief.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.300]   God's not calling you to sell everything you have
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.400]   automatically just because you come to the faith.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.200]   And you go, wait, didn't Jesus tell a guy,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.920]   "Sell all you have, give it to the poor,
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.920]   "and then follow me."
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.200]   Yes, he did, because he knew
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.640]   that's what that person's heart needed.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.540]   And if you're afraid of that, man,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.240]   maybe that's what you need.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.720]   But I know this, God does not mandate
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.120]   a uniform dollar amount that everybody's gotta come under.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.700]   What he mandates is that you love him and not your money,
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.800]   and he will take care of the rest.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.280]   Every dollar you have is a gift from God,
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.520]   and he's in charge of it.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.460]   Verse 18, "They," meaning the rich in this present age,
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.580]   "They are to do good, to be rich in good works,
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.460]   "to be generous."
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.300]   Be ready to share.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.200]   Don't be ready to collect.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.320]   Don't be ready to get things.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.480]   Be ready to share something.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.240]   "Storing up treasure for yourself,"
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.920]   storing up treasure for themselves,
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.880]   "as a good foundation for the future,
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.680]   "so that you may take hold of that which is truly life."
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.980]   You have an eternity ahead of you.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.600]   You're gonna spend forever somewhere.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.720]   That's for sure.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.140]   You're gonna spend forever in a place, awake.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.420]   That's where you're gonna be.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.320]   And how full your life is there
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.660]   depends on how empty you can make it here.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.720]   Paul's instruction tonight is be rich in good works.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.940]   It's the third point, straight from the text in verse 18.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.940]   Be rich in good works.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.980]   Now this is hard for us,
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.740]   because we are all rich on a global scale, all of us.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.980]   Now I know you don't feel rich.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.060]   I know you probably don't wanna think of yourself as rich,
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.540]   because that could come with some sort of a responsibility.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.060]   But I want you to know, on a global scale,
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.660]   you are probably, if you can hear my voice right now,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.700]   you are probably rich.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.880]   And so let me give you two resources,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.620]   just so you know I didn't pull that out of thin air.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.100]   One would be the Bible.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.300]   So that was just a couple of verses up,
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.100]   where it says, "With food and clothing, we'll be content."
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.540]   And so if you have food and you have clothing,
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.300]   and then anything on top of that, you have extra.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.820]   So if you have more than enough food,
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.620]   and you have more than enough clothing, congrats.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.700]   You are rich, man.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.900]   You are rich.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.100]   In 1 Timothy 6 terms, if you have more food,
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.060]   if you have more than food and clothing you need for today,
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.200]   then you are officially rich.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.600]   But if you wanna look at something
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.940]   that is objective in the sense
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.980]   that it looks at the whole world statistically,
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.180]   then I would invite you to go to globalrichlist.com.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.700]   Globalrichlist.com.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.060]   And you can find out, you just type in, it's super easy.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.900]   You type in your name,
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.260]   and you type in what your income is,
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.580]   and you hit start, and get ready to be embarrassed,
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.340]   all right, by how much wealth you have,
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.420]   and how difficult it is for the rest of the world, okay?
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.940]   So I'm just gonna assume safely tonight that we are rich.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.360]   And it's saying be rich in good works.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.460]   And I think we may be the worst rich people ever.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.220]   Like imagine what a good rich person would like.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.200]   Can you get that person in your mind?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.760]   Like what would a good rich person be like?
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.140]   I'm assuming that they would be fulfilled.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.420]   I'm assuming that they would be relaxed, right?
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.140]   They're rich, how do you have a bad day?
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.700]   Just relax, right?
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.140]   When you envision a good rich person,
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.980]   you probably assume that they are relaxed,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.180]   at peace, and generous, right?
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.020]   They're ready to share.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.700]   They're exactly what 1 Timothy 6 says they should be.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.500]   But we have got a nation of rich people.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.420]   This is, America is Disney World to the rest of history,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.620]   not just to the rest of the globe,
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.760]   but to the rest of history.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.460]   And we are the worst rich people in history.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.300]   Depression rates have skyrocketed
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.020]   as America's wealth has continued to rise.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.740]   We are not good at being rich.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.580]   We are not good at this thing of having wealth.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.380]   It's like we're worried about going hungry
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.740]   and we live in a permanent Thanksgiving.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.460]   It's like, somebody wake up and see what's going on.
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.140]   We are not good at being rich.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.180]   And the text says right here, if you will do good,
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.140]   if you will be rich in good works,
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.620]   okay, this has to do with other people.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.700]   This doesn't have to do with you.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.580]   To be rich in good works, be generous,
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.220]   and ready to give something, and you will store up,
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.280]   get this, treasure for yourself
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.700]   as a good foundation for your future.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.100]   Now, I don't want you to miss what that means.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.700]   When it says for the future, it does not mean on earth.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.820]   Okay, God is not guaranteeing that if you put dollars in,
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.460]   God is going to give you dollars back.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.620]   He could work that way.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.980]   He can do whatever he wants.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.660]   But if anyone teaches that you,
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.460]   if you will just give your cash,
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.860]   God will give the cash back to you.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.500]   You know, if you need that 10,000,
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.300]   just drop that 100 in and watch God work.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.020]   Anybody who says that,
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.000]   that as if they know that God is going to give you
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.320]   material earthly currency, they are off.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.120]   This guarantee is in the future.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.060]   That's why it says for the future,
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.160]   so that you can take hold of that,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.840]   which is truly life giving.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.980]   And real riches aren't what you have.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.940]   It's who you serve.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.440]   That's one of the reasons why I love serving
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.080]   at the porch in Fort Worth.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.100]   I love it because I get to be around people
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.120]   who have decided, you know what, this is not gonna be,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.640]   my life on earth is not gonna be,
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.360]   my few minutes on earth before all of my stuff is gone
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.020]   are not gonna be about what I can collect.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.600]   They're gonna be about what I can give.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.720]   And we've got a group of people over there
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.160]   from every occupation you can possibly imagine.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.280]   All right, we've got nurses,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.480]   we've got oil and gas landmen,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.960]   we've got students, we've got teachers,
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.240]   we've got physicians assistants,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.880]   physicians assistants students.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.240]   There's like nine hospitals in Fort Worth
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.080]   or something crazy.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.440]   I mean, it's just huge all in a big clump.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.780]   So it's like a ton of medical.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.480]   And so we've got people all over the place
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.320]   from every occupation.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.000]   I don't know what a single one of them makes,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.840]   except my wife.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.560]   I don't know what a single person on our team makes.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   I know this, they have decided to be rich
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.200]   in the way they live their life.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.100]   They have decided to give away their lives
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.360]   for the sake of Christ, for the sake of the gospel.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.240]   They have decided that they wanna be rich
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.920]   instead of endlessly trying to get rich.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.960]   They've decided, you know what,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.000]   what I wanna do is I wanna live a life
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.880]   that is consistent with what this book says.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.680]   And with what the book says is to be generous
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.080]   in the way that I handle other people,
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.200]   be ready to share, not ready to collect.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.380]   And I don't know what life is gonna look like in heaven,
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.160]   but I suspect for them it's gonna be really good.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.260]   And the same for you if you're doing this.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.080]   And the Bible promises you'll be rewarded.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.120]   And some of you, I know, you just go,
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.800]   man, I don't wanna be generous to be rewarded.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.100]   But the Bible says you're gonna get one anyway,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.200]   even if you don't want one.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.700]   'Cause God's good in that way.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.360]   So in summary, don't pursue wealth
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.320]   because you're guaranteed to lose your money.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.400]   Don't pursue wealth because your loving of money
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400]   is self-destructive.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.060]   And then lastly, be rich in good works.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.300]   Be generous to other people,
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.040]   and you will be a good, rich person for a change.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.600]   'Cause 1 Timothy 6 has a word for you
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.780]   and what to do with all your wealth.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.500]   And even if you don't think you have it.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.160]   And I know some of you maybe have been sitting there,
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.040]   I should've said this earlier,
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.240]   but some of you may be sitting there going,
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.040]   you know what, I'm not trying to get rich, man.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.840]   I'm just trying to get out of debt, amen.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.560]   You know, like I'm not trying to get rich, dude.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.840]   Like I'm just trying to get out of debt.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.020]   I just wanna tell you, I get debt.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.960]   I have found myself in debt.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.960]   Medical debt, private school education debt, twice, okay?
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.280]   House, car, the whole deal, man.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.180]   Like I have been under a mountain of debt.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.480]   And I wanna tell you, sprinting to get a dollar of debt
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.160]   off the books is the same thing as sprinting
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.140]   to get a dollar of income on the books
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.240]   because it's hope in wealth.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.940]   You gotta handle things responsibly, not obsessively.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.460]   Paying debt obsessively is the same thing
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.120]   as going to get income obsessively.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.000]   Trust God and be rich.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.300]   Stop trying to get rich and just be rich.
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.800]   We're gonna give you a chance to do that next week.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.080]   So next week, we're not gonna gather in this place, all right?
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.400]   So here in Dallas, we will not have a porch.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.140]   Let it be known, we will not have a porch
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.160]   in the traditional sense next Tuesday night.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.920]   In Fort Worth, we will not have a porch
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.800]   in the traditional sense.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.660]   If you show up to either one of those two places,
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.920]   you'll be very patriotic and you'll be very alone.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.860]   So do not come to the porch next Tuesday night.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.960]   What we are gonna do is we are gonna allow you,
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.620]   we're not gonna take on the red, white, and blue.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.560]   We know you got plans.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.060]   And so here's what you can do.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.080]   Be bold where you are.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.940]   Have the most generous 4th of July you've ever had.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.080]   That means picking up a meal, pick up a meal.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.540]   But I know what this, I know what we want it to include.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.960]   Generosity with your time, generosity with your intention,
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.920]   or with your attention, with the way you focus.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.080]   Put your phone down and pay attention
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.640]   to your family for a minute, you know?
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.920]   Go with your friends and get into their lives a little bit.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.700]   Talk to them, and especially, especially,
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.760]   look for your opportunity wherever you are,
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.280]   whatever environment you go into on the 4th of July,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.700]   whatever environment you go into,
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.040]   look for a chance to be bold about the Savior
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.600]   who really set you free.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.360]   And that's why we're gonna hand you,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.760]   if you need some help with that, if you need a prop,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.240]   what we're gonna do is we're gonna hand you one of these.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.160]   Okay, and so this is a red, white, and blue band.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.320]   It says, "Be bold on it," okay?
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.820]   And so let that be a reminder to you,
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.360]   wherever you are, that when you see that,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.320]   you want to move yourself toward a bold conversation,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.400]   not hanging out at the lake, drinking Natty Light,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.440]   all right, stay away from that, that ain't gonna help you,
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.200]   all right, but a sense of intentionality, okay?
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.240]   A sense of urgency, a sense of,
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.200]   I'm gonna live my life in front of you
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.120]   maybe different than I ever have before,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.080]   and I want to show you who it is
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.960]   that has caused me to live in this way.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.020]   The most generous way that you can spend
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.800]   the Fourth of July is to share with someone
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.360]   the hope that you have in Christ,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.800]   the freedom that you have in Christ.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.500]   Ask somebody if they have a faith.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.400]   Ask somebody if they've been to church.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.740]   Ask somebody if they'll just listen to your story.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.180]   If they're not comfortable engaging in a thing,
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.680]   I know some of you are like, oh no,
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.400]   this is the stuff I hate, I can't talk to people like this.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.200]   The introverts' knees are like shaking right now.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.880]   I'm telling you, just ask someone
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.320]   if they'll listen to your story,
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.360]   and then you can just share the way Christ has saved you.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.240]   That is our hope.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.440]   Every one of you in Dallas and Fort Worth
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.280]   are gonna get one of these,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.640]   and you hang onto it for next week.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   Wear it on the Fourth of July,
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.960]   and celebrate the United States.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.860]   I love it, I'm a patriot, but I'm telling you what,
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.560]   I'm not loyal to the United States
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.100]   above my relationship with Christ, not even close.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.480]   And so make that day an opportunity
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.960]   to be rich in the real way.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.200]   Let's pray together.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.640]   Father, my prayer this evening, our prayer this evening
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   is that you would launch a group of young adults
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.880]   into the city by the hundreds, by the thousands, God,
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.400]   that you would raise up a generation,
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.020]   continue to raise up a generation that will speak boldly,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.160]   they'll be bold, they won't be sidetracked
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.080]   by the customs of the day, by the holidays of the day,
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.400]   but God, we will live a generous lifestyle
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.700]   in the way that we engage with those around us.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.560]   God, help us to stop bowing down to the almighty dollar,
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.620]   God, we don't wanna spend 50 more years chasing money
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.120]   and then coming face to face with you
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.240]   and wondering why another day,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.740]   another dollar sounded better.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:17.500]   God, when we see you at the end of our life,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.560]   when all of our net worth just falls to the ground,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.600]   we wanna know that we were rich on earth
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.240]   in the way you said, God,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.960]   not in the way Dallas or Fort Worth said,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.820]   not in the way Houston said, not in the way America said,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.160]   but in the way you said, God, we were generous,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.040]   we were ready to share,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.340]   we were ready to share our hope in Christ,
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.000]   we were ready to share a defense for the faith
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.500]   and the hope that's within us.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:43.020]   God, preserve our faith by helping us turn back now.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.840]   Corporate America is not worth us bowing down to.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.600]   God, help us to stop resisting church membership
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.140]   because we're trying to get a career launched.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.880]   Help us just to go in where you want us to go.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.480]   We're not good at being rich, God,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.760]   you've given us material wealth
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.600]   and we're not good at it, God,
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.040]   and so we ask you for spiritual wealth
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.720]   and we wait for you, in Jesus' name, amen.
