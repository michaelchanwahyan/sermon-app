[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:31.460]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.780]   Man, that was all an illustration.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.300]   Videos without audio can be a little awkward.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.340]   Similar to dating can be a little awkward.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.380]   And no, hey, gosh, you guys look so good, man.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.060]   It has been way too long, and we are so pumped and so excited
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.820]   for everybody to be back.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.180]   And if people were not thirsty before COVID,
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.980]   it is only increased from there.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.820]   So we are covering a very appropriate--
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.140]   this was already on the calendar,
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.740]   and then we knew when we were going to come back.
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.660]   But hey, just to welcome again everybody in the room
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.540]   right here.
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.260]   The loft is also full.
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.900]   Everyone up in the loft, welcome.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.820]   Stage two is also full, and we are now
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.540]   gathering out in the auditorium.
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.140]   And now, welcome, of course, everybody
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.500]   online in the 13 locations from around the country--
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500]   Tulsa, El Paso, Houston, Northwest Arkansas,
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.900]   everybody that is getting back.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.820]   But we are so pumped to be starting, really kicking off
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.780]   this series as we look at Matchmaker.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.380]   Let me bring you guys into a little bit of my dating world,
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.940]   which is a long time ago.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.860]   This is the first car that I ever drove
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.340]   and the first car that I ever took a girl on a date in.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.500]   This is a 19--
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.940]   thank you very much.
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.380]   Don't want to brag, that's a 1993 Pontiac Sunbird
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.100]   convertible.
[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.460]   Yes, typically only ladies and cheerleaders drive that car,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.980]   but I got it from my sister and inherited that car.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.860]   You may be thinking, that's a cool car.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.940]   Nope, you're probably thinking of the Pontiac Firebird.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.340]   This was their less cool, nerdy cousin, the Sunbird.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.460]   I drove this car, and here's what the problem with that car
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.960]   was.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.460]   The driver's side door did not open,
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.620]   which created significant problems when I would go ever
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.300]   on a date because it led to me going over to the passenger
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.500]   side and you would think being chivalrous and opening
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   their door.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740]   But no, it was just me being like, actually, me first.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.500]   And I'd hop over the console in order to get in the car.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   So it wasn't exactly like the chick mobile
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   to be picking up ladies.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.140]   But around that time that I started to drive
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.900]   was also when I was introduced to dating
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.740]   and what that even looked like.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.420]   And the same is true for a lot of people.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.300]   It's around that time in life where you begin to drive
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.260]   and for whatever reason, you just also
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.860]   were introduced to a lot of your friends
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.500]   and people just begin to form relationships.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.620]   I know you do that in middle school, but everybody knows.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.700]   It doesn't really count middle school.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.820]   You just pass notes and you're like, we're talking.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.540]   But in high school, you're beginning to date
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.260]   and you're also beginning to drive.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.420]   What's interesting is there's a lot of similarities
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.580]   between dating and driving.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580]   Dating has been around about a hundred years,
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.740]   almost the exact amount of time that the automobile
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.580]   has been around.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.700]   In other words, they were introduced really into culture
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.540]   around the same amount of time.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.220]   And like dating, driving comes with significant risks.
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.100]   Every year, millions of people have life-altering damage
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.700]   done to their body from getting in car wrecks,
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.740]   millions in America.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.240]   40,000 people a year die from getting in a car crash.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.860]   And in a similar way, as it relates to dating,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.020]   although the casualties are usually not life and death,
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.780]   they are significant when it comes to your heart,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.060]   your future, your love life, and even your marriage.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.460]   Some of the most painful things really
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.620]   that people are walking through in the room,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.340]   maybe that you've ever walked through in your life
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.820]   was a relationship that took a turn for the worse
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.380]   that didn't end up working out.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.740]   And unlike driving, where they don't have a similarity,
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.140]   is in order to drive, there's certain requirements
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.980]   that are a part of it.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.220]   You have to be a certain number of years old.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.300]   You have to be at least 16,
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.900]   or if you got that hardship license,
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.940]   you got a little bit early, there was requirements.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.220]   In fact, usually you have to go through driver's ed.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.300]   But there's no such thing with dating.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.620]   There's no dater's ed, and there's no age requirements.
[00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.100]   And so people are just kind of left to plunge
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.780]   into the deep end on their own,
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.820]   and oftentimes in a way that leads
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.740]   to really dysfunctional relationships
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.060]   and a lot of pain and a lot of hurt.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.020]   Hurt that doesn't go away.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.540]   Hurt that they carry and end up carrying
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.900]   into future and future relationships.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.140]   And God doesn't want you to experience that.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.020]   So we're gonna cover this series,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.620]   what it looks like to be single, to be engaged,
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.280]   to be dating, and just cover what God says
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.940]   as it relates to the topic of romance and love.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.860]   The Bible doesn't specifically address dating.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.040]   Maybe it surprised you,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.700]   but just like it doesn't specifically address Instagram
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.620]   or avocado toast, because they weren't around
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.260]   2,000 years ago.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.580]   But it has a lot to say about love,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.880]   romance, marriage, and decision-making,
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.160]   which is essentially what dating is.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.220]   And God's heart is that you would navigate this minefield,
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.380]   that you would learn how to drive the car of dating
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.020]   in a way that doesn't lead you into a love life wreck,
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.740]   but towards a marriage that that's His will for you,
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.940]   is the type of marriage that you wanna have.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.300]   Next to who you're gonna worship as your God,
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.540]   there is no more important,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.020]   listen to me very closely on this,
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.500]   there is no bigger decision that you're gonna make
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.120]   than who you're gonna marry.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.420]   More than where you're gonna work,
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.480]   more than where you're gonna live,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.620]   your life is gonna be altered by who you decide to marry.
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.980]   It is a huge deal.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.260]   And we live in a country where 50% of people
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.540]   who end up standing in front of one another
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.260]   and pledging in a tux and in white dress,
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.280]   and they're like, "I love you forever,"
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.980]   ride or die, months or years later,
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.800]   end up signing papers where they say,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.960]   "I never want you in my life," and divorce.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.040]   God doesn't want that in your story,
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.620]   He doesn't want any more heartbreak in your story,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.780]   and my guess is you don't either.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.180]   So we're gonna launch into this conversation tonight
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.300]   for the next handful of weeks
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.820]   about what it looks like to navigate
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.900]   these waters really well.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.220]   The other thing that has spiked in COVID,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.580]   in addition to Purell and Clorox, is online dating.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.900]   There's been a 600% increase in certain dating apps,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.900]   whether that's Hinge or Bumble or OkCupid or Tinder,
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.820]   or Farmers Only, JD, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   And whatever it is, there's been a dramatic upgrace.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.460]   And so part of the matchmaker thing,
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.340]   that bumper you couldn't actually hear the audio for,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.500]   is playing off of that idea.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.120]   We don't have a porch dating app,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.460]   but this is our like, you know,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.540]   playing off of that idea of matchmaker
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.740]   and how to make sure that you end up with a match
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.700]   that is in line with what your maker would say.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.020]   And so throughout the series,
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.340]   we're gonna integrate some of the common language
[00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.340]   as it relates to even a dating app, if you will.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.700]   Tonight, I wanna talk about your dating profile.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.480]   And by that, I don't mean what's currently listed
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.500]   on your Bumble account,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.060]   I mean by dating profile, your single life, who you are.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.640]   Not the description you have on your Facebook,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.120]   but a description of who you are in reality.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.640]   Who God calls you to be in this season.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.280]   And how to make sure that you use this season
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.800]   or you set up your dating profile
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.180]   to lead you in the best chance scenario
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.360]   of ending up with the type of person
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.200]   that you wanna end up with.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   So tonight, if you take notes,
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.760]   we're talking about your dating profile,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.680]   we're learning scriptural principles to inform
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.280]   what it looks like to set up your dating profile.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.240]   And by that, again, I mean your single life.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.380]   So we're gonna launch in what your dating profile says
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.520]   or what it is, what is at stake,
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.760]   depending on what is in your dating profile.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.400]   And for some of us, or many of us, maybe all of us,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.000]   what you need to and how to change
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.820]   what's in your dating profile.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.520]   So we're gonna just walk through,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.640]   again, when I say dating profile,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.800]   I mean focusing on you.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.020]   This is huge.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.680]   Like before you move on to any other step,
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.800]   even if you're dating someone right now,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.120]   you need to be asking the question,
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.720]   what is in my dating profile?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.560]   Like what is my life, what marks my life,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.880]   what habits does no one know about?
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.320]   Maybe habits people do know about,
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.660]   but what type of character am I building?
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.240]   What is your dating profile?
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.800]   Before you move on to any other step,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.840]   addressing what is in your profile,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.120]   what marks your life, what is a part of it.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.680]   Before you focus on who to date,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.800]   focus on the you that will date them,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.840]   which is really difficult.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.800]   And let me just be honest, inside the room,
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.320]   this seems like the least fun thing.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.920]   And I know that what comes most natural
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.400]   is not evaluating like what does mark my life
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.660]   and what are the habits that I really need
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.920]   to address right now?
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   What comes a lot more natural is who is she?
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.760]   Some of you, since you walked in the room,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.520]   since I began talking, you have not been listening
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.120]   to what I've been saying because you have been thinking,
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.320]   I wonder who that is.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.640]   Is he friends with Kevin?
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.400]   Oh my gosh, I wonder if we should all like get together
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.140]   and how could I create a hypothetical situation
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.000]   or forced environment for us to have friends
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.840]   that go together like torches afterwards.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.160]   And really, I don't really care about the friends,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.640]   but I can't get around him, that would be awkward.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.020]   So maybe, and you've been thinking about that person,
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.040]   you've been checking out their shoes,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.400]   he seems like he's responsible,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.300]   that has some fashion sense to him.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.400]   Or she seems like, you know, she loves Jesus,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.400]   her hands were raised during worship, that was cool.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.520]   'Cause it's so natural and easy to drift towards, huh, them.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.320]   Before you go there, tonight, I wanna focus
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.040]   and call you to focus on not on who to date,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.700]   but on the you that will date
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.460]   and addressing your dating profile.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.920]   So the first idea, what is in your dating profile?
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.720]   Not what do you want people to know,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.980]   not what would you list on Bumble,
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.360]   but what, if somebody saw everything about your life,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.720]   what would God list out inside of your dating profile?
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.020]   That dating profile, you're gonna bring into marriage.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.320]   In other words, when you get married someday,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.200]   what marks your life, the profile of your life,
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.560]   and the profile of her life or his life,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.360]   are gonna be combined into one profile.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.600]   What are you gonna be bringing in?
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.120]   Jesus said this idea of combining lives
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.440]   and combining profiles in Matthew chapter 19,
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.740]   verse five and six, he said this,
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.640]   this is what marriage is, this is Jesus's words.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.360]   Marriage is when a man leaves his father and mother
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.080]   and is united to his wife, and the two become one flesh.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.720]   You're gonna bring everything that's in your profile
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.880]   into your future marriage.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.520]   What is in your dating profile?
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.920]   So we put together some of the profiles
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.480]   that typically kind of mark what people end up
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.820]   listing out there when they manicure and manage
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.200]   on a dating app profile, you know,
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.400]   the perception that they want someone
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.540]   to think of them about.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:02.880]   And here was some of the ones that we put up.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   These are just fake people.
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.040]   Actually, Danny's in the room,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.860]   he's on row four right here, not true.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.560]   Danny, here's what he would have just hypothetically
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.320]   went to Tamu, whoop.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.000]   Likes going out with the boys,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.040]   saving private Ryan is the only movie,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.960]   only thing that makes me cry.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.040]   Let's go two-stepping sometime, got to.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.880]   Favorites, of course, travel reading coffee,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.800]   looking for someone who loves the office
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.060]   and is a Christian, and he once climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.840]   There's one example of a dating profile, here's Allison.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.880]   Allison works at the Richards Group,
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.520]   that's a company here in Dallas, loves to travel,
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.200]   see new things, just a small town girl
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.960]   living in a lonely world, got to.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.680]   Ah, love that, got some wit, got to.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.540]   My family means everything to me.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.760]   Here for a good time.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.000]   Her favorites, baking, SoulCycle, and Jesus.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.720]   Exactly everything she thinks men are looking for.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.440]   Looking for someone down-to-earth, funny, trustworthy,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.080]   and fun fact about me, I have a dog,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.680]   I'm a dog mom to my corgi named Lucy.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.760]   All right, next one, Michael.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.120]   Ah, look at that smile, it's a great pic.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.220]   Played soccer in college, I love playing guitar,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.360]   I have my own business, holla.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.880]   I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.640]   My favorites would be family, fitness, and faith,
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.320]   and I am looking for an Enneagram nine
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.620]   with an adventurous side.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.540]   Very specific, Michael, you're really limiting your options.
[00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.160]   I once backpacked through Europe in the summer,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.960]   and I think our final one, oh, Kate, of course.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.160]   Man, we have a great photographer
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.340]   who took these people's picture.
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.920]   Love to laugh, and I'm always happy.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.000]   I'm a professional at watching Netflix.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.480]   I am the best me when I am outside.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.920]   Communication, is that spelled right?
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.600]   Kate, that is not spelled right.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.280]   Communication is key.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.880]   And she watched less Netflix,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.040]   and worked a little harder on her profile.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.320]   My favorite things are lattes, guac, and margs.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.780]   My Bible, I'm looking for someone who's strong
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.620]   and dependable.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.140]   Fun fact about me, I'm always down for a 5K
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.780]   with a good cause.
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.340]   Now, what would these profiles say
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.020]   if they were entirely honest?
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.100]   Like, in other words, what are the things that,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.740]   you know, likely, just like in your profile,
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.460]   if you were making one, you're not gonna list online,
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.900]   but they are listed in your life.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.780]   Here would be the first one.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.100]   Danny.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.780]   Uh, I didn't actually go to TAMU.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.380]   I went to Blinn.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.060]   That's all right, Danny.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.760]   I get blackout drunk every weekend.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.500]   I am emotionally unavailable.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.060]   I do things girls like just so they will hook up with me.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.580]   My favorites, video games for three hours a day,
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.340]   and dressing girls around me in my mind.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.700]   Looking for someone who's blonde
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.800]   and has big boobs to have sex with.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.840]   Fun fact about me, I'm addicted to porn.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.260]   Now, those are things that he would never mention
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.500]   or never bring out of the light,
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.420]   but he's bringing them into a relationship.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.660]   Allison.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.180]   I flirt with my boss to get ahead.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.660]   I get guys to pay for my vacations.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.940]   I haven't spoken to my parents in over a year.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.700]   I laugh about getting arrested that one time.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.180]   My favorites include letting jealousy
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.940]   control my relationships,
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.300]   looking for someone to project my past baggage
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.280]   from men onto,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.820]   and fun fact about me, I have an eating disorder.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.740]   And then Michael.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.060]   I keep Xanax around in case of emergency situations.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.800]   I use my musical talents to impress women.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.620]   I've got 20K in credit card debt.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.500]   I've punched multiple holes in my wall.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.060]   My favorites include drunk Snapchatting with my ex.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.460]   I'm looking for someone without a backbone
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.900]   whose life I can control.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.900]   Fun fact about me, I have an anger problem,
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.440]   and I've cheated on my past two girlfriends.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.820]   And then of course, Kate.
[00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.980]   If Kate was entirely honest,
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.660]   her profile would include,
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.600]   anxiety controls my relationship.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.480]   I don't really have much ambition.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.100]   I find myself feeling too depressed to get out of bed.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.460]   If you try to leave me, I will find you.
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.500]   My favorites include drinking a bottle of wine every night
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.420]   because I don't like my life,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.780]   and I'm looking for someone,
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.660]   if I was honest, to fill a hole my absent dad left,
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.420]   and make me feel good about myself.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.860]   Fun fact about me, I'm emotionally unstable,
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.720]   and will make you feel crazy, 'cause I'm crazy.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.060]   Now no one would ever include those,
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:50.100]   but those are the type of things that mark people,
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.580]   many of us all over the room.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.340]   And the profile you list online
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.560]   may not come with you into the future,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.820]   but the profile that is actually your life will.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:06.300]   And right now, what you're carrying around,
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.620]   is not just gonna determine the person
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.460]   you're gonna end up with,
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.060]   as we'll talk about here in a second.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.860]   It is shaping the future marriage that you're gonna have.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:20.180]   And you get to decide, what is gonna mark my life?
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.580]   What is gonna be the profile that I carry into marriage?
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.740]   What's gonna be the things that I bring in,
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.900]   and bring forward?
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.140]   'Cause someday, if you end up married together,
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.700]   you're gonna combine your baggage, and her baggage,
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.700]   your profile, and her profile.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.460]   And so many people are good at falling in love.
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.100]   It is very easy to fall in love with people around you.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.560]   There are beautiful girls in here,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.020]   there are handsome guys in here,
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.260]   you could fall in love tonight.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.300]   Staying in love is much more difficult.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.360]   And one of the reasons that people don't stay in love,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.500]   is they never address their profile,
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.300]   long before they ever met Mr. Right, or Mrs. Right.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.100]   When I got married to my wife,
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.940]   we went on a honeymoon,
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.660]   which is like our first real vacation together.
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.240]   Just two of us were so pumped.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.980]   We're flying out of the country,
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.740]   and going to this Mexico all-inclusive resort,
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.580]   just so stoked.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.540]   We go to the airport,
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.460]   and this is like the first time
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.340]   I'd ever traveled with her before.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.500]   And I began to realize,
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.020]   women are very different in terms of packing.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.460]   Like, when guys think of packing,
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.300]   it's like, all right,
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.120]   we're gonna do a backpack,
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.960]   and we're just gonna go right through,
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.900]   and no checking bags.
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.180]   When women, and particularly on the honeymoon,
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.020]   think of it, I mean,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.840]   she's bringing like cargo I've never even seen before.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.680]   She's got the blow dryer,
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.520]   she's got the hair curler,
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.340]   she's got hair things,
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.260]   I don't even know what they are.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.580]   She's got all kinds of like a tackle box of makeup,
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.140]   and 17 different pairs of shoes,
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.540]   and it's just, what's gonna happen?
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.180]   And as we go up to check in our bags,
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.660]   and begin to go through the process
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.580]   of going through security,
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.720]   and getting to the airport,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.940]   I realized that my bag and her bag
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:50.820]   were very, very different.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.260]   And we put her bag on the scale,
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.140]   and it was 15 pounds over the weight limit for her bag.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.980]   We put mine on,
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.140]   and it was like seven pounds.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.340]   So of course, it was like,
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.180]   take that off,
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.020]   we're putting all of our,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.780]   lots of your stuff into my bag,
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.380]   so that we can escape paying the extra fees on there.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.980]   Really in marriage,
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.240]   that's what happens.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.580]   Not just that you share luggage
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.300]   when you're going to a destination,
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.660]   you're gonna share the baggage
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.100]   of the person that you marry,
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.600]   and they're gonna share yours.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.000]   What is that baggage?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.520]   Maybe tonight, the only step you need to take
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.860]   is just being honest with yourself.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:31.240]   Here's the stuff that I'm carrying in my profile.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.000]   I can't go a week without turning to weed,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.200]   'cause my anxiety's through the roof.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.560]   I don't like myself,
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.800]   because I was a cheerleader,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.240]   and I got injured in college,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.920]   and I've defined myself by that moment ever since.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.860]   I don't like the way that I look.
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.680]   I was sexually abused.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.260]   What's in your profile?
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.460]   Because what is at stake
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.700]   is the most significant relationship
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.100]   other than the one with God you will ever have,
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.700]   and your ability to maintain it.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.600]   What do I mean?
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.540]   What's at stake,
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.060]   or why your profile matters,
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.000]   is that whatever's in your profile,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.840]   your life,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.260]   it's not going away when you get married.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.980]   Like, there's this weird fantasy idea that like,
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.180]   oh yeah, then when you get married,
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.140]   then you become an adult,
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.500]   and you stop doing that.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.820]   That doesn't happen.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.340]   And I've stood by too many people
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.300]   who ended up getting married,
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.460]   ended up years, or weeks, or months,
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.780]   getting divorced and walking away,
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.900]   and it was because they never dealt
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.220]   with the issues inside of their life,
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.620]   the problems they thought would just go away.
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.980]   They never went away, they got worse.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.900]   In marriage, they don't disappear,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.440]   they get exposed,
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   or if anything, they get even worse.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.580]   It doesn't fix your problems.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.740]   Paul, in the Bible, says it adds to your problems.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.200]   So waiting till marriage to deal with them
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.780]   is only gonna be a time when the problems get even worse.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.980]   He says this in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.800]   verse 31.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.920]   "I want you to be free from anxieties."
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.080]   He's talking about singleness and marriage.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.440]   He says, "The unmarried man is anxious
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.080]   "about the things of the Lord and how to please Him.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.360]   "The married man is anxious about worldly things,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.460]   "how to please his wife.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.460]   "His interests are divided."
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.100]   In other words, particularly the guys,
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.020]   he's about to address the girls,
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.740]   but guys, when you get married, life changes radically.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.660]   Today, if you wanted to, I bet you could go home,
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.900]   you could turn on the TV, you could watch sports,
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.900]   you could watch the Mavs, you could go on a jog,
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.740]   you could do whatever you want.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.980]   Someday, you're gonna end up married,
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.820]   and you're gonna end up spending time and money
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.340]   on things you never would have anticipated
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.280]   spending time and money on.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.560]   You're gonna get home from a long day of work,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.780]   you're not turning on the TV,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.480]   you're not just vegging out or going on a run,
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.640]   you're gonna sit there and you're gonna talk
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.480]   about how your day was.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.920]   And you're gonna have to sit there and process
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.440]   and talk through and give details
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.500]   about everything that's going on,
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.720]   and she's gonna want to know
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.980]   all the different aspects of her life,
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.940]   and then she's gonna wanna flip it
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.260]   and want you to talk and speak
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.620]   into all the aspects of her life.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.060]   She's gonna wanna know that you're listening
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.920]   and paying attention and you're verbally nodding along
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.740]   and that you're there not to try to fix her problems
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.900]   but just to hear and listen and empathize with.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.260]   And your life's gonna change.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.040]   And you're gonna spend money on things that, man,
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.020]   right now, you're like, "Dude, I can go spend money
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.180]   "on whatever I want, I may switch cars when I want,
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.500]   "I may move apartments, I got a lot of disposable income,
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.820]   "I do whatever I want with."
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.900]   Nope, not when you marry someday,
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.340]   you're gonna end up spending money on things
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.860]   that I have no idea why we have so many pillows in my house.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.460]   Duvets, duvets.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.020]   I didn't even know what a duvet was before we got married.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.660]   And now we have like three of them.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.460]   You're gonna spend money and have to spend,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.500]   if things are gonna break apart,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.340]   you're gonna have a mortgage,
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.740]   it's just life begins to change.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.820]   And Paul says, "Life doesn't get easier
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.600]   "and marriage is an amazing gift."
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.780]   And as someone married to one of the most low maintenance
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.500]   people I know of on the planet,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.900]   I just have seen that marriage, it changes your life.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.700]   So Paul, his point is not marriage is bad
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.780]   and singleness is good or singleness is bad and marriage,
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.780]   his point is, hey, marriage will not fix your problems.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.140]   He says the same thing to the ladies.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.180]   He says, "The unmarried woman is anxious
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.520]   "about things of the Lord,
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.720]   "but the married woman is anxious about worldly things,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.500]   "how to please her husband."
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:15.680]   Ladies, you're gonna get married someday, likely.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.740]   Statistically speaking, 90% of the people in the room
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.500]   will get married by age of 50 and you're gonna get married
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.580]   and here's what you're gonna understand
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.820]   or be exposed to about men.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.960]   They're not very clean.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.180]   Some of them are so not clean,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.320]   it's like they're reaching the danger zone
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.660]   in terms of their lifestyle.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.660]   And they're gonna end up wanting to do things
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.540]   or you're gonna find yourself going,
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.040]   man, I do not want to do that again.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.320]   This is not a lingerie night.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.100]   Again, it's me sitting on the couch wearing my comfy pants
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.520]   and I just want you to sit here and listen and talk with me.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.200]   There's gonna be challenges and things that are brought
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.860]   about through marriage and Paul's point is marriage
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.640]   does not make your problems go away.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.460]   If anything, it adds to the problems that are there.
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.300]   And then when you add kids into the mix,
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.580]   your discretionary time goes out the window.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.240]   This is such a unique season and stage in your life
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.200]   and marriage is amazing.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.600]   Kids are amazing.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.920]   Wouldn't change it for anything in the world.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.240]   My point is whatever is in your profile,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.580]   it's not gonna go away, it's not gonna get better
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.700]   just because you get married.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.240]   If anything, it's gonna get worse
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.800]   and it's gonna end up spilling out
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.320]   and end up impacting the relationships that you have.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.720]   It's not just similar to this.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.760]   This is a tuba chico.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.740]   It's a beverage in case you're not familiar with it.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.720]   Inside of this, like marriage,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.460]   if you shake it up, which is what marriage does,
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.240]   it's really what stress does to our life.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.720]   If you shake it up, there's a greater likelihood
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.520]   that eventually something's gonna spill out.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.340]   And the problem isn't that, you know,
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.560]   what is shaking it up 'cause life is full of stress
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.880]   and anxiety and challenges and problems and hardship
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.160]   and all of it you're gonna face.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.140]   But when that happens, what is inside is gonna come out.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:02.500]   That was a lot messier than I thought.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.160]   And the problem in marriage, and I promise you,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.660]   like it's just life.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.200]   You're gonna walk through miscarriages.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.160]   You're gonna have a parent that dies of cancer.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.860]   One of you is gonna lose your job.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.500]   And all of that shaking and all of that stress
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.700]   is gonna bring to the surface
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.120]   and what's inside is going to spill out.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.480]   I just want you to be honest with yourself.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.440]   What is inside?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.100]   The idea of someday, and I know you don't believe me,
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.200]   that's the most frustrating thing.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.920]   I haven't done this in the last 11 years.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.240]   It's people like, no, once I get married, I will grow up.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.080]   No, you won't.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.320]   You will grow up when you decide to grow up.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.060]   The only thing getting married will do
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.560]   is change your last name if you're a girl.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.360]   If you're a guy, won't even do that.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.440]   What are you bringing into marriage?
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.520]   Because what is at stake is the most important relationship
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.280]   other than the one with Christ that you will ever have.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.180]   So now, how to change your dating profile, the third idea.
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.740]   So what's in there, what's at stake,
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.620]   and then how to change your dating profile
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.660]   or taking the best next step.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.340]   As I said, 90% of you will get married by 50.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.660]   Statistically, 75% of young adults will get married by 35.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.700]   80% by 40.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.620]   So this time in your life,
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.700]   you have got like a decade for a lot of you,
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.300]   or give or take a little bit around a decade,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.740]   where likely you're gonna make the decision
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.140]   of the most important relationship you're gonna have
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.460]   in terms of an earthly one.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.880]   Before you get there, addressing your profile.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.600]   So how do you address your profile?
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.840]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, that same chapter,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.680]   that singleness, despite the fact that often
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.640]   we don't feel like it, is a gift.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.620]   And here's why I think we don't feel like it is a gift.
[00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.240]   Because we don't see it as something
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.420]   that God gave us for a season.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.680]   It's a unique time period for most people's lives.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.760]   In other words, for 90% of people in the world,
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.960]   or for 90% of Americans who end up getting married,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.920]   singleness is a season.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.260]   It's not some perpetual trap that they're caught in.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.100]   It's a season.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.320]   And Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7,
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.240]   it's a season that is a gift for two reasons.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.440]   He says it in verse 35.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.540]   I say this for your own benefit,
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.240]   not to put a restraint on you,
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.220]   talking about what singleness is for.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.100]   But singleness is to promote what is appropriate
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.680]   and secure, undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.440]   Paul says, hey, here's what singleness is for.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.160]   This is a season unique in your life
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.460]   that God gives every single person
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.160]   that you can take advantage of it.
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.020]   By using it to promote what is appropriate,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.020]   he lists two things.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.300]   And secure, undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.540]   What is promote what is appropriate?
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.060]   That means deal with your character, with issues.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.420]   Begin to live in community.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:48.660]   And confess that a pornography addiction marks your life
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.300]   and begin to regularly bring that out into the light.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.140]   Regularly call and confess that to other people around you.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.300]   You live in a world, men,
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.060]   where there are borderline problems with your life.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:58.960]   There are borderline naked women
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.400]   on every channel that you can flip through.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   And I'm talking about Victoria's Secret model commercials
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.720]   that come on there.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.540]   It's not crazy.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.440]   Most of us, like me,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.360]   were introduced to pornography at such a young age.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.120]   You think that it's any shock or surprise
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.360]   why that marks your life?
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.920]   But it doesn't have to.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.080]   And you can make a decision today.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.280]   I'm not gonna have this in my profile
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.160]   for the rest of the rest.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.360]   I'm not gonna bring this into my marriage
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.200]   where all of a sudden,
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.560]   the type of sex that I wanna have in marriage someday
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.600]   and the sexual fantasies that I want my wife to live out
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.900]   are defined by the pornography
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.740]   that I've consumed and am consuming.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.920]   'Cause I'm gonna choose to deal with that.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.760]   You make the decision, man,
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.260]   I'm gonna choose to deal with that problem with Xanax.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.260]   I'm gonna choose to deal with that eating disorder
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.180]   that I have because I hate myself.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.020]   Everyone talks about, you know,
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.140]   you're so pretty and I like all this,
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.260]   but I hate myself.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.420]   I hate myself.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.660]   And I'm gonna address not just the eating disorder,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.180]   I'm gonna address the roots that are underneath it
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.420]   and what's inside of it and what's behind it.
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.720]   In doing so, promoting what is good behavior.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.800]   That's what Paul's words is.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.880]   Hey, this is what you should be doing.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.840]   This is what you should be doing with your singleness.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.160]   Dealing with addictions, dealing with hurts.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.440]   Some of you were really, really wounded by a father,
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.320]   by a family member.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.280]   You're still really hurt from an ex you had in high school
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.120]   and you never forgave them.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.280]   You never forgave somebody who did like horrible,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.600]   painful things to you.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   Like was absent from your life for years and years and years
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.760]   and here's what I know.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.960]   Holding onto that is not just gonna hurt you,
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.560]   it's gonna hurt your future marriage
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.160]   'cause you're gonna project those hurts.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.200]   A person I've seen it so many times
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.360]   who is not able to forgive people from the past
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   will not be able to forgive a spouse in their present
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.960]   and they're gonna hold onto bitterness
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.840]   and they're gonna claim it's like,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.140]   no, I just have trust issues,
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.120]   but really it's because they've never forgiven people
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.960]   who've hurt them.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.160]   And then they get married
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.080]   and they've trained their whole life
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   to hold onto bitterness and hold onto hurts.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.680]   Are you gonna make the decision?
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.480]   I'm gonna work through that and recover from that.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.320]   Somebody sexually abused or raped me
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.720]   and you have the decision,
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.840]   are you to carry that for the rest of your life?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.320]   And that wasn't your fault and it was wrong
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.340]   and they're gonna give an account to God.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   But you have to be honest and give an account to yourself.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.460]   How long are you gonna let that define your life?
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:33.440]   How long are you gonna carry that in your profile?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.480]   Are you gonna work through the process
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.700]   of forgiving, of healing?
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.520]   This is why we hit on living in community
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.840]   to promote what is good behavior
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.440]   'cause all of us in isolation and on our own,
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.280]   we drift as Proverbs 18, one says
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.520]   and all throughout the Proverbs it says,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.000]   we just drift towards self-destructive tendencies
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.500]   that I need people in my life
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.720]   who can call out blind spots that I have,
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.760]   who could hold me accountable
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.800]   and come around and pray for me.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.600]   Do you have a small group of guys, a small group of girls?
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.160]   If you've been walking through COVID in isolation,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.840]   I know you've got stuff you gotta heal from.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.800]   And I know you're carrying things
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.840]   that you're not strong enough to carry
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.160]   like depression and anxiety
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.200]   and the things that we've been talking about
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.360]   for the last six weeks.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.440]   It's been said idiosyncrasies grow
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   in the garden of isolation.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.920]   In other words, like if you've ever met somebody
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.760]   and you're like, man, you're just a little bit off,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.440]   you're a little quirky.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.460]   Typically it's because they don't have anyone in their life
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.160]   who will tell them the truth,
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.520]   who will say, here's what I see, here's what marks your life.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.020]   Do you know that you're like this?
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.860]   Do you have community?
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.120]   If not, it will be really difficult.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.320]   It will be impossible to promote and use this season
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.520]   to build the character that will allow you
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.280]   to build a marriage that will last.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.840]   Second thing he says is secure,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.960]   undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.800]   Before you get a relationship with a guy or girl,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   you've got to get your relationship with God right.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.040]   This is the time to go all in on your faith.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.160]   So not use it to get it out of your system
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.660]   and kind of sow your wild oats.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.720]   Getting it out of your system,
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.080]   through sleeping around, living for the weekend,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.040]   that is how you get it in your system
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.460]   and in your profile.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.780]   This is a time to go all in and grow in your faith,
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.540]   to not use the weekend to just play Call of Duty
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.340]   and your cod squad,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:33.980]   but to invest, invest in knowing God's word,
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.740]   serving inside of a church, growing your character,
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.900]   and pursuing an undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.100]   Paul says this in Galatians chapter six,
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.540]   right now you are sowing seeds in your single life.
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.500]   What are you sowing?
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.940]   He says, do not be misled.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.740]   You cannot mock God.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.960]   You will always harvest what you plant.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.500]   Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful desires
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.860]   will harvest decay and death from sinful nature,
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.420]   but those who live to please the spirit
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.460]   will harvest everlasting life from the spirit.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.460]   He basically says, hey, whatever you planted today,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.340]   you're gonna reap those at a later time.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.380]   However you're living your life,
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.840]   those are gonna resurface again at a later time.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.800]   How did you use your weekend?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.660]   How are you using your time?
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.260]   Are you investing it in what actually matters?
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.420]   God's kingdom, building your character,
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.500]   serving inside of a church.
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.700]   Are you connected to a church?
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.180]   Are you spending time growing in his word?
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.900]   You know how much Bible you could learn
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.140]   in like six weeks around here
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.340]   with the number of classes that are available?
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.040]   Are you gonna use this as a foundation
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.740]   to become the type of person
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.460]   who invests in the most important thing about you?
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.560]   Let me be abundantly clear.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.880]   The most important thing about you
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.200]   and the person that you will marry
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.720]   is not something you can see.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.440]   It is what is on the inside.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.780]   And every single day, you have a decision to say,
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.320]   man, what am I investing in?
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.020]   How am I shaping my future marriage?
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.180]   How am I building into my character?
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.900]   How am I growing in my faith?
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.460]   And we spend so much time, and ladies,
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.140]   I'm not throwing shade at it,
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.900]   so much time looking a certain way,
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.740]   clipping up the eyebrows and getting everything
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.340]   all looking good on the outside,
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.940]   and neglect the most important thing,
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.300]   which you cannot see.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.240]   Which is on the inside.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.840]   And above any quality that you should look for,
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.360]   man, I've just, I remember being single,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.480]   and I know what it's like to be like,
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.920]   nah, I don't believe that.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.280]   I've done marriages of beautiful girls and handsome guys
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.360]   that claim to be walking with Jesus,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.640]   and they were hiding sin.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.880]   And those marriages are not together anymore.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.780]   The most important thing about you,
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.900]   and about the person you're gonna end up with,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.980]   is something you cannot see.
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.820]   It is what is on the inside.
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.340]   'Cause someday, it's like this,
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.820]   when I got married, my wife gave me this bracelet.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:53.020]   It's not a tremendously,
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.060]   you know, crazy, fancy bracelet.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.620]   It was just a bracelet of a bunch of fish hooks,
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.780]   and the fish hooks were basically
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:02.900]   accompanied with the letters.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.420]   On our wedding day, showed up at our room,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.220]   and we were like, oh, we're gonna get married.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.780]   And she was like, oh, I'm so excited.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.820]   Showed up at our room, she was like,
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.260]   hey, this is for the rest of our life,
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.300]   we're gonna spend it following Jesus
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.180]   and doing what he calls us to,
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.100]   fishing for men, Matthew chapter four.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.540]   Also on that day of my wedding,
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.540]   there was another gift.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.900]   There were lots of gifts that you ended up giving,
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.580]   but you are also, without even realizing it,
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.380]   you are giving to your spouse
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.680]   whatever is on the inside of your heart,
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.580]   of your life, of your soul, of your profile.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.000]   What are you going to give?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.140]   What is there?
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.340]   And are you gonna make the decision
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.660]   to be a Danny whose profile doesn't say,
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.300]   you know, I'm still addicted to pornography?
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.940]   Instead it says, I'm living authentically,
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.340]   I'm confessing, I'm living in the light.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.660]   Instead of being a Kate who's saying,
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.420]   yeah, hey, I deal with alcohol
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.260]   in order to work through my oppression,
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.340]   and I'm emotionally unstable
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.660]   'cause I've never forgiven my dad,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.600]   it says I have worked through and recovered from
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.040]   the hurt and the past.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:03.700]   In my heart, what is your profile going to say?
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.580]   You get to decide, you have to decide.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:10.820]   And that decision will define and shape
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.140]   the type of relationship you're gonna have in the future
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.660]   and the type of person you're gonna end up with in general.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:19.060]   Dating also shares, I'm about to land the plane,
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.120]   another similarity when it comes to driving.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.820]   Dating like driving,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.740]   driving is something you do
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.440]   whenever you want to go someplace.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.520]   You get in the car to move from one destination
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.780]   to another destination.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.100]   Biblically, that is the point and purpose of dating.
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.100]   You get there in order to move in the destination,
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.560]   not of casual fun, but the destination of marriage.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.460]   If you're not interested in going somewhere,
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.340]   don't get in a car.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.260]   If you're not interested in moving towards marriage,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.180]   don't start dating.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.140]   And if you are not healthy, you should not be dating.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.380]   If you've got stuff in your profile,
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.420]   you're like, man, this is just toxic,
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.200]   you should not be dating.
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.060]   If there's an addiction that you're hiding,
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.060]   you're not living in the light, you should not be dating.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.500]   If you're not in community,
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.180]   I'm not sure you should be dating.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:15.180]   Conclusion, what's in your profile really?
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.260]   What is at stake could not be bigger.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.000]   And the way you change with it
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.200]   is by seeking to use your singleness
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.980]   to promote what is appropriate behavior
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.520]   and to go all in with Christ, living in community,
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.780]   confessing sin, working through past hurts.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.520]   And if you do, there is no limit to the story
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.620]   that God is gonna write.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.500]   There's no person whose profile in here
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.400]   is so damaged and scarred and messed up
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.600]   that God can't write an amazing, beautiful, incredible story.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.860]   Every person in the loft right now,
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.140]   every person in stage two, every person in El Paso,
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.980]   every person in Houston, every person in Fort Worth,
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.800]   every single person, if you are willing to say,
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.020]   God, I'm gonna go all in with you.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.220]   Like, I know the fear is that,
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.840]   hey, you've done so many things wrong,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.460]   you're like, man, just I'm damaged goods,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.180]   a godly guy will never be interested in me.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:03.020]   That is a lie.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.500]   Godly guys don't look for perfection,
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.060]   they look for someone who's pursuing Jesus
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.420]   with their heart, regardless of their past,
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.460]   who knows that there's a God who is there,
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.020]   named Jesus, who changed his profile for you and for me,
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.580]   the profile of the perfect son of God,
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.780]   forever, eternally in heaven, without sin,
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.580]   who became the sinful one on me.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.700]   He took all of the sexual sin in my past,
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.820]   every look at pornography,
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.320]   every abortion represented in the room,
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.540]   every time that you've ever gotten wasted on the weekend,
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.060]   all of it and all the shame,
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.860]   everything was taken on Jesus,
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.500]   and his profile went from perfect
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.740]   to covered in your sin and my sin,
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.540]   so that your profile for all of eternity
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.580]   would not be defined by the actions that you have,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.220]   your relationship status, but what he did on the cross.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.980]   If you have trusted him, you are forgiven.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.100]   You shouldn't walk in shame,
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.660]   you shouldn't walk like you're damaged goods,
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.860]   you can continue to walk saying,
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.220]   man, I'm gonna become a godly person.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.220]   I'm gonna work on my character right now,
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.340]   'cause ultimately, I wanna marry a godly person,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.680]   and godly people marry godly people,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.900]   so I'm gonna put that number one,
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.940]   I'm gonna prioritize that, not just because of that,
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.680]   but because that is what life has found.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.460]   You're not defined by your past.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.460]   And until you know your maker,
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.660]   looking for a match will be foolish.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.620]   So those of you who have never trusted in Jesus tonight
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.140]   is your night, 'cause you're not defined
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.300]   by what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.980]   You aren't, when Jesus or God looks at you,
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.900]   someone who's blanket statement, forgiven, pure, my child.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.040]   You're still covered by your sin.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.560]   You've never accepted the free gift Jesus extended
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.460]   when he gave his life on the cross for you.
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.680]   That's what it means to be a Christian,
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.240]   is I accepted the free gift that God became a man.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.400]   He died on my place, he paid for everything.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.920]   I'm not defined by my shame,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.280]   'cause I've trusted in the one who saves,
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.680]   Jesus, who died for me, and rose from the dead,
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.000]   and I will too, and now I'm invited
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.780]   to continue to work on my character,
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.960]   to grow and address my profile,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.600]   before I move it into that next relationship,
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.200]   that second, to my first love,
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.080]   and my first relationship of importance with him.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.260]   Let me pray.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.360]   Father, I do pray for every person in the room
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.140]   who is covered in shame.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.940]   They feel like there isn't hope for them.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.520]   They've done things that they regret,
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.320]   and they're ashamed of, and they wouldn't talk about,
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.360]   and they don't want others to know about,
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   but because of that shame, they feel like damaged goods,
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   so they keep going after men and women who are not godly,
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.880]   who don't wanna have the type of marriage
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.420]   that you describe in Scripture,
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.740]   because they think it's the best they can do.
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.360]   I pray that you would pierce through that,
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.120]   that they would hear from the voice of you.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.920]   You're my child, you're my child.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.940]   You're forgiven.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.760]   That you would write an amazing story and profile
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.600]   and something beautiful.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.640]   I pray for everyone who's never trusted in your son
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.840]   for the payment for their sin,
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.520]   and death and resurrection, tonight would be their night.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.880]   Father, thank you that you love us
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.200]   despite everything messed up in my profile.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.500]   Everything in my past, everything in my present,
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.160]   everything where I need you, God,
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.680]   that I can rest and trust,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.600]   and accept and walk in your forgiveness.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.800]   I pray that this series,
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.220]   you would launch amazing relationships.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:41.460]   Men and women would start dating,
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.540]   they'd get married from it,
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.060]   and I pray that you also stop, destroy,
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.360]   and end relationships that they know right now
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.200]   they need to end.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.220]   Thank you that we have a relationship with you
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.780]   if we've by faith accepted it that never will end.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.860]   We worship you in song now, amen.
