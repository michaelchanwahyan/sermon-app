1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:13,000
 - Welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,640
 friends in Fort Worth, friends in Houston,

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,680
 and wherever you are tuning in with us

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,120
 as we continue this dating series

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,960
 as we kick off the fall and people are falling in love.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,080
 I'm gonna start with a story

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,400
 that'll give us some direction for where we're going.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,840
 About 10 years ago, 10 years ago, 10 years ago,

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,360
 I was working at a camp in Missouri

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,240
 and I was working for the director of the camp

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,400
 and he was a basically traveling evangelist

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,480
 and he would get asked to go speak all over the country

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,320
 at these different places.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,320
 And he was asked to go speak at a men's kind of rally event

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,720
 where they were gonna fill up

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,000
 the St. Louis Rams football stadium.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,560
 Kurt Warner was gonna be there

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,960
 and my friend was gonna speak at it

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,040
 and he said, "Hey, do you wanna come with me?"

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
 And I'm like, "Yeah, absolutely, this sounds awesome."

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,720
 And so we head up, get in the car,

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,840
 head out and head the direction of St. Louis,

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,640
 which was a few hours away, and we pull up to this airport.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,760
 And I'm like, "What are we doing here?"

26
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,240
 He says, "We're getting in the jet."

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
 They sent a jet that we're gonna get in and fly there.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,800
 And I'm like, "Oh my gosh, this is amazing.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,320
 "This is not normal for me.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,280
 "I didn't grow up in Highland Park."

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,120
 Just kidding.

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
 (congregation laughing)

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,960
 So we're, don't email if you're from Highland Park, I know.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,760
 Only like half have jets, I get it.

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,920
 So hey, we get in the, I know,

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,680
 that's gonna get even more emails, great.

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,800
 Okay, so we get in the jet, my friend is there,

38
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,080
 and this is a whole new experience,

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,840
 never had this before, you know, the leather seats.

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,680
 It's just, it's a little small jet, four seater.

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
 It's me and him and the pilot.

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,300
 And within like three minutes, he falls asleep.

43
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,460
 And he's just like knocked out.

44
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,440
 He's gonna take a nap on our way there.

45
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,680
 And so it's just me kind of with my thoughts and the pilot.

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,040
 And so I start talking to the pilot,

47
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,960
 "How long have you been flying?

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
 "You know, where are you from?"

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,120
 And eventually he just says,

50
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,480
 "Hey, do you wanna come up here to the cockpit?"

51
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,880
 "Yes, absolutely."

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,320
 So I'm riding shotgun in this jet.

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,040
 And I immediately realized something

54
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,720
 that I did not know about flying.

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,880
 You can't see where you're going.

56
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,560
 Like what I mean by that, in case you're like,

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,640
 "Oh yeah, it's kind of like driving a car,

58
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,920
 "you got the windshield up there."

59
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,840
 All you see, especially if there's heavy cloud cover,

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,280
 is total white.

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,600
 Like you don't see any, I could, for all we know,

62
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,120
 not even be off the ground right now.

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,320
 All that I see is smoke in front of us, or clouds,

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,280
 and we're driving or we're flying in the air

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,760
 at hundreds of miles an hour.

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,600
 And I'm like, "How do you see?

67
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,520
 "You can't see anything."

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,240
 And he says, "You don't trust what you see in front of you.

69
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,780
 "The way that you fly, whenever you're up in the clouds,

70
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,960
 "is you don't do it by kind of what you see

71
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,480
 "and how you feel.

72
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,040
 "You trust the instruments that you have within the plane."

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,120
 In other words, there's this thing,

74
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,960
 I was talking to actually a pilot shortly before this,

75
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,320
 who's on our staff, who used to be a pilot.

76
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,040
 And he said, "Yeah, there's something where,"

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,360
 and it's officially called black hole vertigo,

78
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,920
 black hole vertigo, where your senses will mess with you

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,960
 when you're up in the air, like fluid in your ears

80
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
 and a change in the weather around you,

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
 and you'll be flying a plane,

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,120
 and if you just trust how you feel,

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
 you'll be like, "Yeah, we're flying level,

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,340
 "and you're halfway turned this direction."

85
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,600
 You'll think that you're flying and you're just pulling up,

86
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 and if you just trust how it feels,

87
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,480
 you'll be literally turning over and about to flip.

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
 But if you just go off of what you feel

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,440
 and not trusting the instruments that you have there,

90
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,320
 then you are likely to head towards a crash

91
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,340
 in the midst of the clouds,

92
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,380
 if your head or when you're in the clouds,

93
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,640
 that you can't go off of what you feel or what you see.

94
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,760
 You have to trust the instruments.

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,480
 Can't go off of even your five senses.

96
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,000
 You have to trust the instruments,

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
 or you'll crash the plane.

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,320
 I mean, if you remember JFK Jr.,

99
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,240
 John F. Kennedy Jr., JFK's son,

100
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,680
 tragically was flying in 1999, if you remember that,

101
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,320
 and he was flying his own plane

102
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,440
 with his wife and his sister-in-law,

103
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,560
 and what he thought was headed towards

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,900
 just straight the destination

105
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,600
 was barreling towards the ocean,

106
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,180
 and he didn't make it.

107
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,680
 And all of them, without even calling a distress signal,

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,880
 thought, "We're totally fine,"

109
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,500
 and he's barreling towards the water

110
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,560
 and to his death, tragically.

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,440
 That just in flying a plane,

112
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,560
 you cannot trust what you see.

113
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,720
 You have to trust the instruments.

114
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,440
 Now, here's where I start there.

115
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,960
 Because as it relates to dating,

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,400
 there is a way in which all of us,

117
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,860
 if you're gonna experience success in dating,

118
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,740
 or if you don't want to crash and burn in dating,

119
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,660
 you cannot trust what you see,

120
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,600
 your senses, or your feelings.

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
 You have to trust the instruments

122
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
 that God has given us in his word.

123
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
 In other words, if you just go off of emotion,

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,160
 just like a plane, someone flying a plane,

125
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,120
 and they're like, "Yeah, I think I'm headed

126
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
 "in the right direction,"

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
 and you're halfway towards the ground

128
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
 and barreling towards disaster,

129
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,920
 if you just go off how you feel,

130
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,860
 you're going to crash and burn.

131
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,040
 That you and I are forced,

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 we must trust the instruments.

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,320
 By instruments, I mean the principles

134
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,540
 or the truths that God has given us

135
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,240
 inside of his word, as it relates to dating.

136
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
 Because whenever you're in love

137
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
 or you're in like, strong like,

138
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,040
 your head is in the clouds.

139
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,920
 You can't see the fog around you.

140
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,960
 You're like, "It's amazing,"

141
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,880
 and you don't even know that you're barrel rolling.

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,000
 I mean, everywhere you go,

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,840
 you just have soft music in the background

144
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,360
 and you're running in a field

145
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,920
 towards them in slow motion.

146
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,160
 And you are trusting your feelings.

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,520
 And if you and I are not careful,

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,500
 where the only thing that we trust is our feelings,

149
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
 we are going to crash and burn.

150
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
 So tonight, we're gonna talk,

151
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,240
 if you take notes, we're talking about

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 trusting the instruments that God has given us for dating.

153
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,020
 Because the Bible, unfortunately,

154
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,260
 the bad news is, doesn't talk a lot about dating.

155
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,400
 Actually, it doesn't talk at all about dating.

156
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,480
 But it does have a lot to say about marriage,

157
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,480
 about sex, about love, and all the in-between stages.

158
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
 So tonight, we're gonna look at five things

159
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,320
 from God's word as it relates to trusting.

160
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,520
 These are the instruments that if you're

161
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,700
 in a serious dating relationship,

162
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,000
 if you're in any relationship,

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,840
 if you ever wanna be in a relationship,

164
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,160
 these five things are crucial components

165
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,840
 for you to not neglect and for all of us to trust

166
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,940
 to avoid crashing and burning as it relates to marriage.

167
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,100
 So we're gonna be really going through these five things

168
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,340
 as we continue this series on First Comes Love.

169
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,100
 And we're gonna dive right in.

170
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,780
 And here's the first one, is it comes from God's word.

171
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,180
 That as it relates to dating,

172
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,260
 when you begin to navigate one of the first instruments

173
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,060
 that you need to make sure that you're evaluating

174
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,900
 the relationship and, you know, am I in like,

175
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,380
 am I in love, where am I right now?

176
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,500
 Is that you make sure that when you look for

177
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,880
 a potential spouse, that you are looking

178
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,700
 for character, not curves.

179
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,580
 You are looking for character, not curves.

180
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,500
 You could say it another way.

181
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,360
 You are looking for character, not characteristics.

182
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
 That you are physical characteristics.

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
 That when it comes to, hey, I'm gonna prioritize.

184
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,040
 And I think everyone in the room's like,

185
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,000
 yeah, I want character, but gosh, she is hot.

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,720
 And so you have to make sure that you don't follow

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,200
 your feelings and that you are true to trusting the man

188
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,120
 when it comes to the priority of the person

189
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,740
 that I'm gonna marry, a person that I'm gonna date.

190
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,400
 Character above everything else.

191
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,680
 Not an amazing body or a huge bank account,

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,780
 but character, because if both of those things can fade

193
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,080
 or be gone in an instant.

194
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,320
 That Proverbs 31, or this proverb that we're given,

195
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,120
 and if you have time this week, go read it.

196
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
 It's an amazing proverb.

197
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
 It's written from a mother to her son.

198
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,220
 And she writes this proverb, she's like,

199
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,220
 baby boy, I'm about to tell you who you need to date,

200
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,120
 who you need to marry, and here's who I want you to look for.

201
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,240
 And inside of the proverb, all these amazing things

202
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,640
 are said, but she specifically says a couple things

203
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,120
 about character, here's one of them,

204
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,760
 that she says to her son,

205
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,320
 a wife of noble character, who can find?

206
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,240
 She is worth far more than rubies.

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,880
 Like in other words, hey, let me tell you,

208
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,360
 at the top of the list of things to value,

209
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,660
 is not a great hairdo and not a great external appearance,

210
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,920
 not that they're an amazing athlete,

211
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,040
 but is someone of incredible character.

212
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,960
 Then she says this, that son, charm,

213
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,640
 or like a winsomeness, and they're smooth and attractive,

214
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,760
 is deceptive, it can be deceiving.

215
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,080
 Like don't let it fool you,

216
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
 don't let that be the single thing,

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,700
 that you're smooth and they're flirty.

218
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,300
 And beauty is fleeting, it's going away,

219
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,500
 that it won't be here, that regardless

220
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,040
 of how hot they look right now,

221
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,220
 gravity wins that game on everybody.

222
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,780
 (congregation laughing)

223
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,020
 And so don't be deceived, and don't buy in

224
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,420
 or put your stock in the wrong things,

225
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,780
 but a woman who fears the Lord is worthy to be praised.

226
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,180
 All throughout the proverb, I mean go read it,

227
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,260
 he says, look, son, don't just look

228
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,100
 for someone who's gonna make a hot wife

229
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,520
 and have a great 20s Instagram profile,

230
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,660
 but look for someone who's gonna be an amazing grandma,

231
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,860
 an amazing mother, or an amazing husband,

232
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,420
 an amazing father, an amazing grandfather,

233
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,500
 someone to grow old and both get ugly together with.

234
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 Look for someone who has character, not curves.

235
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,460
 That having a beautiful wife does not mean

236
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,220
 having a beautiful life, and the same is true

237
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,180
 with a husband, having a handsome or wealthy husband,

238
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,660
 gosh, I hope you get this, does not equate

239
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,620
 to having a beautiful life, and this mother

240
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,300
 speaks to her son who's a prince, and says,

241
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,140
 look, you can have any girl you want.

242
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,420
 Don't be fooled by girls who are always so pretty,

243
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,520
 but they don't have character.

244
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,500
 The second idea that we see from the text,

245
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,340
 or I mean, before we go there, in my notes I just wrote,

246
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,980
 I mean, it didn't take long to look at Hollywood,

247
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,100
 and it's clear to see that, man, what matters most

248
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
 in a person's life for their level of satisfaction

249
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,460
 or just kind of the level of marital satisfaction

250
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,900
 that I think most of us would want.

251
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,500
 Nobody's like, you know what my goal is?

252
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,860
 Divorce, depressed, those are the things

253
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
 that I'm looking for in life.

254
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,260
 I think all of us would be like, man,

255
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
 I'd love to be in a relationship defined

256
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,780
 by someone who loves me, is there to have and hold,

257
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,180
 for richer, for poorer, sickness and health, they're there.

258
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,020
 And what allows a marriage to be successful

259
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,500
 is character, not physical characteristics.

260
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,840
 You can see it everywhere you look in Hollywood.

261
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,500
 I mean, how many more People Magazine

262
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,700
 or whatever magazine articles are gonna come out

263
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
 about Brad and Angelina, they're apart, they're together,

264
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,980
 they're married, they're not.

265
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,620
 I mean, how many things are relationships,

266
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,300
 does it take for us to see that, man,

267
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,540
 you can have a beautiful wife

268
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,040
 and not have a beautiful life.

269
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,180
 And King Lemuel's mother says,

270
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,340
 "Look for character over curves."

271
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,660
 Looks can be deceiving.

272
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,100
 What matters most is on the inside.

273
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
 This past week, or this past weekend,

274
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,940
 our son has been sick for the last little bit,

275
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,860
 I'll talk about that in a second,

276
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,420
 and so we've got little kids Motrin,

277
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,940
 liquid Motrin, all over the place,

278
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,260
 like all over the house, and I'm cooking dinner.

279
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,460
 We got this thing called Blue Apron,

280
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,980
 it's like a meal, it comes in the mail,

281
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,740
 and they're mailing us our food.

282
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,580
 And I got the food, I'm cooking it.

283
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,500
 We had just a crazy last 10 days,

284
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,620
 so I was like, "Hey, wife, Callie,

285
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,560
 "I want you to go get a foot massage,

286
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,780
 "which is like half the price of a real massage,

287
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,460
 "but we can do it 'cause it's only like 25 bucks,

288
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,860
 "so go get a foot massage, I'm gonna make dinner,

289
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,700
 "it's gonna be awesome."

290
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,660
 Blue Apron, pull it out, begin to cook the meal.

291
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,860
 Baby's over there watching cartoon,

292
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,940
 trying to cook the meal, trying to keep things from burning,

293
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,140
 and I'm making all the food,

294
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,740
 and I'm just not a great cook,

295
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,900
 so things get burned and things get messed up quickly.

296
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,740
 So I'm following the ingredients, so I think,

297
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,660
 and there's this little bottle of vinegar,

298
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,180
 and it's over, and it's supposed to go

299
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,100
 on kind of the vegetables and kind of poured on everything,

300
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,940
 it's gonna be great.

301
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,700
 And I'm cooking the food, and I'm watching,

302
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
 "Are you still breathing in there, little child?"

303
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,420
 And, [laughs] his name's Crew, I call him little child.

304
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,900
 And, [laughs] who am I, what kind of dad does that?

305
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,580
 Anyways, so I'm cooking, and I reach over for the bottle,

306
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,100
 and I take it, and it looks strikingly similar

307
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,060
 to the liquid Motrin that is right next to it.

308
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,300
 Take it out, take it over, "You okay in there?"

309
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,660
 Dunk, and the entire bottle of liquid Motrin

310
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,480
 goes over all of the food.

311
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,540
 And it's like, "Well, all right, pizza night, it is."

312
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,260
 [audience laughs]

313
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,740
 Because looks can be deceiving.

314
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,580
 [audience laughs]

315
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,780
 Don't clap for bad cooking, but here's why that matters.

316
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,700
 In the same way that on the outside,

317
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,660
 they were strikingly similar, like blue apron,

318
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,940
 please, can we change this?

319
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,920
 And what mattered most, though,

320
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,100
 was what was on the inside.

321
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,140
 That's not just pithy, it's not just,

322
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,460
 oh, that's kinda cute and funny, it is the truth.

323
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,460
 And your marriage will be made or broken on the character,

324
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,600
 on what's inside of those who are a part of it.

325
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,100
 The second idea that we're gonna pull

326
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,420
 from really the second instrument to trust

327
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,900
 goes along with this idea of character,

328
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,260
 and who to look for, and what to make sure

329
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,200
 is a component of their life is to make sure

330
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,680
 the person that you're dating loves Jesus.

331
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
 I don't mean like, hey, they say, "I'm a Christian,"

332
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
 they go to church, they went on a mission trip one time,

333
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,380
 they go with their family at Easter, and they seem nice.

334
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,840
 I mean, they love Jesus.

335
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,640
 They are all in with him.

336
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,000
 They know where true life is found,

337
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,680
 they wanna follow him, they love him

338
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,920
 more than they'll ever love you.

339
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,320
 This is the type of person to date,

340
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,140
 and to consider, or as the relationship develops and moves,

341
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,340
 to move towards marriage with,

342
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,460
 make sure that they love Jesus.

343
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,660
 Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6, 14,

344
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,660
 "Do not be yoked or bound together with unbelievers,

345
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,720
 "someone who doesn't share the same faith,

346
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,740
 "someone who's not in love with Jesus,

347
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,900
 "someone who may be a cultural Christian.

348
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,940
 "For what does righteousness and wickedness have in common,

349
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,480
 "or what fellowship can light have with darkness,

350
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
 "that makes sure above everything else

351
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,900
 "that they love Jesus, how do you know?"

352
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,340
 Really, if you can't tell, they don't.

353
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,500
 Like, if you're like, I don't know

354
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,220
 if this is a priority in his life,

355
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,820
 I mean, maybe I should just ask,

356
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,900
 hey, do you love Jesus?

357
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
 Usually speaking, and that may be like,

358
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,420
 maybe there's some exception up there,

359
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,080
 so for the most part, you'll see it.

360
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,260
 It comes out in how they spend their time,

361
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,800
 how they think about their money,

362
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,620
 how they use their words,

363
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,020
 where they invest their weekends,

364
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,360
 the friends and the company that they keep.

365
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,380
 Make sure that you're dating someone who loves Jesus.

366
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,640
 And if not, you need a breakup,

367
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,740
 and you need to tonight, like before you leave.

368
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,960
 And spare yourself the heartache and heartbreak

369
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,840
 that's gonna happen and come into your life

370
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,560
 by you dating someone or moving towards marriage

371
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,880
 with someone who is heading in a different destination,

372
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,500
 in a different direction than you're headed.

373
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,560
 Last week, because we moved kind of a couple weeks ago,

374
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,400
 JP and I were gonna meet at my new house.

375
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,720
 So we were coming from two different places.

376
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
 Hey, I'll meet you at my house.

377
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,480
 And as we headed there, I sent him the new address

378
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,600
 that we're at, and he typed it into his phone,

379
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,860
 I typed it into mine, and we're headed off.

380
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,120
 And I get to the house, and I'm like, where are you?

381
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,200
 And he said, I'm about to turn on your street,

382
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,500
 and I said, what cross streets are you at?

383
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,280
 And he begins to describe the cross streets,

384
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,360
 and they're way over in the other side of town.

385
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,040
 I'm like, you're not about to turn onto my street.

386
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,240
 Well, according to the Waze app, I am.

387
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,240
 And what had happened was that the zip code

388
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,160
 was a different one, but the same street name,

389
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,700
 it's just in a zip code that was entirely different,

390
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,020
 and that he had headed towards a very different direction

391
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,000
 and destination than I had headed towards

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,400
 without even realizing it,

393
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,940
 thinking maybe we're headed in the same direction.

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,180
 And what the Bible says, just the fact of the matter is,

395
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,020
 if you are dating someone who's not a believer,

396
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,800
 you're headed in different destinations,

397
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,120
 different eternal destinations,

398
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,840
 different destinations in this life.

399
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,860
 How can I make it more clear?

400
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,720
 You're headed towards heaven,

401
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,320
 and they're headed towards hell.

402
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,520
 It's impossible to maintain a strong relationship

403
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,360
 if Jesus is the main thing in your life,

404
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,760
 and if it's not the main thing in their life.

405
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,160
 You're headed towards heartbreak.

406
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,040
 There's no way of getting around it.

407
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,000
 And if you're dating someone who's not a believer,

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,160
 or who would just say, you know, it's kind of a,

409
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,200
 yeah, I'm just, I don't take my faith too seriously,

410
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,960
 you need to get out now.

411
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,460
 If you're not a believer,

412
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,560
 man, the most significant thing that you can do

413
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,960
 is not learn any of these dating suggestions,

414
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,040
 or really truths from the Bible.

415
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,560
 It's not focused on any of them,

416
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
 but you need to meet Jesus.

417
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,160
 You're never gonna be able to get it right with your mate

418
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,780
 until you first are right with your maker.

419
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,360
 And it's impossible for you to enter into a marriage,

420
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,200
 and hey, I'm gonna get it right,

421
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,160
 and it's gonna be awesome,

422
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,960
 if you have not first got made right with Jesus,

423
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,920
 or with your maker, and your creator.

424
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,080
 So here we go, so we got,

425
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,340
 make sure you value character over curves,

426
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,720
 or physical characteristics.

427
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,760
 Make sure that the person that you're dating

428
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,240
 loves Jesus above everything else.

429
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,080
 And then number three,

430
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,840
 make sure that Christ followers support the relationships.

431
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,680
 In other words, don't follow your feelings,

432
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
 don't follow where you think you are,

433
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,300
 'cause the plane may be tipping.

434
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,920
 Make sure that you follow the instruments.

435
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,120
 And the third thing that God tells us from his word

436
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,360
 that's crucial for success to happen

437
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,600
 in any sort of planned out,

438
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,240
 or any sort of hopeful future,

439
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,040
 is that other people who love and know Jesus,

440
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,280
 or who walk with God need to be involved.

441
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,480
 Make sure, if you wanna experience success in dating,

442
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,680
 not crash the plane,

443
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,820
 that you have other Christ followers inside of your life

444
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,520
 who support the relationship.

445
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
 Not like your random frat buddies from college

446
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,040
 who are like, yeah dude, she's cool, man.

447
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,340
 But Christ followers, your community group,

448
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,140
 people in your family, your small group,

449
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,340
 or people in your family who know Jesus and love him,

450
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,460
 they support the relationship.

451
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,300
 And man, this is huge,

452
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,160
 'cause I can hear people in the room being like, no.

453
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,780
 I mean, they're not supportive because they're jealous.

454
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,800
 They're all against us.

455
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,420
 The world's against, it's a big conspiracy.

456
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,940
 You guys are not star-crossed lovers

457
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,180
 destined to be together.

458
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,380
 If people in your life are saying,

459
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,300
 I don't think he's good for you,

460
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,740
 I don't think she's the person

461
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,780
 that you need to be dating right now,

462
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,540
 you should have serious concern,

463
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,800
 especially if they're people who know Jesus

464
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,140
 and love you and love him.

465
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,820
 What are the people, if you're dating someone,

466
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,120
 what are the people in your life,

467
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,160
 what are the people who are closest to you,

468
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,920
 who are also closely seeking to walk with God,

469
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,020
 or with Jesus, say,

470
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,920
 what would they say about the relationship?

471
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,480
 Song of Solomon chapter one, verse four,

472
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,560
 talks about this couple who is moving towards marriage,

473
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,500
 and it says their friends looked on

474
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,220
 and they praised their relationship.

475
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,500
 They praised their relationship.

476
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,780
 Proverbs 15, 22 says that plans fail for a lack of counsel,

477
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,480
 but with many advisors, they succeed.

478
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,740
 Is the person that you're dating in community,

479
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,640
 is the person that you're dating,

480
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,660
 someone who has other people in their life

481
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,320
 that makes them kind of a known commodity,

482
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,060
 it's not some guy who just mysteriously shows up,

483
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,860
 is someone, or is he someone or she someone who's known,

484
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,340
 walking in the light with other people?

485
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,260
 And do you know the ways that God is just still at work?

486
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,940
 'Cause we're all imperfect people, all a work in progress.

487
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,100
 Do you know the ways that God's still at work in his heart,

488
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,780
 or in her heart, the person that you're dating?

489
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,220
 Like, do you know that, yeah, hey, Mr. Right turns into

490
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,020
 Mr. Hulk whenever he doesn't get his way,

491
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,800
 or Mrs. Right and Mrs. Sweet turns into Mrs. Cha-ching Spend

492
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,180
 when she gets stressed out?

493
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,180
 Are you aware, and are others aware,

494
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,740
 of just the ways that God is at work in her life?

495
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,460
 You do not have to have perfection,

496
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,980
 but having the collection of God's people around

497
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,780
 will protect you and protect them.

498
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,600
 Is the person that you're dating someone

499
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,980
 who's a known commodity?

500
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,920
 Do other Christ followers support the relationship?

501
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,760
 Number four.

502
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
 Number four, the fourth instrument,

503
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,580
 as it relates to making sure you don't trust your feelings.

504
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,580
 The fourth action is to preserve purity,

505
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,040
 preserve purity, preserve purity in the relationship.

506
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,480
 If you're dating someone,

507
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,000
 that you make sure that you don't introduce sex,

508
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,680
 the Bible says, "Awaken love before it's time."

509
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 Hebrews 13, verse four says that the marriage bed

510
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,040
 should be kept pure and marriage honored by everyone.

511
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,880
 First Corinthians six says, "Flee sexual immorality."

512
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,940
 Every other sin that you commit is different from this one

513
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,780
 because the person who commits sexual sin

514
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,540
 sins against themselves.

515
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,380
 Flee it.

516
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,200
 You're gonna hurt yourself,

517
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,380
 you're gonna hurt your dating relationship.

518
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,780
 Preserve purity, the Bible says.

519
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,000
 And I think that one of the reasons this is so crucial

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,620
 is like we said already, like, dude, love is intoxicating.

521
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,860
 Like if you're in love, it's amazing.

522
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,940
 You're like, I love love.

523
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,660
 There's flowers everywhere, I can see 'em.

524
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,540
 It's just, I just feel incredible.

525
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,800
 And when you introduce sex

526
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,560
 to this already kind of intoxicated, it's amazing.

527
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,920
 You are playing with fire.

528
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,040
 You are putting on blinders.

529
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,520
 It's gonna keep you in a relationship

530
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,880
 longer than you ever should have been in.

531
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,980
 It's gonna blind you to things that you'll look over

532
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,980
 'cause you're like, man, just, this is, sex is amazing.

533
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,680
 Sure, we fight all the time, but when we touch,

534
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,640
 it's like electricity just between us.

535
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,160
 And it's gonna keep you from experiencing

536
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,960
 the type of dating relationship and future marriage

537
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,280
 that God wants you to have.

538
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,420
 I think what's happened as a society,

539
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,260
 and this is so crazy, and most of you won't believe me,

540
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,260
 but we've moved so far from God's design

541
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,440
 as it relates to sex.

542
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,660
 Like this incredible gift that he gave

543
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,060
 for the purpose of a man and a woman

544
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,780
 coming together in marriage, this one context.

545
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,820
 Like in other words, that feels like archaic and old school.

546
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,940
 God's design is that sex would be given

547
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,620
 for a very specific place, marriage,

548
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,540
 between one man and one woman who would come together

549
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,920
 and this incredibly pleasurable thing

550
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,640
 would be this incredibly powerful bonding agent

551
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,120
 and would unite them together.

552
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,120
 And that they would experience just nakedness

553
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,220
 and unashamedness together.

554
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,100
 And we live in a culture that has looked at sex

555
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,040
 and it's like so, it basically has been boiled down

556
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,800
 that, man, sex is just physical.

557
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,000
 It's like no different than kissing.

558
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,480
 It's not that big of a deal.

559
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,180
 And the hookup culture and Tinder has totally

560
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,040
 made this even worse.

561
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,240
 And this incredibly sacred almost gift that God gave

562
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
 because God, here's the truth.

563
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,740
 God wants you to have an amazing sex life.

564
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,560
 Like unbelievably, crazy banging,

565
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,360
 it's amazing, off the chain.

566
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,340
 That's what God wants for you.

567
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,640
 He made sex, he created it.

568
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,200
 And you hear people be like, man,

569
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,300
 you just gotta stay away from sex, drugs, and rock and roll

570
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,400
 'cause that's all the devil.

571
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,280
 God's like, I invented sex.

572
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,880
 You can't take that one, that's mine.

573
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,160
 I'm the one who gave it to man.

574
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,400
 I want them to have amazing sex.

575
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,640
 But them devaluing it and thinking it's like,

576
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,040
 it's not that big of a deal, you can do it.

577
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,280
 It's just so commonplace, makes it impossible

578
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,520
 for them to experience that.

579
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,800
 It's all against the design.

580
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,840
 It's not dissimilar to pineapples.

581
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,220
 And here's what I mean.

582
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,800
 Left turn.

583
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:41,200
 In the 1500s, Christopher Columbus shows up, 1492,

584
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,720
 and he shows up, and I realize it's the 1400s.

585
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,480
 And then he goes back to the New World,

586
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,280
 and all of a sudden, this new world is introduced.

587
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,000
 Inside of the new world, something was seen

588
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,600
 for the very first time, pineapple.

589
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,800
 They took it back, this fruit.

590
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,960
 Christopher Columbus shows up, shows up back in Europe,

591
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,680
 and he goes, dude, look at this thing, this is awesome.

592
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,160
 And they go, what is that?

593
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
 And he said, it looks like a pine cone,

594
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,880
 tastes like an apple, pineapple.

595
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,400
 And they named it the pineapple.

596
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,560
 Here's what was unique about pineapples.

597
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,000
 They became what is known, you can go look it up today,

598
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,280
 the very first luxury item from the New World.

599
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,400
 No one had ever seen anything like this before.

600
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,200
 It was so exclusive, so exotic, so unique.

601
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,960
 It was only for the elite of the elite.

602
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,220
 Like, it was something that you couldn't,

603
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,200
 most people couldn't afford.

604
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,340
 At the rate that it was going for,

605
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,120
 if you adjust for inflation,

606
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,440
 historians say it sold for $8,000 a pineapple.

607
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
 Think about that, eight grand.

608
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,840
 Most people would never eat one, would never touch one.

609
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,060
 You wouldn't oftentimes eat them if you bought them.

610
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,880
 You would keep it in your house and just be like,

611
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,480
 dude, look at this, look at this.

612
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
 (congregation laughing)

613
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,820
 Mom, I made it, see the pineapple?

614
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,840
 I mean, if you go, even if you go

615
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,320
 to St. Paul's Cathedral in London,

616
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,920
 why is there a giant pineapple on the cathedral?

617
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,520
 Because it was this symbol of success and luxury

618
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,860
 and just this incredibly exotic, amazing thing.

619
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,040
 Pineapples today sell for like $1.99.

620
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,640
 The invention of kind of the pineapple plantations

621
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,560
 and the spread of farming and different technological

622
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,840
 advances has made it to where pineapples,

623
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,160
 there's nothing special about pineapples.

624
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,800
 You weren't like, oh my gosh, pineapples, that's incredible.

625
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,980
 I saw him, he had a pineapple, he must be successful.

626
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,320
 That doesn't mean any of that to you.

627
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,520
 (congregation laughing)

628
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,240
 Because they've become so common

629
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,560
 that when we look at them, it's nothing special.

630
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,240
 What changed about pineapple?

631
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,320
 Nothing.

632
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,940
 Just the perception of the world around it did.

633
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,200
 And in the same way, it's such a perfect analogy

634
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,680
 for what has happened to sex.

635
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,320
 This incredibly just thing that God gave

636
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
 to be this one exclusive relationship

637
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,920
 between one man and one woman that would come together

638
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,160
 without guilt and shame from past relationships,

639
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,420
 without worrying about, man, am I gonna be compared

640
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,000
 to her other boyfriends in the past,

641
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,920
 without worrying about like, I hope I have a condom

642
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,760
 'cause I may get an STD, without worrying

643
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 about any of those things,

644
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,200
 this incredibly incredible gift

645
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,240
 that God gave for this one context

646
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,700
 between one man and one woman has become common,

647
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,760
 not that big of a deal, and what changed?

648
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,360
 The perception of it.

649
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,640
 And we live in a culture that is so devalued.

650
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,660
 And in doing so, devaluing sex has so made it so difficult

651
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,080
 to experience this incredible gift

652
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,840
 the way that God designed it to work.

653
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,800
 One of the best things you can do if you're dating someone,

654
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,740
 preserve purity, preserve purity.

655
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,680
 And regardless of your past, you can be a part

656
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,080
 of changing your present and changing the future,

657
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,840
 saying, I'm gonna preserve purity in this relationship,

658
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,740
 moving forward, and let God continue to heal.

659
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,200
 And you may be thinking, and this,

660
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,320
 oh, every time we say this, it like gets pushed back,

661
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
 which is so interesting to me, is people will say,

662
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,120
 well, how do we know if we're sexually compatible then?

663
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,900
 If you're a man and she's a woman,

664
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,680
 you know that you're sexually compatible.

665
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,180
 I mean, that's insane.

666
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,360
 And if that's where you're feeling like,

667
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
 no, man, we may not be,

668
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,900
 I don't even wanna get into parts here,

669
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,420
 but if you revisit health class from seventh grade,

670
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,720
 you're gonna know who's sexually compatible with who.

671
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,820
 You don't have to wonder the question of what if we're not,

672
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,840
 what if we don't enjoy it, and what if we don't?

673
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,320
 No, if you step into sex, you are going

674
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,240
 to create what sex always does,

675
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,360
 scars and baggage that you're gonna have,

676
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,720
 that's not impossible, that Chris can't come in

677
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,960
 and he can bring healing to,

678
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
 but it's gonna bring about scars and pain

679
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,160
 that God doesn't want for you to experience.

680
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,120
 To the response of like people go,

681
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
 man, well, then how are you gonna know

682
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,680
 if you're gonna have great sex?

683
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,720
 You may not.

684
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,960
 But the good news is you got a lifetime.

685
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,360
 When my wife and I, we've been married five years,

686
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,200
 when we first got married,

687
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,600
 like we both entered into the marriage,

688
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,180
 we had not had sex before.

689
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,240
 And we got into the relationship and it wasn't like,

690
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,280
 dude, this is crazy, unbelievable, oh my gosh.

691
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,600
 It was still, sex is amazing, it's unbelievable,

692
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,400
 best part of your day every time it happens.

693
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,720
 But, (congregation laughing)

694
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,560
 but it wasn't like, man, this is just,

695
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,240
 we're gonna write the book after this.

696
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,760
 It was like, man, hey, we're trying to,

697
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,220
 just because both of us had not had practice.

698
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,880
 But you know, we got a lifetime to have,

699
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,240
 practice makes perfect, but if you practice before

700
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,740
 you enter that lifetime, practice makes permanent.

701
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,120
 And the God who loves you says,

702
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,680
 man, wherever you are in your journey,

703
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,560
 today you can begin to pursue and preserve purity.

704
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,800
 Inside of that, number five, and our final one

705
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,800
 from this instrument idea of trusting not how you feel,

706
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,160
 but trusting the instruments, the principles

707
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,440
 that God has given us in his word,

708
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,720
 is today to become the person,

709
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,620
 the person you're looking for is looking for.

710
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,600
 To spend today becoming the one

711
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,320
 that the one that you're looking for out there

712
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,160
 is looking for.

713
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,980
 I know that sounds like, what, is that Inception?

714
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,000
 What did he just say?

715
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,720
 Become, here's what I mean.

716
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,080
 This comes from a guy named Andy Stanley

717
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,880
 who wrote a book on this topic itself.

718
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,000
 And today, one of the most practical things you can do

719
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,920
 is not avoid trying to marry the wrong person,

720
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,440
 but spend today becoming the right person.

721
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,080
 Focus on becoming the person that the person

722
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,720
 who you want to marry is going to want to marry.

723
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
 Like in other words, whatever you,

724
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,120
 as you think through, like man, you know,

725
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,480
 Sally's out there and this, or whatever her name will be,

726
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,680
 and she, I hope, is gonna love Jesus.

727
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,080
 She's gonna be, you know, all this other list of things

728
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
 that we add on of she's a supermodel

729
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,480
 and she's got, you know, an amazing,

730
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,360
 she's amazing at sex, but she's a virgin

731
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
 and she loves to cook and she does all this whole list.

732
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,740
 But whatever that list is,

733
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,380
 usually for people who love Jesus,

734
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,720
 it's like, and she's radically in love with Jesus.

735
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,520
 That if you want to marry that person,

736
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,240
 you gotta spend today becoming the person

737
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,040
 that someone who's in love with Jesus

738
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
 is going to want to marry.

739
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,280
 Because the truth is, tragically,

740
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,740
 supermodel Sally, she wouldn't wanna marry you.

741
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,140
 Many of you.

742
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,300
 And it's not because she's like, I don't like,

743
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,780
 you know, he's overweight

744
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,040
 or he doesn't have great teeth or whatever.

745
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,140
 It's because they're not someone who looks at you

746
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,580
 and goes, man, they are madly in love with Jesus.

747
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,100
 And the best thing you can do today is to spend it

748
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,120
 focused on being the one that the someone

749
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,860
 that you're looking for is looking for.

750
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,300
 How do you do that?

751
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,020
 You use this season really, really well.

752
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,780
 You live in community with other people

753
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,700
 of the same gender, same sex that are in your life

754
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
 that hold you accountable.

755
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,800
 Speak into your life.

756
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,960
 You do it by dealing with addictions right now.

757
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,860
 Whether it's pornography,

758
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,940
 which won't go away when you get married,

759
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,860
 it will get worse.

760
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,960
 And now you'll have someone else involved.

761
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,300
 Maybe it's an addiction to alcohol.

762
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,580
 Maybe it's an addiction to spending.

763
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,460
 And maybe the most incredible gift you can give

764
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,260
 to your spouse would be for you to begin to go to regen.

765
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,860
 And you haven't even met your spouse.

766
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,660
 Like you don't even know who they are.

767
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,780
 They're not even on your radar,

768
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,180
 but you can invest and say, man,

769
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,340
 I'm gonna give this season to get healthy.

770
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,300
 I'm gonna use the season well.

771
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,060
 I'm gonna become the person,

772
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,300
 the person I'm looking for is gonna be looking for.

773
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,580
 Others of you, you're gonna have to step into community

774
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,220
 and change playmates and change your playgrounds.

775
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,180
 You may have to do,

776
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,220
 just have follow-up conversations with people

777
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,260
 who you're holding bitterness against.

778
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,660
 In a way that I'm sure if we heard your story,

779
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,580
 we'd understand, but you're just holding, it's a parent.

780
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,140
 It's someone who passed, in your past, abused

781
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,100
 or just wherever someone has come in and hurt you

782
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,940
 and you just need to work through the process of forgiving

783
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,020
 so that you're not holding onto that bitterness.

784
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,220
 Some of you may need to just do everything you can

785
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,900
 to get out of debt so that you're not coming

786
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,700
 to this relationship going, man,

787
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,900
 I hope you're gonna be able to pay this off.

788
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,460
 But use the season well, become the person

789
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,380
 that the person you're looking for is looking for.

790
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,660
 I heard it said this week that the people

791
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,660
 who have the best I do's are the ones who is singles,

792
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,340
 spin it saying, I don't.

793
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,500
 The people who have the best I do someday

794
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,340
 are the ones who two day spin it saying, I don't.

795
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,460
 I'm not gonna date that, I'm not gonna go there,

796
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,220
 I'm not gonna spend my weekend at that club again.

797
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,020
 I'm not gonna continue to smoke pot and be like,

798
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,240
 someday I'll grow out of this.

799
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,540
 The people who have the best I do someday

800
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,980
 are the ones who strive to say, I don't, two day.

801
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,840
 Let me close with this.

802
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:16,020
 We just had like the craziest like last few weeks.

803
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,580
 I feel like I'm like beating a gong

804
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,860
 and like we've been sleeping on a mattress

805
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,300
 in the floor for six weeks,

806
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,820
 on the floor for six weeks kind of thing.

807
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,980
 Like we're like in this house that we just moved into

808
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,900
 that they're remodeling.

809
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,780
 We have a fridge in our living room, people.

810
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,060
 How crazy is that?

811
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,460
 And like, it's just like total chaos,

812
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,500
 sleeping on a mattress.

813
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,660
 It's been so hectic and so crazy.

814
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,140
 And we had launch retreat, which was amazing

815
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,340
 and this incredible weekend.

816
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,500
 And last week, it's the hecticness was still kind of going on

817
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,780
 and we had this weekend.

818
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,500
 Last week we were like, man, the weekend's gonna come.

819
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,320
 It's gonna be awesome.

820
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,220
 The weekend finally came and our son gets a fever,

821
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,380
 103.8 fever.

822
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,300
 And we're like, we gotta go to the doctor.

823
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,160
 We go to the doctor and he tested positive for pneumonia.

824
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,020
 It's like, oh my gosh, man, it's like hurricane.

825
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,020
 And in all this chaos of life and just the stress

826
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,020
 of kind of the home environment being so chaotic

827
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,340
 and construction people in there all the time

828
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,820
 and sleeping on a mattress and now he's got pneumonia.

829
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,420
 And the kind of pneumonia where you're,

830
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,500
 I mean, I guess any pneumonia,

831
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,180
 but where you're up every three hours

832
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,780
 giving a medicine kind of thing.

833
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,500
 And in the midst of that, my wife, whose name is Callie,

834
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,880
 was such a champ.

835
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,340
 Like by far the most godly person in our family is my wife.

836
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,860
 And she's up every three hours.

837
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,700
 She's nurturing, she's caring.

838
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,540
 It's this like mama bear instinct turns on for mothers.

839
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,380
 And in the midst of all of that, she's not complaining.

840
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:53,020
 She's praying over him, she's singing over him,

841
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,260
 and she's caring for him.

842
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:00,180
 Every week and for the last eight years,

843
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,140
 there are lots and lots of beautiful women

844
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,540
 that are a part of the porch.

845
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,460
 Really, really attractive, pretty.

846
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,300
 And I've seen it so many times personally

847
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,180
 and in marriages that end up taking place

848
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,980
 where someone will marry someone that's man, smoking hot,

849
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,060
 but they don't have character.

850
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,300
 And what happens in moments like that?

851
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,740
 I mean, that's what life is like.

852
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,700
 I hope you're not thinking like, man,

853
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,260
 it's just gonna be this honeymoon and it's amazing.

854
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,860
 And all we're doing is either having a romp fest

855
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,340
 or watching rom-coms together.

856
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,760
 That's not what life is.

857
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,900
 Life just brings this chaos around.

858
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,060
 And if you don't have character,

859
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,020
 regardless of how smoking hot they are, it will not last.

860
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,300
 And they're not someone that you wanna

861
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,380
 walk through life with.

862
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,140
 The truth for you and for me and for everybody

863
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,540
 is you don't need a guy on your arm

864
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,300
 who's just hunk and strong jawline.

865
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,700
 You need a girl who stands there and wears the right dress.

866
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,780
 You need someone to go to war with 'cause life is a war.

867
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,580
 And you're gonna face it every single day.

868
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,040
 Who are you going to marry?

869
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,380
 If you really prioritize, man,

870
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,220
 I just wanna have someone with a huge bustline

871
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,860
 and not to have character or not have a relationship

872
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,420
 with Jesus that anchors them in the midst of chaos.

873
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,020
 Who are you gonna trust in?

874
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,780
 Are you gonna trust in the feelings that you have?

875
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,780
 And if you do, you're gonna crash the plane,

876
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,060
 tragically, more tragic or as tragic

877
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,280
 as JFK Jr. driving into the water himself.

878
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,380
 Who are you gonna trust in?

879
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,660
 Your feelings?

880
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,100
 That really you guys are the one couple

881
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,200
 in the whole universe that really is gonna break the rules

882
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,620
 that God has set up in his word?

883
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,220
 That, oh, no, not us, we got a song,

884
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,820
 we got everything going together, we're gonna be great,

885
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,580
 we're gonna be just fine, it's us against the world.

886
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,100
 It won't work.

887
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,380
 And God has given principles clearly in scripture

888
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,900
 that if you were dating someone and you're saying,

889
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,580
 man, they don't have that great a character,

890
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,180
 but he's a trust fund baby, you're gonna have scars.

891
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,340
 That you're dating someone and, man,

892
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,300
 they may not be a believer,

893
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,580
 they may not be all in with Jesus,

894
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,940
 but I think I can get 'em there.

895
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,220
 You're not the Holy Spirit.

896
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,200
 And that's not your job.

897
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,420
 Your job is to follow Jesus and run hard after him.

898
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,860
 And God's timing, he brings that person along.

899
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:10,140
 I know in this room, and I'm gonna close right here,

900
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,720
 there are some of you who feel like damaged goods.

901
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,380
 I know 'em, I have family members who feel that way.

902
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,180
 You feel like if there's a godly guy out there,

903
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,220
 maybe a godly girl out there who really loves Jesus,

904
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
 who's all in with him,

905
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,660
 that if he ever looked in your direction,

906
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,960
 he wouldn't wanna date you.

907
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,540
 He wouldn't wanna be a part of that.

908
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,500
 'Cause you look behind, you got a past.

909
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,180
 A past maybe filled with an abortion,

910
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,060
 filled with sexual partners, filled with mistakes,

911
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,780
 one night stands, filled with whatever it is,

912
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,760
 fill in the blank.

913
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,560
 And I want you to know that regardless of the story

914
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,540
 that you have, the reason that someone would not,

915
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,580
 if they are all in with Jesus, want to date you

916
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,220
 is not because of your past.

917
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,380
 It's because of your present and not running after Christ.

918
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,180
 Regardless of your past, it's not a problem for Jesus.

919
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,620
 And it's not a problem for anyone who loves Jesus.

920
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,620
 It often is a platform that God,

921
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,540
 when someone says, "Take my past, take my present,

922
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,680
 "take my life," God says,

923
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,160
 "Man, I'm gonna create an amazing platform out of,

924
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,700
 "and allow you to show how even in the midst of ashes,

925
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,100
 "I make beautiful things."

926
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,440
 If you're someone who thinks, "Man, I'm damaged goods,"

927
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,680
 you've bought a lie.

928
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,940
 And God doesn't ask for you to do away and hide

929
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,420
 and be ashamed of your past.

930
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,840
 He says, "Will you surrender that to me?

931
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,340
 "Surrender your present to me, and you'll have life."

932
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,220
 And I'll write a love story like you've never known,

933
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,340
 because you have got to know,

934
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,940
 if you're gonna experience being in a relationship

935
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,300
 with a spouse in a healthy way,

936
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,260
 they've gotta be someone, and you've gotta be someone

937
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,820
 who knows the ultimate spouse

938
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,260
 that they'll be with for all of eternity.

939
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,220
 You and I, marriage, if we have 75 years, my wife and I,

940
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,660
 if we have 75 years in this life,

941
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,780
 what is that, a page in the Bible?

942
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,780
 I mean, ultimately, if you're gonna have a good spouse,

943
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,620
 or you're gonna be a good spouse,

944
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
 you've gotta know that the story is not about you,

945
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,900
 it's not about me.

946
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,140
 I mean, think about that.

947
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,580
 Like in all of, like the Bible,

948
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,780
 it goes through all these different stories.

949
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,260
 75 years we're together, 75 years, it's amazing.

950
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,540
 We made it through a silver, platinum,

951
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,340
 or whatever anniversary that the Bible would say,

952
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
 this is just one page.

953
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,980
 You're gonna be with that spouse, Jesus,

954
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,860
 which is what the bride of Christ says,

955
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,680
 or is called to be a part of this marriage relationship

956
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,300
 with Christ for all of eternity.

957
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,580
 And if you're gonna marry or have a good marriage

958
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,540
 in this life, you and the other spouse involved

959
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,840
 have to know ultimately who their spouse is.

960
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,860
 And it's having that anchor

961
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,540
 that allows you in the midst of the storm

962
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,220
 to not focus on your feelings, not crash the plane,

963
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,980
 but trust in Him and the instruments

964
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,020
 and the truths that He's given us.

965
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,860
 Let me pray.

966
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,380
 Father, thank you that you're a God

967
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,420
 who shows up to women caught in adultery.

968
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,240
 And you don't condemn 'em,

969
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,700
 but you don't condone what they've done.

970
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,300
 You forgive them.

971
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,500
 As you modeled for us in John chapter eight,

972
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
 I pray for friends in the room

973
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,140
 who've been running, God, would you make amazing marriages

974
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,620
 out of my friends here?

975
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,380
 Would you make the best marriages

976
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,820
 the city of Dallas has ever seen

977
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,400
 from friends that are represented inside of this room?

978
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,460
 But we know that beautiful love stories

979
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,140
 don't come from having the right flowers and hair color.

980
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,140
 They come from having the right God that we worship,

981
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,340
 from knowing what marriage

982
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,480
 and ultimately all of life is about, which is Jesus.

983
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,580
 Father, I pray for amazing relationships.

984
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,080
 I pray for relationships in this room to break up.

985
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,320
 And I pray that they would,

986
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,400
 if that be consistent with what your will is,

987
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,680
 or inconsistent, if the relationship they have

988
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,880
 is inconsistent with your word,

989
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,600
 Father, would you take them down,

990
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,940
 help them trust in you,

991
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,040
 that you're a God who loves and gives good things

992
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,800
 and wants great love and relationships for us.

993
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,600
 We worship you now in song, amen.
