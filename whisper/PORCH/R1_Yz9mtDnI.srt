1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,640
 (phone dialing)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,440
 - You have seven unheard messages.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,120
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,200
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
 - Hey yo Danny, where you at bro?

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,120
 I'll see you soon, all right?

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,240
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,600
 but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,880
 on my heart for a reason.

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,520
 So please call me back.

12
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,880
 - Hey bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,200
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,360
 She's not a farmer, but she is on the market.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,120
 Okay, so hit me back, love you bro.

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,880
 - No, I'm sure this is the right number,

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,800
 but last night was a mistake.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,720
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

19
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,920
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,720
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,040
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,480
 and we need to talk.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 (audience cheering)

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
 - Porsch, how we doing?

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,040
 We doing okay tonight?

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,920
 It's great to see you.

27
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,240
 You're here for a good one.

28
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,960
 We're really excited for where we're going

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,640
 over the course of the evening.

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,080
 So thanks for making the time to be here.

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,360
 Dallas, love that you're in the room as always.

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,080
 We never take that for granted,

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,240
 but special shout out also to everyone

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,640
 that's tuning in online.

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,040
 We love everyone that would choose to give us

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,480
 a little moment of their evening to be a part

37
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,120
 of what God is doing in this room and rooms all over,

38
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,280
 particularly our Porsch Live locations.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
 Shout out Porsch Live, Greater Lafayette, Fresno,

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,520
 and Scottsdale.

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,280
 We all give it up for everybody tuning in online right now.

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,000
 Well, hey, if you were to survey my college roommates

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,360
 and myself, what you would find is we had a lot in common.

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,920
 You see, we were all business majors

45
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,800
 and we were serving in the same organizations.

46
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
 There we go.

47
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,800
 We all played sports in high school,

48
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,840
 which meant we were overly competitive in college

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
 and well past our prime at that point.

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,600
 But it didn't slow us down.

51
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,960
 We were all followers of Jesus.

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,400
 Like we loved reading his word and engaging with his people

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,440
 and doing the best that we could to be faithful to him.

54
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,920
 And we were single,

55
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,040
 meaning that we knew little to nothing

56
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,480
 about the opposite sex.

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,080
 And yet, even though we were single,

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,040
 we were like-minded in the sense that

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,520
 we really wanted to find love.

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
 So over the course of our college career,

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,760
 we all had our fair share of attempts.

62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,740
 We took our shots and we miserably failed

63
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,040
 over the course of our four-year experience.

64
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,560
 You see, we had so much in common,

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,040
 but the minute you injected us with a little bit of love,

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,560
 we found is we did really dumb things.

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,760
 We all went a variety of directions

68
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,720
 because love makes people crazy.

69
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,300
 So just to give you some perspective,

70
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,640
 maybe you'll relate to some of this.

71
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,280
 One of my roommates, he was the hometown heartthrob.

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
 Like the guy, he looked good, he smelled good,

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
 he had great hair.

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,080
 That's not weird, I shared a bathroom with him.

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,260
 We, he had straight, perfectly white teeth.

76
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,780
 He was an athletic guy, built real well.

77
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,600
 There was not a girl that he would ask on a date

78
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,000
 that would not say no to him

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
 because, hey, he was worth a shot.

80
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,080
 And yet, he was a hopeless romantic.

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,380
 He didn't play the field much

82
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,300
 because he had an ideal that he wanted to find.

83
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,880
 So he didn't fall often, but when he fell,

84
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
 he fell very hard.

85
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,480
 You know this guy.

86
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,620
 Another one of my roommates.

87
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,320
 He was the perennial date party favorite.

88
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,080
 He was the guy that girls loved to take to date parties

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,580
 because he had the most disarming personality

90
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,000
 and they just had an incredible time.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
 It was such a blast always having him with them.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,920
 And yet, nothing ever really materialized from that evening.

93
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,140
 The reason why is because he's a pretty chill kind of guy.

94
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,280
 Romance never really rocked him much.

95
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,360
 Another roommate of mine, well, he was clueless.

96
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,440
 So clueless, in fact, that he found himself

97
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,240
 stringing along not one, but two girls at the same night,

98
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,000
 completely unbeknownst to him.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He didn't realize that they were bringing baked goods,

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
 cookies and brownies and muffins

101
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,640
 as a sign of their affection.

102
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,280
 He just thought that they were being friendly,

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,920
 but they had a very different perspective

104
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,680
 on it all together.

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,840
 The fourth of my roommates, he was the classic party guy.

106
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,200
 Like he never took anything seriously except his grades,

107
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,960
 meaning he never took a dating relationship serious,

108
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,500
 but for some reason, he was the one that figured it out

109
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,880
 because lo and behold, one day we looked up

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
 and he was in a relationship.

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,600
 And then there was me.

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,080
 And I was confusing, to say the least,

113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,480
 probably because I was confused.

114
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,400
 I had commitment issues.

115
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,960
 My heart would tell me one thing,

116
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
 but my mind would tell me something different.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
 You see, when you injected us with love,

118
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,200
 what we realized is we were a dizzying array

119
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,160
 of different directions.

120
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,120
 And yet, we all wanted it.

121
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,620
 What was wild is we were a reliable group of dudes.

122
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,540
 We were consistently kind to people.

123
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,060
 We were trustworthy with our word.

124
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,800
 We tried to move with an honorable approach

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,740
 towards other people.

126
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,700
 And yet, the minute we found ourselves falling,

127
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,940
 we started crushing or catching feelings.

128
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,740
 We were anything but predictable.

129
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,620
 Sound like anybody you know?

130
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,020
 You see, love has a polarizing and powerful effect

131
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,780
 on the lives of people.

132
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,080
 In this room alone, there are dozens of different reactions

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,800
 to just the screen behind me.

134
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,520
 You hear that we're in a dating series,

135
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,040
 and some of you, you rolled up tonight because of it,

136
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,520
 that you cannot wait for what's coming in the weeks ahead.

137
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,740
 You've already blocked off your calendar

138
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,040
 because you don't know where we're going,

139
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,200
 but you wanna be here for every single week.

140
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,280
 And yet, some of you, you did not roll up because of it.

141
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
 You rolled your eyes

142
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
 because it's just another dating series at the porch.

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,520
 Others of you, you get the idea of,

144
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,600
 man, I identify with that hopeless romantic.

145
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,520
 I'm hoping that I can find the perfect person.

146
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 Maybe they're down the aisle.

147
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
 While others of you are not hopelessly romantic,

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,460
 you're cautiously optimistic.

149
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,360
 Maybe there's something over the course of these weeks

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,600
 that you'll learn that you have not known before.

151
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,640
 Regardless of where you fall within the spectrum

152
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,640
 on romantic relationships or finding love,

153
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 we all go a different and dizzying direction

154
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,240
 whenever it comes to this specific topic.

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,480
 Some of you, you adopt traditional relationships.

156
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,160
 Others, you move into polyamorous dating.

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,280
 Some of you, you're deep-liking somebody at the office,

158
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,920
 while others are sitting in a situation ship

159
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,280
 where you're reaping all the benefits,

160
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,420
 but you're not actually making any of the commitment.

161
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,560
 Others, you've downloaded

162
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,400
 whatever dating app there is this month,

163
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,000
 and you're scrolling your way along,

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
 trying to filter out who will

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,440
 and who will not earn your affection.

166
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,180
 We go a smattering of different ways

167
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,240
 when this thing comes up.

168
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,200
 And yet, the truth is,

169
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,400
 we all have an intrinsic longing for this thing.

170
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,260
 You are like me and my roommates from school.

171
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:53,840
 And so this series is meant to be a service to you.

172
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,040
 I'll be really clear.

173
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,360
 I'm not diving into this

174
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,840
 because I just want to generate a bunch of likes

175
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,880
 or clicks or approval.

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,720
 That's not our desire.

177
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
 We genuinely want to be helpful

178
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
 over the course of this series.

179
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,160
 And we think the way that we've crafted it,

180
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,440
 will be so for you.

181
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,480
 We know that people want to find relationships.

182
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,220
 There's a deep desire within you individually,

183
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,700
 more than likely to find love,

184
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,400
 no different than ourselves.

185
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,280
 And the reason I know that

186
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,760
 is because the statistics back it up.

187
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,680
 I'm not going to bore you with a bunch of research.

188
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,640
 Trust me, I have done it.

189
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
 I did not want to stand on this stage

190
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,080
 and talk about this topic

191
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
 and not have any credibility in the conversation,

192
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
 but to spare you all of the data,

193
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,960
 I'll share a couple of things,

194
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
 just so you know,

195
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,880
 this is something we broadly want together.

196
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,080
 You see one survey found,

197
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,360
 that within young adults, 85% believe,

198
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,740
 I don't need a long-term relationship

199
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,440
 to find fulfillment in my life.

200
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
 I don't need that.

201
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,240
 85%, that's like the majority of this room.

202
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,680
 And yet within that same survey, 83%.

203
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,040
 So virtually the exact same number said,

204
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,880
 you know what?

205
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,580
 I do anticipate tying the knot at some point in my future.

206
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,100
 That feels wildly confusing.

207
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,680
 What are we saying when we read that survey?

208
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,060
 What we realize is people are saying,

209
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,900
 you know what?

210
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,740
 I don't need love,

211
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,900
 but it sure would be nice to snuggle up

212
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,740
 to someone every single night

213
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,620
 and spend the rest of my life with them.

214
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,260
 Another survey told us, according to Tinder,

215
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
 which is the most downloaded dating app

216
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,340
 among young adults,

217
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,180
 that Gen Z signaled within their relationship goals

218
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,600
 on their profile,

219
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,980
 more than any other intent,

220
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,580
 that they wanted long-term relationships.

221
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,820
 Why is that surprising?

222
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,120
 Because Tinder's not the place

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,980
 where you look for long-term relationships.

224
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,060
 Like their interface is all about hot or not, right?

225
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,220
 Like you swipe depending upon what they look like

226
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,500
 and what their first line is.

227
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,480
 It is not the place to look for long-term relationships.

228
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,220
 And yet even people on Tinder are saying,

229
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,860
 no, that's what I want,

230
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,380
 to bring it outside of the world and into this room.

231
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,980
 We surveyed you.

232
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,540
 And what we realized is that 70% of you

233
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,180
 identified as single.

234
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
 Not to out you like that,

235
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,340
 I don't know how it leaves you feeling,

236
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,940
 but what you need to know is that you also said

237
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,620
 the one serious topic we want to learn about

238
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,140
 is we want to learn about romance in relationships.

239
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,260
 Which you put those things together

240
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,220
 and what you realize is I'm single and I want love.

241
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,380
 Help me figure out the way forward on this.

242
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,500
 It's clear.

243
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,300
 We want relationships.

244
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,460
 We want to find love.

245
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,420
 And yet, as you observe the romantic landscape of our day,

246
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,540
 what you see is that although we want to be

247
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,580
 in a relationship, we are more romantically disconnected

248
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,460
 and discouraged than any other group in history.

249
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,060
 According to Pew Research, 42% of young adults,

250
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,220
 people like you, 42%,

251
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,620
 have never been in a committed relationship.

252
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,540
 Now, that excludes camp crushes and summer flings

253
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,060
 because a committed relationship would be one

254
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,820
 that stands the test of time,

255
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,020
 that says I'm in this for the long haul.

256
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,180
 Roughly half have never found themselves in that spot.

257
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,260
 And yet, despite the fact that that's true,

258
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,700
 we know that nearly half of those would say

259
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,060
 I would commit to a long-term relationship

260
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,740
 upwards of driving three hours if I could find love today.

261
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,980
 Like that's how deep the desire goes.

262
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,060
 In the US Census Bureau, maybe you've heard this before

263
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,420
 because this is passed around a lot

264
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,860
 when it comes to your generation,

265
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,540
 but what you hear is that the average age

266
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,940
 of first marriage has moved further and further

267
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,540
 and further down the timeline.

268
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,460
 At one time, it was 23, 25 years old,

269
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,780
 and yet now it's 28 for girls, and some odd change,

270
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,500
 and 30 for guys, meaning it has grown

271
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,180
 increasingly later in life.

272
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,460
 Why is that?

273
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,860
 Like it begs the question.

274
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,620
 If we have a desire for marriage,

275
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,500
 but there's a delay in that commitment,

276
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,980
 what's the issue?

277
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,260
 What's the reason?

278
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,940
 Well, I think it's pretty plain.

279
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,420
 While we want to find love, we do not know where to look.

280
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,020
 Like that's the summary of those two ideas together.

281
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,940
 And let me just say, like that's not your fault.

282
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,500
 Like I'm not looking at you and pointing at the finger

283
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,340
 and being like, man, everybody in a bygone era,

284
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,180
 they figured this thing out.

285
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,380
 How come you haven't figured it out?

286
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,700
 That's not what I'm saying.

287
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,500
 You have been dealt an interesting hand.

288
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,740
 You live at a time amidst the advent of technology

289
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,500
 and the globalization of society,

290
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,820
 which has created a really sophisticated dating dynamic.

291
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,740
 It's interesting, particularly with Gen Z.

292
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,620
 I know we've got millennials in the room as well,

293
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,500
 but Gen Z is kind of being identified

294
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,660
 as the contradictory generation

295
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,340
 because the day in which we live is confusing.

296
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,780
 It's difficult.

297
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,780
 And yet, though that is true,

298
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,380
 and you can't change the circumstances of your life,

299
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,020
 what's going on in our world,

300
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,260
 it is helpful for us to discern.

301
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,540
 If I have a desire for romantic connection,

302
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,820
 why then is there a delay in my romantic commitment?

303
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,180
 So I wanna share a few reasons with you

304
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,860
 that I think could be helpful.

305
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,420
 The first reason is there's a tendency

306
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,740
 to set unrealistic expectations.

307
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,380
 We paint a picture in our minds,

308
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,100
 make a checklist of all the different things

309
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,660
 that we wanna find in our perfect somebody.

310
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,260
 He'll be this tall, he'll have this hair,

311
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,500
 he'll look this good.

312
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,740
 And yet what we realize is that we're often waiting

313
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,820
 for that person to magically appear in our lives.

314
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,420
 For you ladies, you're looking for someone

315
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,860
 that is ruggedly handsome.

316
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,780
 You want him to be emotionally mature,

317
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,620
 charmingly convincing.

318
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,140
 And yet what you're looking for

319
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,020
 is you're looking for someone that looks like Glenn Powell,

320
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,700
 talks like Harry Styles,

321
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,580
 and processes like Timothee Chalamet.

322
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,220
 And I'll break it to you, you're not gonna find him.

323
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,500
 Like that guy does not exist.

324
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,180
 He for sure is not in this room, nor is he in any room.

325
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,740
 Because the truth of the matter is,

326
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,980
 that is a unicorn and those do not exist.

327
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,060
 Guys, you're much easier.

328
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,180
 You're looking for a Christian Sidney Sweeney.

329
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,300
 You know, like that's kind of the thing

330
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,540
 that you're hoping to find.

331
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,420
 You laugh because you know it's true.

332
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,740
 And yet we have set unrealistic expectations.

333
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,260
 And the truth of the matter is,

334
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,420
 we're holding people to standards

335
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,060
 that we're not willing to hold ourselves

336
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,620
 to the same standard of.

337
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,740
 And because of it, we are delaying our ability

338
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,020
 to commit in relationship.

339
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,220
 I see some guys out there patting each other

340
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,980
 on the shoulder like, yeah, man, that's you.

341
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,460
 The second reason for others of us

342
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,820
 is we're training for variety.

343
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,220
 It's you right there, man.

344
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,180
 We're training for variety.

345
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,620
 We live in a day where you can,

346
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,060
 by just the pull of your phone,

347
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,460
 you can peruse through thousands

348
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,820
 of different romantic suitors

349
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,660
 with just the swipe of your hand.

350
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,700
 And the thing is, you can do it at any time

351
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,900
 and in any place you want.

352
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,980
 You can do it in an Uber,

353
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,780
 you can do it first thing in the morning when you wake up.

354
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,660
 I don't recommend that.

355
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,900
 You can do it when you're at the gym,

356
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,620
 sitting at the office, don't recommend that one either.

357
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,420
 Or, and we know this has actually happened,

358
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,780
 you can do it here in this room.

359
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,700
 We have seen people match with people

360
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,020
 at the porch on a Tuesday night

361
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,020
 that they've passed by 100 times before

362
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,220
 and yet they did not have the courage

363
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,380
 nor boldness to walk up to

364
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,100
 and actually ask them for their number.

365
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,900
 I'm not pointing fingers,

366
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,800
 but the evidence would say,

367
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,860
 long gone are the days, the dangers

368
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,620
 of walking up to someone because you know what?

369
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,980
 They might be worth initiating with face to face.

370
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,780
 Instead, we're worried that might be too cringe.

371
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,860
 And so we choose to avail ourselves

372
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,140
 to all of the endless options

373
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,780
 and we swipe our way along,

374
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,460
 looking at different people and evaluating

375
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,300
 whether or not they're worth my time.

376
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,820
 And we give power to our preferences

377
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,380
 over the dateability of someone.

378
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,620
 And ultimately what we're doing

379
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,560
 is we never commit for fear of missing out on someone better.

380
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,060
 But these are just a couple of reasons.

381
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,340
 Another one would be that we're waiting

382
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,780
 until you're financially settled,

383
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,180
 which I get, like getting married and settling down

384
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,900
 and having kids and buying a house.

385
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,780
 That's all expensive to do.

386
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,420
 And the reality is you're not unwise

387
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,940
 for wanting to be financially prepared for marriage.

388
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,780
 That's a good thing.

389
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,580
 You should be financially prepared.

390
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,620
 But the issue is we're not waiting

391
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,460
 to be financially prepared.

392
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,300
 We're waiting to be financially prominent.

393
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
 So many of you,

394
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,140
 you're not making yourself romantically available

395
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,900
 because what you want is you want to get that job

396
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,940
 or be in that department or move into that neighborhood

397
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,460
 or have this kind of car or take those specific trips.

398
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,860
 And while you want to be dating and married at some point,

399
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,780
 man, that is really inconvenient to my ambitions in life.

400
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,460
 So I'm just going to wait.

401
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,480
 Others of you, you're indulging sexual desire

402
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,860
 and you're not doing it within the confines of marriage

403
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,140
 as God would ordain.

404
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,800
 Instead, you're doing it outside.

405
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,240
 Now, let me be clear.

406
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,740
 You're not typically associated with the hookup generation.

407
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,700
 That was Gen Xers

408
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,620
 and even millennials defended that themselves.

409
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,660
 But what you need to know

410
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,980
 is you are still considered sexually positive.

411
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,420
 One specific researcher quoted that Gen Z specifically

412
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
 is the kinkiest generation yet.

413
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,820
 From hentai pornography to paranormal romance novels

414
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,580
 to friends with benefits.

415
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,580
 Sex is as much on the rise as it has always been.

416
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,200
 People would say, but there's a sex recession.

417
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,700
 There's not a lust recession

418
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,620
 that is still as much an issue today

419
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,740
 as we have seen in decades past.

420
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,300
 Others of you, you're living in a post-pandemic society.

421
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,180
 We all are.

422
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,860
 Like, can we just acknowledge COVID changed things?

423
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,820
 Like, I know that it's weird to talk about

424
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,820
 because that happened back then

425
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,780
 and we don't really like to look in the rear view.

426
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,100
 But the truth is it changed everything

427
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,900
 about the way you live your day.

428
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,260
 It changed so much of what we do

429
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,980
 and where we work and where we live.

430
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,460
 Today, there are more remote work arrangements

431
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,540
 than ever before.

432
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,460
 Hours spent gaming and young adults

433
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,340
 living with their parents than in times past.

434
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,180
 I'm not making an enemy out of any of that

435
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,260
 to be abundantly clear,

436
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,180
 but I just think it's important for us to acknowledge

437
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,380
 the fact that as we've seen an increase in those realities,

438
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,580
 there's likely a correlation

439
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,980
 between the increase of those things

440
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,540
 and an increase we're also seeing

441
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,060
 between individualization,

442
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,980
 sexual dormancy, and friendlessness.

443
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,700
 We're seeing that as we find fewer and fewer opportunities

444
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,340
 to engage with other people and meaningfully connect,

445
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:23,020
 so too are we losing the skillset to socialize

446
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,660
 in a way that will lead to relationship.

447
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,380
 Others, you're adopting alternative relationship structures.

448
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,500
 Things like poly dating and ethical non-monogamy

449
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,420
 and open relationships are more prevalent now than ever.

450
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,780
 And while it seems to make logical sense

451
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,900
 and get a fuller sexual experience,

452
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,700
 you're able to explore a variety of different forms of love,

453
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,420
 you're less pressured to fulfill your partner,

454
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,580
 what happens is when people spread themselves

455
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,980
 between their social circle,

456
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,820
 they find that they are losing the ability

457
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,300
 to commit and care for an individual person

458
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,780
 and serve their soul.

459
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,540
 These are just some of the reasons

460
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,940
 why we're seeing a desire for a romantic connection

461
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,060
 ultimately met with a delay in romantic commitment.

462
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,980
 I don't know how that leaves you feeling.

463
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,700
 I know that as I processed it,

464
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,420
 read all the articles, looked at all the data,

465
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,660
 studied the statistics, and I did a lot of that,

466
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,740
 I realized that while we're looking for a good

467
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,060
 and a right thing,

468
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,900
 we are looking at a bad in a wrong way.

469
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,860
 So tonight, before we dive into all the hard questions

470
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,140
 that we're going to investigate in this series,

471
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,700
 things like why am I still single

472
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
 and is dating supposed to be this hard

473
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,980
 and why does this keep happening to me

474
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,780
 and how far is too far?

475
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,580
 As we look at all those questions,

476
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,900
 I think that before we get into any of them,

477
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,980
 we need to answer a preliminary question first.

478
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,380
 And that question is, will I ever find love?

479
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,660
 Will I ever find love?

480
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,740
 Because the reality is, as we look at the romantic landscape

481
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,420
 it does not look encouraging.

482
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,460
 When you consider where people are seeking instead,

483
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,260
 it doesn't look like anyone is ultimately discovering.

484
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,060
 And so tonight I want to help you find it.

485
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,260
 I want you to find love.

486
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,020
 I think it's possible.

487
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,380
 But we have to look in the right place.

488
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,300
 And so to help us figure out where that place is,

489
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,700
 you can turn with me to Genesis chapter two.

490
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,580
 It's the second page of your Bible.

491
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,860
 I know that was a lot of setup.

492
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,260
 We'll get into the scripture now.

493
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,820
 I just want to make sure we make a really good case for this

494
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,220
 before we get in.

495
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,820
 While you're turning there, let me just say this.

496
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,540
 Fundamental to everything we just walked through,

497
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,620
 all that myriad of reasons for why we're doing

498
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,060
 the things we're doing is actually a fundamentally

499
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,460
 good reason to seek love.

500
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,060
 And it's three things.

501
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,180
 Number one, we have a desire for connection

502
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,500
 and not just casual connection,

503
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,260
 but meaningful connection to other people.

504
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,460
 We want to link arms with someone

505
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,020
 and journey through life, through the highs and the lows.

506
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,380
 We want to race forward and find great companionship.

507
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,820
 Secondly, we want fulfillment.

508
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,260
 Not just that someone makes me happy,

509
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,460
 but we want someone that can come alongside us

510
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,780
 and help us achieve and develop and grow and succeed

511
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,900
 in the things that we think we've been called to.

512
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,380
 If you're a believer, particularly the things

513
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,500
 that God has called you to.

514
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,540
 And then thirdly, we want intimacy.

515
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,380
 Like we want someone to accept us

516
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,380
 and not just us on our best day, but us on our worst day.

517
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,980
 We want people to move near to us.

518
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,060
 We want people to know us.

519
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,860
 We want to be loved.

520
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,060
 And these are good things to desire.

521
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,060
 But more than that, they're not just good reasons

522
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,380
 to seek love, they're God reasons to seek love.

523
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,660
 We see that in the very beginning of the Bible

524
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,540
 as he starts talking to the very first relationship

525
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,220
 in human history, he unpacks for them

526
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,060
 the very reasons why he has brought them together.

527
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,380
 And it's these reasons, this is what we're gonna see

528
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,300
 in that first relationship as man and woman

529
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,460
 find love together, what they're going to also see

530
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,140
 is they particularly find a love with God.

531
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,420
 And so here's what we'll do.

532
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,700
 We'll look at a handful of verses in Genesis 1 and 2.

533
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,900
 We'll start in two, and you can just kind of track

534
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,020
 with me as we go.

535
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,980
 We're gonna look at verse 18 first, Genesis 2, 18.

536
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,820
 This is what it says.

537
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,740
 "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good

538
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,100
 that man should be alone.

539
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,860
 I will make a helper fit for him.'"

540
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,420
 Let me just ask, don't you just feel so seen by God

541
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,940
 when you read that?

542
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,220
 It's not good for man to be alone.

543
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,260
 Thank you, God, I agree.

544
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,780
 Please send someone soon.

545
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,940
 Like this scripture is certainly speaking

546
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,220
 to your longing for relationship.

547
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,500
 That's not a bad thing.

548
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,900
 But what you need to know is that in Genesis 2,

549
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,660
 what's in view here is actually bigger than marriage.

550
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,740
 What God is speaking to is he's speaking

551
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,940
 to something more significant that's not just available

552
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,980
 for the select few who find themselves

553
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,460
 in covenantal relationship, but for all his people

554
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,420
 that find themselves in God's family.

555
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,420
 Because that word man in Hebrew is the word human,

556
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,420
 which means it's not good for human to be alone.

557
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,580
 God is not saying it isn't good for a guy to be single.

558
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,340
 He's saying it isn't good for a person to be lonely,

559
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,020
 which many of you hear that and you're like,

560
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,820
 yeah, man, I get that.

561
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,860
 That makes complete sense to me

562
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,300
 because in this room right now,

563
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,940
 we are here for yes, a smattering of different reasons.

564
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,540
 Some of you are here 'cause you wanna see your community

565
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,500
 and others of you are here

566
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,660
 because you're serving here tonight.

567
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
 Others of you, you're here

568
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,260
 because you want to meet someone new.

569
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,500
 Others of you are here because you wanna meet

570
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,420
 that special person that's gonna be new.

571
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,580
 You're trying to stoke the fire.

572
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,140
 You know, like you're trying to make moves in this space

573
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,940
 and the reality is whatever your reasons may be,

574
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,740
 we are all here more than likely

575
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,480
 because we want to meet other people,

576
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,980
 engage with other people.

577
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,300
 We want to connect to other people.

578
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,180
 And God says, hey, that's a good thing.

579
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,860
 You want meaningful connection to other people.

580
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,700
 I want you to have a meaningful connection to other people.

581
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,160
 When you read this account,

582
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,780
 particularly when you go back to Genesis 1

583
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,900
 and you look at the creation account,

584
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,100
 what you see is God gets into kind of a rhythm

585
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,980
 for how he's creating the world.

586
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,580
 He creates day one, day two, day three,

587
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,940
 and every single day, it's good.

588
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,320
 He makes light and dark and it's good.

589
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,700
 He makes sea and sky and it's good.

590
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,540
 He makes land and vegetation and it's good.

591
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,040
 But when you get to the end of his creation narrative,

592
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,940
 what you find is that he looks upon Adam

593
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,240
 and he says for the very first time, that's not good.

594
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,780
 It's not good that man is alone,

595
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,060
 which begs the million dollar question.

596
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,660
 What makes something good?

597
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,540
 It's relationship.

598
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,780
 It's togetherness.

599
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,860
 And the reason we know that is because as God creates,

600
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,780
 you can go and track this.

601
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,620
 As he creates, he creates everything

602
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,120
 with a corresponding companion.

603
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,800
 He creates light and dark and to them,

604
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,380
 he gives sun, moon, and stars.

605
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,580
 He creates sea and sky and to it,

606
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,740
 he gives fish and birds of the air

607
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,300
 to land and vegetation.

608
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,660
 He gives beasts of the field and humanity itself.

609
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,700
 And yet when you get to Genesis two and you zoom in,

610
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,460
 you see that God, he looks at upon Adam

611
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,140
 and he realizes there's something not good here.

612
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,360
 And it's the fact that there's no good companion for him.

613
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,700
 So he makes Eve.

614
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,900
 You ever thought about that?

615
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,640
 Like why did God make Eve for Adam?

616
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,120
 Like there's a whole world of created beings,

617
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,940
 other creatures that Adam,

618
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,900
 I mean, he kind of swipes left all the way through

619
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,820
 and he realizes none of these are suitable for me.

620
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,780
 And what he realizes is that man,

621
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,980
 God could have set him up with a horse,

622
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,380
 you know, cowboys, they use horses.

623
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,460
 That's a good partner animal.

624
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,040
 Or, you know, maybe he wasn't a dog person.

625
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,780
 You know, I guess that man's best friend

626
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,380
 wouldn't really work as a suitable helper.

627
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,220
 It begs the question,

628
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,780
 what was the reason for which he needed a companion?

629
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,460
 Well, we see it in Genesis one,

630
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,700
 we get the answer, verse 26.

631
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,700
 And then God said, let us make man in our image

632
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,820
 after our likeness.

633
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,220
 So God created man in his own image.

634
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,220
 In the image of God, he created him male and female.

635
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,340
 He created them.

636
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,140
 It's interesting when you read the creation account,

637
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,220
 you see God, he speaks everything into being,

638
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,940
 but then he slows down when he comes to man

639
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,180
 and he actually makes man himself.

640
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,440
 To dignify the ladies in the room,

641
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,940
 everything is a voice or dust,

642
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,180
 but when he makes her, he fashions her from Adam.

643
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:59,060
 You see, God, he desires an intentional relationship with us

644
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,900
 and the reason why he brings us to one another

645
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,540
 is because he knows what we need to know,

646
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,060
 which is we reflect God's love when we connect to others.

647
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,860
 We reflect God's love when we connect to others.

648
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,080
 Like one person cannot reflect God alone.

649
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,200
 We need each other for that purpose.

650
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,180
 It's through a relationship to someone

651
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,200
 that this is possible.

652
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,440
 If you think about it, God,

653
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,360
 he is three co-equal, co-eternal persons

654
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,080
 and yet he is one in essence all at the same time.

655
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,720
 He is father, son, and Holy Spirit.

656
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,880
 And yet what he is doing is he brings Adam to Eve,

657
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,440
 is he brings not three in one, but two to one.

658
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,320
 And he says, I want you to experience the same depth

659
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,560
 and meaning of relationship that I myself experience,

660
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,880
 the kind of loving union I have in my own person

661
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,200
 because I want you to relate to me.

662
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,960
 I stand in the altar of weddings all the time.

663
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,360
 I get the privilege of officiating different couples

664
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
 that are tying the knot.

665
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,320
 And it's one of my favorite things to say to them,

666
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,500
 hey, what you're doing today is so significant

667
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,940
 for a variety of reasons.

668
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,700
 And yet one of the biggest reasons it's so significant

669
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,200
 is the two of you come together,

670
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,720
 you're actually getting to taste a little piece

671
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,340
 of what God experiences within himself.

672
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,140
 You see, God, he is consisting of deeply meaningful

673
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,280
 and intimately connected relationships.

674
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,600
 And that's what you get to be a part of

675
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,740
 whenever you find yourself in marriage.

676
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,060
 You see, that's why if you want to find love,

677
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,000
 you have to find God.

678
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,680
 If you wanna find love, you gotta find God

679
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,000
 because he made it.

680
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,120
 I don't know if you've thought of that,

681
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,960
 but he's actually the one that came up with the idea.

682
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,620
 It's not just that he created love.

683
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,200
 You actually read that God is love.

684
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,080
 Three times in the scriptures,

685
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,480
 you see that God identifies as something,

686
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,840
 that his very essence is something, love, light, and spirit.

687
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,760
 And yet when he says, I am love,

688
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,880
 he's saying, as I've created all things,

689
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,620
 I have woven love into the fabric of it all.

690
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,520
 And so if you want to find love in your life,

691
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,800
 you need to find him.

692
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,840
 Like, if your car breaks down,

693
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,880
 you're probably not just gonna pop the hood

694
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,680
 and just start tinkering around

695
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,300
 if you don't actually know what's going on.

696
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,140
 Why?

697
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,520
 Because that could be consequential.

698
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,320
 It could actually set you back more money

699
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,140
 than if you just opened the user's manual

700
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,780
 and asked the people that actually knew what was going on.

701
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,300
 That's what we have to do with love.

702
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,460
 God is hardwired into your heart,

703
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,680
 this longing for connection.

704
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,580
 And the reason he did is he wants you

705
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,140
 to experience what he experiences.

706
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,580
 Isn't that amazing?

707
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,720
 How kind of God is that?

708
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,760
 Now, as I say that,

709
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,020
 I know what some of you are wondering, Kylan,

710
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,540
 but I'm single.

711
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,620
 So are you telling me that I'm never gonna be able

712
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,360
 to understand the love of God

713
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,880
 because I don't have a spouse?

714
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,420
 No, that's not what I'm saying.

715
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,900
 Because what we realize is this is, again,

716
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,940
 it's not just mainly about marriage,

717
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,020
 it's about relationship.

718
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,500
 And in Christ, we have found not just a salvation from sin,

719
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,420
 but a salvation to one another.

720
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,620
 We have been intimately acquainted to one another.

721
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,620
 We've been united by his blood to other people.

722
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,700
 He's given you relationship,

723
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,460
 meaningful connection to other believers,

724
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,260
 which means, as Paul says in Galatians 3:28,

725
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,160
 "There's neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free,

726
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,020
 "male nor female, for you are all one in Christ."

727
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,740
 Meaning, yes, marriage is one way

728
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,900
 of being meaningfully connected to someone,

729
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,300
 but it's not the only way

730
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,340
 of being meaningfully connected to someone.

731
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,200
 So listen to me,

732
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,200
 you don't have to lower your standards to feel accepted.

733
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,820
 You don't have to rush to the altar with the wrong person,

734
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,540
 which some of you are doing right now,

735
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,820
 just so you can feel loved.

736
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,620
 You don't need to move in with your boyfriend

737
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
 or your girlfriend,

738
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,340
 that way you can feel like you're finally adulting.

739
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,860
 You certainly don't need to indulge a situationship

740
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,560
 just to get your emotional needs met.

741
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,060
 That's a proliferate problem in the church.

742
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,240
 Because with Jesus, you're not alone.

743
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,240
 You have us.

744
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,320
 Like Jesus is gathering a people to himself,

745
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,760
 and we're diverse, different languages,

746
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,200
 and different colors, and different personalities,

747
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,280
 and different occupations, and different backgrounds,

748
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,000
 and he's pulling us together,

749
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,160
 not just so we can be with him,

750
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,840
 but so we can be with one another.

751
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,960
 There's meaningful connection right here.

752
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,140
 You can relate to the love of God

753
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,900
 because you can relate to our love.

754
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,160
 You don't have to search for it in a spouse

755
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,700
 because you can seek it right here.

756
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,580
 That's the first thing.

757
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,420
 And it's an amazing thing,

758
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,140
 but God doesn't stop there.

759
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,060
 Because while we see God's plan for meaningful connection,

760
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,060
 we also see that he has a purpose for that connection.

761
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,900
 You see, Adam had a job to do,

762
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,420
 and yet he couldn't do that job alone.

763
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,600
 He needed a partner,

764
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,420
 which he doesn't find without a fair bit of effort,

765
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,260
 mind you.

766
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,380
 Again, God set that guy up,

767
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
 he who was single for less time

768
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,180
 than anybody else in all creation,

769
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,900
 and God was like, "Hey, you better get to work, man.

770
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,940
 "Name all these animals."

771
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,020
 And he did it.

772
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,260
 Like he seized the moment.

773
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,340
 He wasn't just pining away about what might be.

774
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,600
 He literally, he leveraged his singleness

775
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,980
 to do what God was asking.

776
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,580
 He knew I have a purpose in my life right now,

777
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,780
 and I'm gonna go fulfill it.

778
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,380
 And yet as he did it, he realized,

779
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,800
 "But God, I've searched everywhere, and she's not here.

780
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,160
 "Please help me, God.

781
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,980
 "There's no one to support me, partner with me,

782
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,500
 "actually serve as my companion

783
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,020
 "on this mission that you've given me."

784
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,800
 And so God, ultimately, he brings him in Eve.

785
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,460
 Now, what does he bring him Eve for?

786
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,860
 Well, we learn in Genesis 1, 28, it says this,

787
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,580
 "And God blessed them after making both Adam and Eve.

788
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,240
 "And he said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply,

789
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,320
 "'and fill the earth and subdue it,

790
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,100
 "'and have dominion over the fish of the sea,

791
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
 "'and the birds and the heavens,

792
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,620
 "'and over every living thing that moves on the earth.'"

793
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,700
 You see, not only did God make man and woman in his image,

794
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,240
 but he made man and woman with his mission.

795
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,700
 God wants us to relate to his love

796
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,620
 through our union to one another,

797
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:21,740
 but he also wants us to cultivate his love

798
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,180
 on mission to this world.

799
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,100
 That's what God has invited us to be a part of.

800
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,100
 But here's the thing, in order to achieve that mission,

801
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,300
 we need someone else.

802
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,660
 That's why it says that Adam needed a helper fit for him.

803
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,540
 You see, he needed someone to help him

804
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,300
 not just experience God's love, but express God's love,

805
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,900
 which is your second point.

806
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,680
 When we experience the love of God,

807
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,340
 we express the love of God.

808
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,960
 And so Adam, he gets a helper.

809
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,400
 Now, ladies, don't bristle at the idea of helper.

810
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,620
 I don't have time to unpack this in depth,

811
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,140
 but what you need to know is the Hebrew there,

812
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,060
 which is etzer kenegdo is used 21 times

813
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,620
 in the Old Testament, 16 of which are used of God himself.

814
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,580
 He's a rescuer, deliverer.

815
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,000
 He is a savior to his people, and he is a helper.

816
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,100
 So you are on par with the Lord's own self-identification

817
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,400
 in this moment, meaning that she is not above Adam

818
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,740
 nor below Adam, she is side by side with Adam

819
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,620
 'cause she is equal in dignity,

820
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,020
 yet distinct in nature or role.

821
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,140
 So it's kind of like when you go and you put up a tent.

822
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,740
 Anytime you start the process of putting up a tent,

823
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,240
 what do you do?

824
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,940
 We pull all the poles out, you put them together,

825
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,900
 and then you identify those first two cross beams

826
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,220
 because you know those two beams together provide structure.

827
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,380
 If you didn't have them both, what would you have?

828
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,540
 Not a tent, probably a sail,

829
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,260
 which isn't useful for providing shelter

830
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,620
 or structure for anyone.

831
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,460
 You need both.

832
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,780
 You need not just one, but two

833
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,780
 that are equally long and equally strong

834
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,620
 for the job at hand.

835
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,780
 And so that's what God has done in giving Adam Eve.

836
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,260
 He has given him someone that is opposite of him,

837
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,260
 but equal to him, distinct, but equal,

838
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,820
 because the potential of one

839
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,780
 depends on the presence of the other.

840
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,460
 Adam's potential depends on the presence of Eve.

841
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,740
 Now, let me be clear.

842
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,420
 His potential depends on her,

843
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,700
 not in the sense that she exists to fulfill him.

844
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,820
 That's a crazy idea,

845
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,980
 this thought that I must find her so she will complete me.

846
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,380
 That is not at all what this is talking about,

847
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,540
 and nor should it be any sort of expectation

848
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,380
 on your life, ladies.

849
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,300
 If you have a man in your life that is looking at you

850
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,260
 and saying, "You must complete me.

851
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,060
 "You must awaken all the dormant desire within my soul.

852
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,820
 "You must curb every craving that I have,"

853
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,780
 get away from that guy, please,

854
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,940
 because that is an unbearable expectation

855
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,820
 to put on another person.

856
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,380
 You cannot bear it,

857
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,900
 and so you will ultimately disappoint him.

858
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,860
 That's not what this is talking about.

859
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,420
 This is not talking about helping fulfill someone's being,

860
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,420
 but helping fulfill someone's calling.

861
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,660
 Adam had a calling on his life,

862
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,500
 and so God gives him Eve so that way he can fulfill it.

863
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,420
 That's what she's doing,

864
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,980
 and that's what we do for one another,

865
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,820
 not just as husbands and wives,

866
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,260
 but as brothers and sisters to each other in Christ.

867
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,360
 This is the amazing thing.

868
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,700
 This is not solely reserved for whenever you find love,

869
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,540
 whenever you say, "I do,"

870
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,260
 whenever you hear the wedding bells

871
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,740
 and you march forward into marriage.

872
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,620
 This is not reserved for that moment.

873
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,660
 You see, we have received Christ's love,

874
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,980
 and so now we can share that love with the world.

875
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
 Like, we can continue the work

876
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,740
 of our first father and mother.

877
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,900
 We can cultivate the earth.

878
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
 We can take our classrooms,

879
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,380
 and we can make them into environments

880
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,220
 where children actually flourish.

881
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,420
 We can make our nursing rounds,

882
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,400
 and as we go, we can really carefully see the people

883
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,300
 that we're taking care of.

884
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,640
 We can hop on Zoom for that one-on-one or that team meeting,

885
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,900
 and we can make sure that there's time,

886
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,060
 not just for feedback, but for encouragement.

887
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
 We can organize our teams,

888
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,620
 and we can make sure that within our team environments,

889
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,540
 there's time for celebration as well.

890
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,100
 We want to be people who have received love and share love,

891
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,700
 who have experienced love and now express that love

892
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,720
 and bring forth flourishing into the rest of the world.

893
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,700
 This is what God's calling you into,

894
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,900
 and yet so many of us,

895
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,660
 we're waiting for that partner to come along into our lives

896
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,820
 so that way we can ultimately do what's fulfilling,

897
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,460
 feel fulfilled, and yet God's saying,

898
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,980
 "You don't have to wait for that.

899
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,940
 "You already have people around you

900
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,900
 "that can help you in that work."

901
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,340
 You see, you don't have to pair off with a person

902
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,820
 to feel fulfilled,

903
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,500
 because God has already united you

904
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,220
 into a purpose that is fulfilling.

905
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,940
 You tracking with that?

906
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,340
 That's his story.

907
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,340
 Like, the world was absent of love,

908
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,880
 and yet Christ came to give that love,

909
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,280
 not just so we could hoard that love

910
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,260
 but so that we could keep that love,

911
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,540
 but so that way we could extend that love,

912
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,060
 we could share it to other people.

913
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,580
 That way, they would feel meaningfully connected to us

914
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,140
 the same way we are to one another,

915
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,420
 and they could begin to be a part of the mission

916
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,160
 which we ourselves have been assigned to.

917
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,180
 Now, as I say all of that, here's the thing.

918
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,540
 I know some of you are here,

919
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,940
 and you're like, "Brother, I thought this was

920
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,140
 "a dating series.

921
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,260
 "This feels like a bait and switch."

922
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,120
 Like, I showed up expecting you to give me practical help

923
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,780
 on how to fix what's going on over here,

924
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:31,780
 or quick solutions so that way I could find someone special.

925
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,180
 This isn't what I thought it would be.

926
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,520
 And listen, I don't necessarily disagree with you,

927
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,260
 but I am somewhat discontent with this.

928
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,700
 Sure, meaningful connection with other people

929
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,940
 and not particularly with one only person,

930
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,620
 sure, I'm okay with that.

931
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,440
 Well, you know what, man?

932
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,280
 Yeah, you know what?

933
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,100
 It is crazy for me to think

934
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,660
 that one person will ever fulfill me.

935
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,220
 God probably has a purpose for my life

936
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,340
 that is going to be more fulfilling.

937
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
 I agree to that, but here's the thing, Kylan,

938
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,180
 before you move to this third one

939
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,780
 and you start talking to me about intimacy,

940
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,060
 what you need to realize is I don't just want that

941
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,400
 spiritually speaking, I want that romantically, please.

942
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,320
 God gets that, because that's where the passage ends.

943
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,920
 He's not diminishing your desire for love.

944
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,820
 You're longing for romance.

945
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,580
 As he continues, he actually shows you a picture of intimacy

946
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:25,640
 the likes of which we should all hope be true of our lives.

947
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,260
 We see it in Genesis 2, 24, 25.

948
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,300
 Like after God creates Eve,

949
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,180
 he brings her down the aisle of that very first wedding

950
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,240
 and he hands her over to the groom, Adam,

951
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,060
 and the wedding bells sound and they go on their merry way.

952
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,500
 And we read this,

953
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,340
 that a man shall leave his father and his mother

954
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,420
 and hold fast to his wife.

955
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,380
 That is romantic.

956
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,360
 And they shall become one flesh, more romantic.

957
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,020
 And the man and his wife were both naked

958
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,060
 and were not ashamed.

959
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,100
 That's about as intimate as it gets.

960
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,260
 They were naked and unashamed.

961
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,180
 What a beautiful picture.

962
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,260
 They're fully exposed to one another.

963
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,560
 They have nothing to hide.

964
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,220
 And they're fully embraced by the other.

965
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,780
 They have nothing to regret.

966
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,500
 Don't you want that?

967
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,540
 It lasts all about one page for this couple.

968
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:35,100
 They don't make it very far into the marriage

969
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,940
 before they realize that they're not enough.

970
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,340
 Perfect relationship.

971
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,660
 Perfect connection to each other.

972
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,340
 A perfect purpose to fulfill with one another.

973
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,620
 Perfect intimacy to enjoy together.

974
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:57,520
 And yet it ultimately falls to pieces around them.

975
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,460
 Why?

976
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,140
 Because they forgot God's love

977
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,280
 and they found self-love.

978
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,060
 And when they did, sin entered into the world

979
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,260
 and it broke everything.

980
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,820
 It took their connection and it shattered it.

981
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,860
 It took their purpose, all the fulfillment

982
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,020
 they were going to find, and it stole it.

983
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,060
 And it took their intimacy,

984
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,260
 that beautiful picture of what we just read,

985
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,820
 and they lost it.

986
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:44,100
 If we don't find a love with God,

987
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:49,440
 then we will not find a love like we want.

988
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,700
 We have to start with Him.

989
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,180
 That's where we have to begin.

990
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,760
 And that's why we've started here this evening.

991
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,420
 I remember years ago,

992
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,360
 when I was working in a different young adult ministry,

993
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,860
 we would have these prayer and worship nights,

994
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,740
 and there was one evening in specific

995
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,460
 where we looked at the room, a room of about 500 people,

996
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,220
 and we said, "Hey, we want you to just write down

997
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,900
 "whatever you need to confess to the Lord,

998
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,040
 "something you need to surrender to Him here tonight.

999
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,620
 "Maybe you haven't told Him, you can just write it down.

1000
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,500
 "You don't have to say it out loud.

1001
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,740
 "You can just say it to Him and you can leave it here

1002
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,140
 "and you can actually move forward.

1003
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,660
 "Maybe it's the first time of honest confession

1004
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,500
 "in your life."

1005
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,820
 And so we watched people write them down

1006
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,860
 and leave these behind.

1007
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,780
 And as we took them and we prayed and privately processed,

1008
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,140
 what we found was heartbreaking,

1009
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,420
 because what we saw written on these confession cards

1010
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,420
 were sins of lost love, broken trust,

1011
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,900
 lustful addiction, and hurting heart.

1012
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,820
 And what was wild about it, so overwhelming to me,

1013
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,500
 is it more than doubled the second most confessed sin

1014
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,340
 that people left behind.

1015
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,100
 People had been hurt in their pursuit of love.

1016
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,140
 I don't want you to experience the same.

1017
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,980
 The truth is, many of you have.

1018
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,700
 The truth is, many of you will.

1019
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:15,660
 And yet, if you want to find love, you must find God.

1020
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,220
 You have to find Him yourself.

1021
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,700
 And you gotta find somebody that's found Him too.

1022
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,460
 We have to look for love where we forgot love.

1023
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,540
 That's the final point.

1024
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,860
 You find love where you forgot love.

1025
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,180
 We forgot it.

1026
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,140
 In that we forgot God, the giver of it.

1027
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,940
 We left Him in the garden.

1028
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,860
 We chose our own way.

1029
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,820
 And as we forgot Him, we lost everything.

1030
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,020
 And yet God, in His gracious kindness,

1031
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,740
 He looks at us and says, "I'll come for you again."

1032
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,300
 I know that this may not have been the start to the series

1033
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,140
 that you were thinking it was gonna be,

1034
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,100
 but it's the place that we need to be.

1035
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,660
 We're gonna get to how to date and who to date

1036
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,060
 and how to break up and how to move on.

1037
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,580
 All of that stuff will come.

1038
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,780
 And it will be easy if we get this right.

1039
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:19,780
 We have to find love, and we find it by finding Him.

1040
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,100
 And the reason we know that is because

1041
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,980
 when we had forgotten about God before,

1042
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,020
 God did not forget about us,

1043
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,660
 in that He sent Christ to come get us.

1044
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,900
 He sent our husband, our King, to come after us,

1045
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,900
 to fight for us, to die for us, and to rise for us.

1046
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,740
 So that way, we might not live a life

1047
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,420
 where we're meaningfully disconnected,

1048
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,740
 but meaningfully connected, both to Him and to one another.

1049
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,620
 That we might step into a reality

1050
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,420
 where our world is one filled with fulfillment

1051
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,140
 because we live a life that is bigger than that of ourselves.

1052
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,740
 We're racing towards the things of God instead.

1053
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,940
 And because of Christ, we know that we can find love again

1054
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,700
 because love has found us.

1055
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,980
 Have you found Christ?

1056
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:19,060
 If you do not, then the rest of this is useless.

1057
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:25,420
 You have to begin with Him if you want to end with love.

1058
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,700
 Let me pray that you would.

1059
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,460
 God, thank you for tonight, for your word,

1060
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,580
 and the sufficiency of it, the truth of it,

1061
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,100
 the fact, God, that it meets us where we are,

1062
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,540
 but it pushes us, God, where we need be.

1063
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,620
 That's how gracious you are, Jesus.

1064
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,460
 You're full of compassion that you meet us right here

1065
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,460
 in whatever sort of circumstance we walked in with tonight.

1066
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,620
 You're not disappointed, you're not angry,

1067
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,020
 you're not mad nor upset.

1068
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,100
 You see us where we are and in compassion,

1069
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,540
 you stoop to meet us.

1070
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:07,220
 And in your care, you take us from that place

1071
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,180
 and into one that's better.

1072
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,500
 You move us into your likeness.

1073
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,820
 You lead us into your love.

1074
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,140
 And so it's to you, Jesus, that we say,

1075
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,420
 before we do anything else,

1076
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,020
 before we actually pursue a relationship with someone else,

1077
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,220
 we wanna pursue a relationship with you.

1078
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,380
 We've gotta get this right

1079
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,180
 if we're gonna get anything else right.

1080
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,420
 And so, God, we humbly sit here and say,

1081
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:32,420
 it's you that we want.

1082
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:37,060
 We have found our love again.

1083
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,140
 And it's to you that we worship.

1084
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:46,100
 We're grateful, God, that in you we have all we need.

1085
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:52,300
 And we're expecting, God, that in you we'll find more

1086
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,940
 than we could ever want.

1087
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,180
 It's in your name we pray, amen.
