[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.500]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.160]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.240]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.680]   - Hey yo, Danny!
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.400]   Where you at, bro?
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.320]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.680]   but I feel like the word keeps putting you back
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   on my heart for a reason.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.600]   So please call me back.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.960]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.280]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.760]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.200]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.960]   - No, I'm sure this is the right number,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.880]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.800]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.000]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.800]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.120]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.560]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.080]   - It's great to see you.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.560]   Welcome, like I don't know if you've been tracking with us
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.520]   over the course of this summer, through this series,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.280]   or maybe this is your first time in the room,
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.720]   but we're so grateful that you would choose
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   to be with us here this Tuesday night.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.840]   Not just those of you in the room, though you look great,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.200]   but everybody that is in the chapel right now,
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.400]   special shout out to you guys.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.280]   We're so glad that you didn't let the space constraints
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.120]   keep you away.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.040]   You still made the effort to get in the room.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   And then also those that are in the loft,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.080]   we've opened up another space because, you know,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.520]   the people are coming and we're grateful to provide a seat
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.000]   and read the word of God together.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800]   You know, we're really excited for where we're going tonight
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   because we are continuing the series, which has been awesome.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720]   If you haven't been with us, then don't worry.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.840]   You're not gonna, you're gonna be able to catch up
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.720]   to speed really quickly.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.640]   But I'm also really excited because tonight
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   we have a very special guest in the room.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.440]   You see here at the porch, we're really careful
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.480]   about the people who we put on the stage
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   because we want to do a really good job
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.080]   of rightly dividing the word of truth for you.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.040]   We believe that the gospel is too important.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.800]   So we want to put people here that we deeply,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240]   deeply trust.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.680]   And tonight we have someone that we definitely trust.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.400]   He's been here before, but if you've never heard him speak,
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.720]   then you are in for a treat.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.560]   He is the voice of the most spiritually formative years
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.400]   of my life.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   When I was in college, I had the benefit of sitting
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.640]   in seats just like yours and listen to him
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.240]   unpack the beauties of the gospel,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.600]   really teach about the unified story
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.200]   that was pointing to the person of Jesus.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.920]   And he is a formative voice for me today.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.360]   And I'm so grateful that you're gonna get to hear from him.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.960]   Porch, do an amazing job and help me welcome our friend,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.200]   Ben Stewart to the stage.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.800]   - All right, howdy!
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.520]   Hey, it's good to see, oh, okay, that's fun, all right.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.360]   Hey, it is so good to be here for a number of reasons.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.440]   I'm excited about what we're gonna look at today
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.560]   in God's word, but I just need to let y'all know
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280]   that I am a huge fan of the pastor of this church,
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.200]   T.A. and his wife, Kat, who are over here.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800]   And I am a huge, yeah, that's, yeah,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.100]   you can celebrate them if you weren't certain.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.480]   You can, it's okay, we can talk.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.840]   Just felt like we all weren't sure.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.120]   It's a dance, we're learning.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.200]   And I'm a huge fan of Kylan and his wife, Brooke, too,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.040]   who you just saw on stage right here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.280]   Let me tell you why I'm a fan, particularly these two men,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.180]   why I'm a fan of them.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.920]   I've had the privilege of knowing them for a very long time,
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   and I've watched both of them go through difficult seasons,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.120]   be handed challenging things,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.120]   be put in the crucible of suffering by God.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.760]   And I've watched both of those men navigate it
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.520]   with humility and with grace.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.560]   And I've had the privilege of watching God
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.440]   carve character into those guys.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.000]   And so to see them on this stage
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.060]   and to see them stewarding this church,
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.840]   stewarding this movement of you,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.040]   watching these two men do this,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.560]   it honestly makes me excited for you
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.480]   because I know God's formed those men in the secret places
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.960]   so he could put them up in front of you and say,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.140]   "Follow them as you follow Christ."
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.160]   And so I've just been excited all day
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.480]   because I just love these guys a lot.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   I love their families a lot.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.240]   I love what God's done in their life.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.800]   I like what he's doing through them.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.200]   And you're welcome, Dallas, from God.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   I didn't do it, but just that God's given you
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   some amazing leaders.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.800]   So can we honor these guys and ladies too?
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.060]   Just very excited.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.880]   (congregation applauding)
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.920]   All right, if you have a copy of your scriptures,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.080]   we're gonna be in Genesis chapter 24.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.720]   And I'm gonna read to you several verses of Genesis 24,
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.520]   just to load it in our minds, I'll pray,
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.860]   and then we'll talk about it together.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.620]   So Genesis chapter 24, I'm gonna start reading in verse one.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.320]   If you don't have a copy of your Bible, it's fine.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.200]   I'm gonna read it out loud.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.960]   So just listen and we'll make it.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.380]   So Genesis 24, starting in verse one, says this.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.840]   "Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.760]   "and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.440]   "And Abraham said to his servant,
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.120]   "the oldest of his household,
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.200]   "who had charge of all that he had,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.240]   "put your hand under my thigh,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.100]   "that I may make you swear by the Lord,
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.800]   "the God of heaven and the God of earth,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.400]   "that you will not take a wife from my son
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.520]   "from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.960]   "But you will go to my country and to my kindred
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.160]   "and take a wife from my son, Isaac.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.000]   "The servant said to him,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.380]   "perhaps a woman may not be willing to follow me
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.280]   "to this land.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.600]   "Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.720]   "And Abraham said to it,
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   "see to it that you do not take my son back there.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.180]   "The Lord, the God of heaven,
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.880]   "who took me from my father's house
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.520]   "and from the land of my kindred,
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.460]   "who spoke to me and swore to me,
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.380]   "to your offspring I will give this land.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.280]   "He will send his angel before you
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.060]   "and you shall take a wife from my son from there.
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.980]   "But if the woman's not willing to follow you,
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.740]   "then you will be free from this oath of mine.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.120]   "Only you must not take my son back there.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.100]   "So the servant put his hand
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.800]   "under the thigh of Abraham, his master,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.120]   "and swore to him concerning this matter.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.180]   "Then the servant took 10 of his master's camels
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.460]   "and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.300]   "from his master.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.200]   "And he arose and went to Mesopotamia,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.120]   "to the city of Nahor.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.380]   "And he made the camels kneel down outside the city
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.780]   "by the well of water at the time of evening."
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.260]   The time when women go out to draw water.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.500]   "And he said, 'O Lord, God of my master Abraham,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.460]   "'please grant me success today
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.080]   "'and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.440]   "'Behold, I am standing by the spring of water
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.000]   "'and the daughters of the men of the city
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.600]   "'are coming to draw water.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.660]   "'Let the young woman to whom I shall say,
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.740]   "'please lay down your jar that I may drink.

[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.260]   "'and I will water your camels.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.460]   "'Let her be the one whom you've appointed

[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.640]   "'steadfast love to my master.'
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.600]   "And before he had finished speaking,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.700]   "behold, Rebecca, who was born of Bethuel,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.420]   "the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,

[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.700]   "and filled her jar and came up.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.440]   "Then the servant ran to meet her and he said,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.320]   "'Please give me a little water to drink from your jar.'
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.940]   "And she said, 'Drink, my lord.'
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.000]   "She quickly let down her jar upon her hand
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.340]   "and gave him a drink.

[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.860]   "and she drew for all his camels.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.720]   "And the man gazed at her in silence
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.780]   "to learn whether the lord had prospered his journey or not.
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.080]   "And when the camels had finished drinking,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.980]   "the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.680]   "and two bracelets for her arms weighing 10 gold shekels
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   "and said, 'Please tell me whose daughter you are.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.760]   "'Is there room in your father's house
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.440]   "'for us to spend the night?'
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.580]   "And she said to him, 'I'm the daughter of Bethuel,
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.500]   "'the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.'
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.980]   "She said, 'We have plenty of both straw and fodder
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.940]   "'and room to spend the night.'
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.200]   "And the man bowed his head and worshipped the lord
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.420]   "and said, 'Blessed be the lord,
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.100]   "'the God of my master Abraham,
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.340]   "'who has not forsaken his steadfast love
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.380]   "'and his faithfulness towards my master.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.180]   "'As for me, the lord has led me
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.140]   "'in the way to the house of my master's kinsmen.'
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.260]   "Then the young woman ran and told her mother's household
[00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.460]   "about these things."
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.700]   Well, Lord, I pray for us now and say, by your grace,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.160]   would you help us understand what is happening
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.960]   in this passage and what it means for us right now
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.640]   in these days in Dallas.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.640]   God, I pray that you would open our minds to understand it
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.680]   and you'd move our hearts to care about
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.780]   what you care about.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.100]   We sang some bold things, God,
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.820]   about revival coming to this city.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.380]   Lord, I pray it would start right here
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.580]   and start within individual hearts tonight.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.020]   And I just wanna invite you, family,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.340]   if you're willing, for you to take a minute
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.300]   and pray and ask him, say, "Lord, please teach me tonight."
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:05.340]   And then if you would, please pray for me,
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.980]   that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.320]   (silence)
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.200]   Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.880]   Use this time and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.080]   Well, one time when I was in college at Texas A&M,
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.680]   farmer's fight, he can go,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.820]   on a spring break, some buddies of mine and I
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.480]   decided to go down to San Miguel de Allende,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.560]   which is a little town about an hour north of Mexico City.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.200]   And so we jumped on a bus in Nuevo Laredo
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.620]   and rode through the night through Mexico
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.380]   and then woke up as the sun rose
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.260]   on this little artist colony town.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.460]   And I remember one of our first nights there,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.580]   we got up on the roof of La Perroquia,
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.220]   this massive neo-Gothic cathedral
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.260]   that kind of dominates this city.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.060]   And we were sitting on the roof of this beautiful cathedral
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.940]   watching the sun set and a men's choir
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.900]   was down in like the cavernous hallways of this church.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.900]   They began to sing hymns in Latin.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.680]   And I remember that moment because it stood out
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.920]   as a first for me that in that moment
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.360]   and this beautiful building as the sun was setting
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.960]   over this brightly colored town,
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.120]   listening to this music waft up,
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.120]   I was overcome with so much beauty, it made my heartache.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.200]   And I felt that in a moment
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   and I remember the thought springing to my mind,
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   I wish I had someone to share this with.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.240]   And then I looked over at my buddy Ricardo
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.900]   and I thought, that's not what I meant.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:41.060]   Ricky's a good dude, but I was feeling romantic.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.620]   And that was new for me 'cause I didn't always feel that way.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.340]   I didn't assume God would give me a wife
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.420]   or I'd get married.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.260]   And yet in that moment, I just felt this,
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.020]   man, I wanna be with someone.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.260]   I wanna share this life with somebody.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.380]   And let me tell you something,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.140]   that desire and that longing, it's good.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.580]   It's a holy thing.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.360]   It's a Genesis two thing.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.980]   As God was creating humanity, Adam saw around
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.300]   and the first not good from God was Adam alone.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.180]   It was cool to hang with the moose and the monkeys,
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.700]   but he wanted someone like him,
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.540]   a co-heir in the grace of life.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.340]   And so when he saw Eve, he said, at last,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.520]   finally, this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.180]   This is one like me that I can journey with
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.300]   through the complexities of life.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.020]   That desire to pair off is good.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.440]   And I remember for me that next morning,
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.140]   I woke up and as I walked through the marketplace
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.580]   of that city, I saw a lithograph by Gustav Dore.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.740]   It was a picture of a young man
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.180]   helping a woman down from a camel.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.980]   And at the bottom of it, it said,
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.020]   Isaac, recibe a Rebecca.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.820]   And so I accessed my two semesters of high school Spanish.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:50.900]   [audience laughing]
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.140]   And I said, I know what that says.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.800]   That says, Isaac receives Rebecca.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.340]   And God was giving me a vision, I think in that day,
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:03.540]   of what is the longest chapter in the book of Genesis.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.420]   God showing us the desire to pair off is good
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.260]   and then showing us how to do it, right?
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.740]   But let me say this, it has gotten complicated.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.500]   And Kylan's been speaking to that.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.140]   It's complicated to pair off in the modern world.
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.940]   Our church in Washington, DC,
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.760]   two thirds of our church are under the age of 30.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.060]   Two thirds of our church are single.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.980]   So I watched the difficulties and the longings
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.980]   and the complications every single day.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.660]   And there's reasons for this.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.040]   And we could go into all the reasons
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.700]   why dating and pairing off and marrying
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.140]   has gotten more complicated.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.420]   You've talked about many of them.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.900]   The technological changes during your lifetime
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.580]   have made it more difficult.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.580]   And we've seen the data, it's in.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.980]   More technology has led to less time
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.260]   hanging out with friends.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.700]   Less time hanging out with friends
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.220]   led to less social interactions,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.380]   less dates, less marriages, less kids.
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.020]   And now we have declining birth rates
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.180]   in nations all around the world.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.980]   We could talk about the philosophical changes.
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.340]   That there are books coming out now from secular authors
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.220]   saying the sexual revolution of the '60s and '70s
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.240]   that was meant to liberate sexuality
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.460]   from the bonds of marriage
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.700]   has not liberated women and made them happy.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.340]   It's made them miserable and feeling trapped.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.740]   That some philosophical lies in the culture
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.420]   that have landed on your generation
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.580]   have hurt you, not helped you.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.480]   And so we could talk about all the problems
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.940]   that have made it so hard for us to pair off,
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.660]   do this thing we desire to do.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.260]   But if I spent all my time doing that,
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.100]   we wouldn't get to a solution.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.940]   I remember for me, when I first moved to DC,
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.540]   I went to the Capitol and I listened
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.620]   to this amazing message this guy was telling us.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.300]   Everything wrong with American society
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.420]   and why it's falling apart.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.180]   And then as he enlisted all these problems,
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.540]   he ran out of time and then he left.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.060]   And I remember at the end I was like,
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.780]   is there an answer?
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.500]   Was that a diagnosis or an autopsy of how we died?
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.700]   Like, what's happening?
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.100]   So I could stand up here and read you the data on you
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.660]   and what's the matter with this world today?
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.620]   But let me tell you something.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.300]   I would rather move us towards focusing on a way forward
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.340]   because the good news is there is one.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.340]   And the good news is I officiated four weddings
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.180]   in a month this spring, right?
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.500]   A personal record for me.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.740]   So people are finding a way to pair off even in these days.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.920]   So I wanna talk about dating.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.200]   And in different cultures, at different times in histories,
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.740]   that process of evaluating and pairing off with people
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.020]   has been varied.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.380]   The dominant form of evaluating potential spouse today
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.900]   in this world is dating.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.380]   And I just wanna say this about dating.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.020]   Dating is a process you move through,
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.960]   not a status you sit in.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.420]   Dating is meant to be a process by which you evaluate
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.540]   whether me and this other person are meant to link hands
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.020]   and run for a lifetime.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.020]   It is not a status you sit in.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.180]   Well, I guess we're dating now
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.880]   and then linger there for years.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.820]   Mark Ragnaris at the University of Texas
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.100]   has done a ton of research about your generation,
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.820]   what he calls serial monogamy.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.860]   Just hanging out in an amorphous dating experience.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.540]   He says in survey after survey,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.940]   all it leads people to is much drama
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.060]   and in the end, mixed memories and wasted time.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.020]   That we're not meant to dwell in dating
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.260]   any longer than we must.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.020]   It is a process to move through, not a status to sit in.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.580]   And it's meant to move towards marriage.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.500]   Am I meant to bind myself with you
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.220]   until death do us part as we run this race together?
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.340]   And so I wanna talk about it,
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.620]   but I know some of you might be saying,
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.460]   well, wait a minute, Ben,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.420]   the Bible doesn't talk about dating.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.740]   And that's true.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.980]   As Greg Mott used to say,
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.380]   there's no passage that says,
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.740]   and Moses took Zipporah into Chili's
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.740]   and they had a great time.
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.100]   Like it's not in there.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.080]   So how are you gonna preach dating from the Bible?
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.020]   Well, the Bible doesn't talk about dating per se,
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.620]   but it does have much to say about evaluation.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.080]   You look at the book of Proverbs,
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:41.420]   which was written to young men.
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.580]   Proverbs 25 says,
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.740]   "It's better to live on the corner of a roof
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.100]   "than in a house with a contentious woman."
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.340]   That wasn't written to the married guy,
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.460]   hanging from his roof going,
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.300]   "No, you tell me."
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.740]   It's like, no, it was written to the single guy
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.340]   to say, "Watch that girl.
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.180]   "She always have drama.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.400]   "Her and her roommates always fighting.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.960]   "Well, don't link up with her forever
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.460]   "because you'll never have peace in your home."
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.300]   Proverbs 25 says,
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.840]   "A man without self-control is like a city broken into
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.700]   "and left without walls."
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.060]   Is that guy given to fits of rage?
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.420]   He's always bowing up on people.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.340]   Can he not control his own impulses?
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.340]   Does he say, "I'm struggling."
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.020]   And what that means is he's always being defeated.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.900]   If that's the case, if he has no self-control,
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.860]   you be careful, your home will never feel safe.
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.980]   And so the Bible has much to say about how to evaluate
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.380]   how we pair off with somebody else.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.860]   And we can debate whether or not dating
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.040]   is frankly the best way to do that,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.660]   but I'd rather just focus on the principles
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.980]   laid out in scripture that will help us properly evaluate
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.060]   whether or not somebody is a good fit.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.140]   And so I could give you a list of principles,
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.540]   but really what I wanted to do today,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.700]   why I just want to take a different path,
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.660]   I want to show us this story.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.460]   I think this image can capture our imagination.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.040]   And I'm going to go fast and I'm already talking fast,
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.260]   but let me tell you why.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.300]   I don't want you to think fast equals flippant.
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.700]   I'm going to move through some weighty issues of the heart,
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.340]   but I just want to get as much out to you as I can.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.740]   Because if you look at the book of Genesis,
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.940]   Genesis moves with stunning brevity
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.580]   through amazing moments in the history of creation.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.200]   You see the creation of the world, the creation of humanity.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.220]   You see the fall where evil came from
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.180]   and how it's dealt with.
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.940]   You see society form, you see God judge evil
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.060]   and then resurrect humanity from its ashes.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.540]   You've seen God move all these massive planks.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.440]   And then suddenly in Genesis chapter 12,
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.540]   the narrative slows down.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.580]   And rather than going through these big epics in history,
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.580]   it zooms in on one man, Abraham and his wife and their kids.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.780]   And God says to Abraham,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.340]   "I want you to move away from your father's house
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.440]   "and everything you know.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.980]   "I'm going to put you on a piece of real estate
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.820]   "that matters to me.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.800]   "I'll tell you why later.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.660]   "And there I'm going to give you a seed offspring
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.660]   "and your seed will bless the whole world."
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.500]   When humanity broke in Genesis three,
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.180]   God's promise to us was the seed of the woman
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.540]   will crush the serpent's head.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.900]   A boy is coming that's going to wreck shop
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.860]   on the one who deceived us
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.020]   and broke the way humanity relates to one another.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.360]   And God tells Abraham,
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.240]   "You're going to have a seed that blesses the world.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.520]   "Move to this piece of land.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.760]   "I'm going to give you a seed
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.420]   "and he will bless every family on earth."
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.420]   Abraham does it.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.220]   He's moved, he's had a full life.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.300]   And now there's just one thing that remains.
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.420]   Abraham needs his son to get married
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.980]   so that his lineage can continue.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.020]   And so the way they're going to do this,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.600]   I don't know if you caught it as I was reading it,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.540]   their process of pairing off was different.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.560]   It's more like a arranged marriage.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.460]   And I'm not going to advocate for arranged marriage tonight.
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.700]   But some of the guiding principles,
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.020]   I think will apply to us.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.660]   And then I think we'll get some good practices
[00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.500]   along the way.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.320]   Amen?
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.160]   So let's move through it together.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.980]   Verse one.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.500]   So we arrive at our text.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.860]   Things are looking pretty good for Abraham.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.300]   It says, "Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.660]   "and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things."
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.500]   That sounds like a great place to end a story,
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.100]   not start one.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.340]   But in verse two, "Abraham said to his servant,
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.600]   "the oldest of his household,
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.180]   "who had charge of all that he had,
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.300]   "put your hand under my thigh,
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.100]   "that I may make you swear by the Lord,
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.660]   "the God of heaven and the God of earth."
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.060]   Now stop right there.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.380]   Before we even look at what he's going to make him swear,
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.480]   notice the author wants us to see
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.720]   something of incredible significance is happening here.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.840]   And he lets us see it in three ways.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.560]   Number one, Abraham doesn't just call for a servant,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.860]   he calls for his most loyal and proven employee.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.480]   The guy who's been through it all and now manages it all.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.840]   I need that guy.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.560]   And then he brings that guy and makes him swear an oath
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.940]   by the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.840]   You don't make a guy do that
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.280]   in order to just pay the light bill.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.840]   You know, whatever he's about to say is critical information.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.080]   And then he tells him,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.040]   "Put your hand under my thigh as you swear this."
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.040]   Now commentators all agree, and I'll quote,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.560]   "That under my thigh is a euphemism that means
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.320]   "take the man's reproductive parts into your hand."
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.000]   Which some of you go, "Uh, what?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.360]   "Why would he do that?"
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.800]   Don't really have time to go into it.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.240]   We can spend a lot of time talking about it.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.920]   Happens a couple times in the Bible.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.740]   The point is, it's a very serious oath.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.640]   You don't do that all the time.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.080]   Why does he do it here?
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.280]   Well, again, we can go into details,
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.040]   but when God promised Abraham, "Through your seed,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.040]   "I'll bless the whole world,"
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.840]   God gave him the symbol of circumcision.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.160]   It's through your seed that I will bring the one
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.960]   who will crush the serpent's head and bring peace.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.200]   And so when he tells him that,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.280]   this symbol, this imagery is about posterity.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.720]   The hope of the world is coming here.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.320]   So swear to me, by the promise given to me by God,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.160]   that you'll do what I'm about to ask you to do.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.860]   And I mention that, even though it's a little weird,
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.000]   to just make this point.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.280]   God takes marriage really, really seriously.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.000]   This is the longest chapter in Genesis.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.520]   Why?
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.760]   God is showing us how he'll provide for Isaac,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.160]   but I think it's meant to be an encouragement to you.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.780]   God cares about your love life.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.480]   I think for some people,
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.240]   when they feel that longing so intensely,
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.960]   they feel embarrassed by it.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.080]   I shouldn't want so badly to pair off.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.960]   And I'm just letting you know, God cares.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.540]   It's a serious issue to him.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.380]   It matters.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:14.240]   Specifically, who you marry matters.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.220]   And so notice the oath Abraham makes him swear in verse three.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.620]   Swear that you will not take a wife for my son
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.340]   from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell,
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.660]   but you'll go to my country to my kindred
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.500]   and take a wife for my son, Isaac.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.220]   Now what's going on here?
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.900]   Is Abraham racist?
[00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.100]   Can't marry a Canaanite?
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.420]   It's not about ethnicity.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   It's about allegiance.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.260]   In the scriptures,
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.120]   people marry across ethnic lines all the time.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.800]   Moses did it, Ruth did it.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.220]   It's not about ethnicity.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.680]   The Canaanites believed in multiple gods
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.440]   and their worship of them was surrounded
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.440]   by violence and sexual exploitation.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.380]   Completely at odds with Abraham's commitment
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.080]   to a God of grace and truth.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.800]   So as he's thinking about who he wants his boy to marry,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.480]   he says, you know what?
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.040]   My family in the old country, they're not perfect,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.360]   but they have an allegiance to the one true God.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   And thus Abraham says, his first and really only criteria
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.660]   for a wife for his son is she must be a woman of faith.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.880]   She must believe in the one true God.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.000]   That's your first point,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.060]   that you wanna marry a man or woman of faith.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.680]   For the Christian, our love is meant to overflow
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.080]   expected banks in the culture and go everywhere.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.040]   Jesus told us to love our enemies.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.320]   We're supposed to love everybody.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.100]   But when you talk about your inner ring,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.000]   the person you bind yourself together with,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.280]   you want it to be a person
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.760]   who has the same allegiance you do in life.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.040]   You want a person who's walking by faith
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.720]   in the God you love.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.040]   Paul told Timothy, flee youthful lust,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.080]   pursue righteousness, love, joy, and peace,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.280]   along with those who call out to God out of a pure heart.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.120]   You wanna run together with someone
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.840]   who's moving the same direction as you.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.560]   You think about why people get divorced.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.300]   What's the most common thing they say?
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.800]   Our lives went different directions.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.560]   What do they mean by that?
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.840]   They don't mean, well, I'm a lawyer and she's a librarian.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.680]   What do they have in common?
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.700]   They're not talking about career.
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.380]   They're talking about in values.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.800]   In the biggest issues in life, we value life differently
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.360]   because here's the reality.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.500]   Whatever you think is most valuable in the world
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.240]   will shape your values.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.340]   And your values will shape your decisions
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.160]   and your decisions shape your life.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.360]   And so when you are gonna build a life with someone,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.600]   make sure you are lockstep on the biggest issues in life.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.640]   And yet I'll talk to some young people, go like,
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.760]   well, I mean, technically he's a monotheist.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.800]   Okay.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.260]   Some variety's good.
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.380]   He likes CrossFit, you like Pilates, that's fine.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.700]   But in the biggest issues in life,
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.720]   what do I think ultimate reality is
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.120]   and why do I think we're all here?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.080]   You don't wanna go, what's the bare minimum
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.260]   I can settle for?
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.840]   I remember hearing Tommy Nelson say it
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.680]   to a room like this years ago.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.240]   He said, "The loneliness of being single
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.900]   "is not assuaged by the loneliness you'll feel
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.440]   "in a king-sized bed laying next to a man
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.480]   "who cannot speak with you about the deepest things in life."
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.160]   You don't compromise here, don't settle here.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.400]   But notice it's not just marry a believer in God.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.680]   The servant responds with a question.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.960]   In verse five, the servant says,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.180]   "Perhaps the woman may not be willing
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.640]   "to follow me to this land.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.000]   "Must I then take your son back
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.760]   "to the land from which you came?
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.080]   "That seems like a reasonable request.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.040]   "Hey, if she's not willing to take this trip back,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.840]   "can I resettle the boy in the old country?"
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.000]   You know, let her be near her family,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.440]   let her continue her career, be supportive,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.680]   that sort of thing.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.000]   And it gets a strong reaction from Abraham.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.160]   In verse six, Abraham says, "See to it
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.240]   "you do not take my son back there."
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.120]   The NAS translates it, "Beware you take my son back there."
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.200]   What's Abraham's deal?
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.000]   Is he a chauvinist?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.160]   Why does he say that?
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.480]   Verse seven, "The Lord, the God of heaven,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.400]   "who took me from my father's house,
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.900]   "from the land of my kindred,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.200]   "and who spoke to me and who swore to me,
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.440]   "saying to your offspring, I'll give this land.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.040]   "He will send his angel before you
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.000]   "and you shall take away from my son there."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.760]   Why is he so serious about this?
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.160]   Because Abraham doesn't have this.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.520]   We're here in the story.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   He doesn't have the whole scripture to read,
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.280]   but he had a profound encounter with God in Genesis 12
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.600]   that was reaffirmed by a covenant in Genesis 15.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.360]   He had two directives, move to this land
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.680]   and you will have offspring,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.480]   and that offspring will bless the whole world
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.120]   from this strategic piece of real estate,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.360]   which is really the only land bridge
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.540]   between three major continents.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.840]   We don't have time to get into all that,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.600]   but God says, "I want you right there
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.120]   "when you have your seed that will bless the world."
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.720]   And Abraham says, "I got two commands from the king.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.140]   "Be here, have a kid, I'm doing that.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.200]   "And so no, the boy can't leave."
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.440]   And it's not because I'm not supportive of who this girl is,
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.160]   it's because God told us to move by faith.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.600]   And so you don't just wanna marry someone of faith,
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.440]   you wanna marry someone who is moving by faith,
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.840]   walking by faith.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.920]   My allegiance to God affects the decisions I make.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.400]   Beware that you go back.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.000]   God called us to the cutting edge of faith,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.980]   and if this girl won't go with us, then she's not the one.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.280]   What kind of woman would not be willing to go with him?
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.160]   Some of you ladies may say, "A prudent one."
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.720]   I mean, like, she doesn't even know these people.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.960]   But back then, this would have been a good arrangement.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.560]   These weren't strangers, they knew these people,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.540]   this would have been fitting with the culture of the day.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.920]   The woman who would have said, "I don't wanna go with you,"
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.440]   is one who says, "I don't wanna live by faith like you do.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.700]   "I'll attend church with you a little bit,
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.880]   "I'll believe there's a God up there,
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.920]   "but I don't want it to shape my decisions.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.120]   "I don't wanna give away my money."
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.200]   Says, "No, she has to live on the cutting edge of faith.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.200]   "We sold everything and moved with God,
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.760]   "and I wanna be linked up with someone like that."
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.200]   I remember I had a buddy years ago,
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.500]   he agreed to run a marathon with a coworker.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.680]   And so he was passionate about it,
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   and so he started to train every day.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.640]   She did not.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.800]   And so when they got to the marathon,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.440]   he was just running at their agreed upon pace,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.640]   and she was struggling keeping up.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.000]   But then she didn't want him to leave, stay with me.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.360]   And he was so mad, 'cause he said,
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.960]   "I had a passion to do this, and I had a pace,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.200]   "and now you're holding me back."
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.720]   For me, I ran one marathon in life,
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.760]   and I did it with my sister,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.160]   'cause she asked me to and I love her.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   And we trained every single day, every step together,
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.760]   and so when it came time to run the race,
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.240]   we were lockstep together, just moving together,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   laughing, talking, accelerating, why?
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.660]   'Cause we had the same passion, the same pace,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.640]   moving together, and that's how you wanna do marriage.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.600]   You don't wanna compromise here.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.740]   Anybody can say they're a Christian.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.940]   I had a friend in college get sexually assaulted
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.240]   on our first date by a guy who had a Bible
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.840]   on his coffee table and an Ixhus on the back of his car,
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.760]   a Christian bumper sticker.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.880]   I had a country friend who used to say it this way,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.000]   "You can put a bow tie on a turd,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.680]   "but it's still a turd."
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   So I don't care what someone calls themselves.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.560]   Yeah, I believe in God.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.400]   Yeah, I'm a Christian.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.880]   I wanna watch your life, not just a person of faith,
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.960]   but someone who moves by faith,
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.520]   that my allegiance to God affects my direction,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.680]   because you wanna say, "I'm following the king.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.220]   "I live for him, and I wanna run after him,
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.660]   "and I want the person next to me
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.120]   "to be running lockstep in stride together."
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.960]   That's what you want.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.660]   You want someone that you're sprinting along
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.340]   with a second engine to the car,
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.300]   not someone you're dragging behind, do you see it?
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.400]   For me and Donna, that's what I was looking for,
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.460]   a woman who wanted to run after God as hard as I did.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.300]   And let me tell you something,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.700]   your marriage will be strongest
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.500]   when it's on mission together, okay?
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.100]   Maybe not the same vocation,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.500]   but same direction, same passion, do you see it?
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.520]   Now, as soon as I say that, I know some of you go,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.040]   "Yeah, Ben, that's why we're here.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.020]   "That's what we want."
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.620]   And it's easy for you to say that,
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.180]   but what are the odds I'm gonna find someone like that?
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.540]   The good ones are all gone.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.900]   Look at Abraham's mentality in verse seven.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.860]   The Lord, the God of heaven,
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.820]   who took me from my father's house,
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.480]   from the land of my kindred,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.660]   who spoke to me and swore to me,
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.340]   "To your offspring I'll give this land.
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.220]   "He will send his angel before you,
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.180]   "and you shall take a wife for my son from there."
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.660]   What's Abraham's perspective?
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.140]   If I've trusted God with my life,
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.600]   I can trust God with my love life, right?
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.960]   He's a man of faith.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.900]   So you don't just wanna marry someone of faith,
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.060]   you wanna enter into this process as a person of faith.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.820]   If I've trusted Jesus with my eternal state,
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.420]   then I can trust him with my Friday night.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.660]   And I meet a lot of people that say,
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.540]   "Oh yeah, my heart belongs to Jesus."
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.460]   But when it comes to dating,
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.820]   suddenly it gets weird.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.380]   I gotta dress a certain way and act a certain way
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.380]   to land, bag, trick, get some person
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.380]   because it's just me out here
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.220]   and I gotta figure this out.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.180]   And you go, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.500]   "Desperation is a bad look for everybody."
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.320]   And so I gotta say,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.020]   "Man, if I trust God with my eternal destiny,
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:02.700]   "then I'll trust him with my destiny on Friday night."
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.900]   I wanna be someone who's living by faith
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.360]   in the way I move into a dating circle, right?
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.960]   You wanna walk into a date
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.900]   with the quiet confidence of knowing
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.920]   God determines my steps.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.420]   I can be me and a good version of you.
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.560]   I mean, bathe.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.520]   But I'm not there trying to convince somebody
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.020]   that we're meant to be together.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.500]   I'm walking with God by faith
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.540]   and I'm just evaluating,
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.180]   are we meant to run together as we seek him?
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.020]   Do you see it?
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.620]   And then Abraham's final words to his servants
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.900]   are in verse eight.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.100]   "But if the woman's not willing to follow you,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.040]   "you'll be free from this oath of mine,
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.140]   "only you must not take my son back there."
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.660]   Notice his perspective.
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.020]   Hey, if this doesn't work, I'm willing to let it go.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.940]   If she won't walk by faith,
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.700]   then you come home empty handed.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.560]   But I'd rather my son be single
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.400]   than settle for second best.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.780]   Don't compromise.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.540]   Don't get scared and settle.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.660]   So the servant put his hand under his thigh
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.780]   of Abraham, his master,
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.700]   and swore to him concerning this matter.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.860]   Then the servant took 10 of his master's camels
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.700]   and departed,
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.700]   taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.380]   and he rose and went to Mesopotamia
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.620]   to the city of Nahor.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.380]   All right, so the servant's journey begins.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.540]   Will he be successful?
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.620]   As we round the corner here,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.900]   I wanna move from just general guiding principles
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.140]   to some practical advice, okay?
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.220]   And so here's the first practical advice
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.340]   we're gonna get from the servant
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.660]   as he's searching for the one.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.240]   Look in the right place.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.080]   Look in the right place.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.900]   Notice it says he travels to the city of Nahor.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.060]   Nahor is not the name of the city.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.900]   Nahor is the name of Abraham's brother,
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.980]   which seems intuitive.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.100]   If I'm going to find Abraham's kinsmen,
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.420]   let me go to the city that houses the kinsmen of Abraham.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.100]   Let me go where his relatives live.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.660]   Makes sense.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.200]   If I'm looking for someone,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.460]   let me go to their house.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.340]   If I'm looking for someone's kid,
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.920]   let me go to their house.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.700]   If I'm looking for a daughter of God,
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.020]   let me go to God's house.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.260]   If I wanna marry a child of God,
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.520]   go to God's house.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.080]   Show up where those people would be.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.820]   It seems like such an obvious point.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.200]   But I remember years ago,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.880]   I was invited to Dallas and spoke at this single thing.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.160]   It was packed out kind of like this.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.640]   And I did a survey in the room of all these people,
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.480]   what church you go to.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.200]   They were all going to the same church together.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.560]   And then I asked them where they're all primarily dating.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.360]   And their number one and number two choices
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.600]   were on apps and in bars.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.480]   I'm not gonna criticize apps.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.000]   I've done weddings with people who met on apps.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.780]   There's some values to them.
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.840]   There's some downsides, but there is some values to it.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.880]   And you can meet wonderful people at the bar.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.440]   I'm not saying you can't do that either.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.320]   But I'm just saying, think about the odds.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.120]   If you wanna marry a person of God,
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.440]   and I told that room of girls,
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.280]   'cause some of them were like,
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280]   yeah, we don't date the guys here.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.120]   I don't really know.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.080]   I was like, all right, just for a second.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.880]   I said, I'll give you.
[00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:00.360]   What if out of 100 guys,
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.220]   90 of them are just goobers?
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.440]   I mean, just, it's hopeless.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.280]   You're just like, like, just think about that.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.960]   I said, that's still 10 guys
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.760]   that you'd want your son to be like.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.520]   What are your odds at the bar?
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.360]   Are they better than that?
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.720]   I said, look, I don't know.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.480]   And I'm not saying you can't find people there,
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.360]   but I'm just saying for me,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.880]   like if I wanna find a Texan, I've met some in DC,
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.620]   but the percentage shot goes way up when I come to Texas.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.320]   And if you wanna meet someone that loves the Lord,
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.920]   go to the places where people who love the Lord hang out.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.120]   That's all I'm trying to say in this point.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.560]   It's not real complicated, okay?
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.080]   I remember we did our volunteer Christmas party.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.320]   And like I said, two thirds of our church
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.760]   are single and under 30.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   We had our volunteer Christmas party.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.520]   And I'll never forget, these two young men walked up to me
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.120]   and I had written a book on dating.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.760]   They're like, hey man, you wrote the book on dating.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.160]   How do we meet girls?
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.320]   And I looked over their shoulder
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.760]   at our four or 500 volunteers.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.080]   I was like, well, guys, I'll tell you where to start.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.440]   Stop talking to me.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.880]   I said, this isn't just, we've called them out.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.920]   We've called out not just girls that go to this church,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.960]   but are serving here,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.240]   actively involved in the business of God.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.320]   And we threw a party, they got dressed up,
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.120]   they look nice, they're wonderful people.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.480]   If you can't play ball on this field,
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.760]   70 degree weather, no wind, nice lush grass.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.440]   If you can't play ball here,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.280]   I don't know what else to do, man.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.520]   So he goes to the city of Nahor.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.760]   And some of you go, well, Ben, that's great.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.640]   You go, but Ben, I don't have any people
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.880]   in my social circle that wanna walk with God.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.640]   Move!
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:51.840]   This city was 500 miles away from where Isaac lived.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.200]   That was his willingness, right?
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.200]   That sometimes you've gotta walk 500 miles
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.800]   and sometimes you gotta walk 500 more
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.480]   just to be the man who walked 1,000 miles
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.160]   to fall down at a shore.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.000]   It's all right.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.120]   (congregation applauding)
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.200]   Get into a different crowd of people.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.680]   Just don't settle.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.000]   All right, so he arrives at the city,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.280]   but he's more specific than that.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.520]   Verse 11, he makes the camels kneel down outside the city
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.360]   by the well of water at the time of evening,
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.280]   the time when women go out to draw water.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.040]   That's tip number two, go where the women are.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.000]   But notice what kind of women.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.840]   Those who are providing for their family.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.600]   And that's important.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.440]   All through the Bible, godly women
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.880]   have been those who are willing to work hard.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.960]   I will see it in a moment in Rebecca.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.200]   Moses' wife was a shepherdess.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.740]   The Shulamite in Song of Solomon worked in the vineyard.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.360]   Ruth gleaned the fields.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.660]   A woman who's willing to work is a prize.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.240]   The high yield woman, the mighty woman, the righteous one,
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.160]   the warrior woman of Proverbs 31,
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.400]   it says she girds herself with strength.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.440]   She makes her arms strong.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.260]   She's not a passive woman.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.640]   She feeds her family, clothes them,
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:02.600]   conducts wise business.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.840]   She's buying and selling real estate,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.480]   invests, serves the needy.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.280]   She's not an idle and weak person in Proverbs 31.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.860]   You want a girl like this.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.520]   I know when I was single,
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.040]   I was the last one of my friends to get married,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.160]   but I remember in that moment
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.480]   as I dwelled longer in singleness,
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.600]   like some of you maybe feel,
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.360]   I'm dwelling in a long time, I said, you know what?
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.640]   But I want a girl that I'm gonna meet
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.300]   in the midst of the work.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.680]   I'm running hard after God.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.080]   I wanna make a difference with my life,
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.120]   and I wanna make a girl on the mission field.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.800]   I wanna meet a girl that's working like that.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   And so you want somebody like that.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.640]   And when I met Donna,
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.240]   she was involved in a church serving,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.460]   discipling young girls.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.880]   She had worked at a barbecue restaurant.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.300]   She had calloused hands.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.280]   Amen.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.040]   Let me apply this in two ways.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.800]   You want an industrious person.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.140]   You don't wanna marry a lazy person, by the way.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.380]   They'll frustrate you to no end
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.800]   when it comes time to pay bills,
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.640]   earn a living, clean your house, et cetera, okay?
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.440]   And so ladies, take your cues from Rebecca.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.400]   Just decide to work hard.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.360]   Guys, take your cues from Isaac.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.820]   His servant rolls up with 10 camels, okay?
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.920]   That mean Isaac was paid, right?
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.960]   He had a job.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.260]   Now, I'm not saying you gotta be rich.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.080]   I'm just saying you gotta be employed, okay?
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.100]   So you get out there and hustle up and get some camels
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:18.840]   to show that you can be a productive human being in society.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.040]   The other thing I wanna say before we move on from this
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.080]   is you're gonna find the workers working.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.400]   I wanna find a worker, then find the workers working, right?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.280]   So if you wanna marry someone who's industrious
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.380]   in the things of God, that are doing things that matter,
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:33.780]   you might find them sitting next to you at church.
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.240]   You're probably more likely to find them
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.540]   serving in the nursery, serving on the greeting team,
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.400]   serving in a church capacity, serving here at the porch.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   If you wanna work with the workers,
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.320]   get working where they work.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.480]   You wanna fly with the flyers,
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.360]   go where flyers are flying, right?
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.680]   And so if you wanna be with somebody
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.960]   that's industrious and moving, get involved.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.320]   Get involved in your local church, get involved in serve,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.360]   get involved here at the porch, move.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.560]   And you'll find some people moving alongside of you
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.160]   and you'll run together, that's the idea.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.080]   And then notice what he does
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.480]   when he gets to his destination, verse 12.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.320]   It says, "And he prayed,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.680]   "'Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham,
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.560]   "'please grant me success today
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.440]   "'and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.'"
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.360]   That's your next tip.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.880]   He actively invites God into the process.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.480]   He hasn't initiated yet with a woman,
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:20.320]   but he gets there and he goes,
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.720]   "Okay, God, I need you to show up."
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.120]   In prayer, let me just tell you,
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   we don't have time to belabor this,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.720]   it takes the desperation out of dating.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.980]   Okay, there's a God over this who's guiding us.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.240]   There's a God over this who's worthy of our trust.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.120]   I don't need to rule out of anxiety.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.320]   I cast my cares upon him because he cares for me,
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.440]   the scripture says.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.040]   So I know he cares for me.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.960]   I can be settled in this moment.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   And so he prays, like Proverbs tells us,
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.320]   "In all your ways, acknowledge him
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.040]   "and he'll make your path straight.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.840]   "God, I invite you into this moment."
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.040]   It's something I pray all the time
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.200]   when I'm talking to people.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.660]   "God, I invite you into this moment.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.840]   "You're already here, but I just wanna acknowledge
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.060]   "your presence in this.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.240]   "Give me the grace in this moment
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.880]   "to be fully present with you, God,
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.480]   "as I talk to this person."
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.040]   I would pray that when I was single
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.080]   and walked into rooms like this.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.900]   I don't know if I'm here to encourage a friend,
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.680]   make a friend, or meet the one, I don't know.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.920]   But I know I wanna walk in saying,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.920]   "God, you're leading me and guide me where you have me go."
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.360]   And so he prays.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.180]   And in verse 13, we get the substance of the prayer.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.500]   "Behold, I'm standing by the spring of water.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.660]   "The daughters of the men of the city
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.660]   "are coming out to draw water.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.180]   "Let the woman to whom I shall say,
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:28.220]   "please let down your jar that I may drink.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.280]   "And who shall say, drink it, I'll water your camels.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.000]   "Let her be the one that you have appointed
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.080]   "for your servant Isaac.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.940]   "By this I shall know that you have shown
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.220]   "steadfast love to my master."
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.500]   Now, I can't affirm that it'll work out this way.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.460]   "Lord, let the one I'm sitting by at the porch
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.860]   "be the one I am meant to marry."
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.900]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.940]   I don't know.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.740]   But I want you to notice what criteria he's looking for.
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.620]   This is an old man.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.380]   He said, "I'm gonna approach as an old man
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.200]   "and ask for a drink of water.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.520]   "And I want her to be someone who will not only help me
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.840]   "and give me a drink,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.580]   "but will help me with all my animals too."
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.540]   He's looking for graciousness.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.420]   That's your next tip.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.820]   You wanna look for a gracious person.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.540]   Proverbs 11 says, "A gracious woman attains honor."
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.720]   This lady is gonna end up marrying an incredible guy.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.020]   How did he get there?
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.400]   How did she get there?
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.660]   She was kind.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.720]   She was hospitable.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.580]   I watched a fascinating phenomenon,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:29.980]   and this'll sound terrible, I know,
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.800]   but there was two social spheres I was in,
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.540]   one in high school and one in college,
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.100]   where there was a girl in each of those spheres
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.340]   that was, in both situations,
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:43.620]   middle of the pack in terms of attractiveness.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.300]   I know it's terrible, I told you it was gonna be.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.840]   But the most interesting social phenomenon would happen.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.020]   They would get asked out exponentially more
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.340]   than everyone else.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.840]   I mean, it was wild.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.240]   And you go, what was the common denominator?
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.180]   They were both so nice.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.960]   They were both so kind.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.100]   They were encouraging to people.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.980]   They would help out.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.540]   One of them was at a restaurant I worked at.
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.460]   She would help bus tables that weren't her tables.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.020]   You don't get paid for that.
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.380]   And she would just do it for everybody,
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.740]   not just one guy she liked.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.940]   She was just gracious.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.080]   And I would watch these guys get confused,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.460]   non-Christian guys, look at 'em and be like,
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.660]   I love you.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.340]   I mean, over time, some of us were like, all right, easy.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:23.380]   But we just watched it.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.340]   We had to defend her,
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.300]   because all these guys were attracted to that kindness.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.800]   And guys, it's the same with you.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.340]   Proverbs 19 says, "What's desirable in a man
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.860]   "is his kindness."
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.620]   I remember the first ministry I got involved in
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.460]   as a young man.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.580]   I got involved in this para-church organization,
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.980]   and I was in these Bible studies.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.580]   And after a while, I just made the observation
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.500]   that all the men that led 'em were homely-looking guys.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.060]   With beautiful wives.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.580]   And one after another, I'm like, this is a trend.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.480]   What is happening?
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.260]   And finally, I asked one of 'em.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.540]   I was like, hey, man, what is the deal?
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.780]   'Cause I'm looking at you.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.140]   Then I'm looking at her.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.260]   And I'll never forget, he goes, it's a great question.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.620]   It's one I've asked myself.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:08.380]   He said, I'll tell ya.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.820]   He said, I was in college,
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.940]   and this girl was so nice, so sweet, so kind, so amazing.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:14.460]   He said, I worked up all my courage,
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.580]   and asked her out on a date.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.420]   She said yes.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   I went back to my room, and was like, yes!
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.740]   And then he realized, that's as far
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:20.700]   as I had thought it through.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.260]   And so he got home, and he was like, oh no!
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.100]   Like, I don't know what to do!
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.340]   And he was freaking out, like, ah!
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.860]   I just, it took all of me to just get the courage to ask her.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.260]   She actually said yes, I'm freaking out, I got no plan.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.660]   And he literally went to his Bible, and was like,
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.500]   help me, Lord!
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.020]   And threw it open to Proverbs 19.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.580]   What's desirable in a man is his kindness.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.380]   And he said, I may get everything else wrong tonight,
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.380]   but I will be kind.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.780]   And they went on a date.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.060]   Fast forward, they're married, and he said,
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.860]   Ben, we were laying in bed one night,
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.780]   and I asked her the very question you just asked me.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.860]   How did this happen?
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:58.820]   And he said, she went, you were just so kind.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.420]   You were so kind.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.260]   And he went.
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:06.540]   Words.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.800]   So, he's looking for a woman that's kind.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.580]   Now notice the text says she's beautiful,
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.620]   bonus, didn't pray for that, that's nice.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.500]   And it mentions that she had never been with a man.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.300]   That means she was a virgin.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.340]   Let me say this about that.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.580]   This is a whole other sermon for another day.
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:28.660]   There's a value to sexual purity in the Bible.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.860]   Paul told the Thessalonians that you should abstain
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.420]   from sexual immorality, so you're not,
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.300]   you shouldn't wrong or defraud your brother in this way.
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.860]   That you go, you know what?
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:44.820]   Sexuality's a gift from God, meant to be confined
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.380]   within a boundary of I promise to love all of you,
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.840]   not just the part I wanna use.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.700]   And so here in the Bible, you see a value to sexuality
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.180]   to protect it, it's a gift, protect it.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.580]   Give your body to someone who wants all of you,
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.540]   wants to care about your heart, care about your feelings,
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.060]   care about your mind, you want someone who cares about you.
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.660]   Yet, I want you to notice, it was not a prerequisite
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.200]   of Abraham's, because it's not a prerequisite of God's.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.340]   In the New Testament, the church is called
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.220]   the Bride of Christ.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.820]   Jesus' bride did not come to him pristine.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.980]   Ephesians says he washed us by the water of his word.
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:29.340]   We all come to Jesus sexually broken, everybody does.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.860]   You look through the Bible, every time people rebelled
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.540]   against God, there was some sexual tragedy
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.040]   associated with their culture.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.920]   And yet, God says sex is a gift, I gave it to you,
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.980]   I want it to be protected within the boundaries
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.500]   that are for your human flourishing.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.620]   Paul told the Corinthians to take it outside of it
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.620]   is to sin against your own body.
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.780]   And let me just make the point,
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.480]   it messes up the evaluation process.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.200]   Sex is fun, God made it that way.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.860]   It releases oxytocin, which is a bonding agent in your mind,
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.620]   it releases dopamine, the happy chemical
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.440]   that says do that again.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.140]   But if you rush sexuality into the evaluation process
[00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.820]   of dating, you'll stay connected with someone
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.660]   for a long time before you even realize I can't trust them.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.540]   And so you're meant to hold that back
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.580]   to evaluate their character and y'all's chemistry.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.660]   And then when you say we are meant to be together
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.900]   until death do us part, then you enjoy the gift
[00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.460]   God gave us of sexuality.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.660]   But I want you to be clear and know that if you say,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.940]   hey, I'm here and I'm not sexually pristine,
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.140]   yeah, that's most everybody.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.900]   And it was not a prerequisite for a happy
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.780]   and godly marriage.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:36.460]   If you look through the Bible, the lineage of Jesus
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.660]   is filled with people with sexually devastated pasts.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.660]   Judah, Rahab, David, Bathsheba, not too far gone,
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.120]   graciously forgiven, wonderful marriages,
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.060]   a part of godly and great things.
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.860]   So you be encouraged, right?
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.340]   You see it?
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.580]   All right, a lot more we can say there,
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.580]   but I got to wrap up here.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.560]   All right, so all this servant knows right now
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.520]   is that she's hot and carrying a water jug.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.620]   Sometimes that's not a bad place to start.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.660]   He asked her for a drink, you know what happens.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.140]   She gives him one and she says,
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.540]   and I'll water for your camels.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.220]   And it says, he gazed in silence to learn
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.580]   whether the Lord had prospered his journey or not.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:16.100]   Watch and learn, watch them for a while.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.580]   That's one of the benefits of being in a social circle
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.860]   with people for a while, you just get to watch them.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.540]   Anyone can do good in an hour interview over dinner.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.520]   Charm is deceitful, beauty is vain, right?
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   But you just watch them in a social circle.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.100]   How do they treat old people?
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.740]   How do they treat young people?
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:34.820]   How do they treat people that won't serve
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.340]   some direct advantage for them financially or socially?
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.940]   That's how they'll treat you when you're not at your best.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.260]   Just watch and learn.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:45.500]   So he just watches her to learn, is this the one?
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.140]   When I first met Donna, she was leading worship on a stage.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.980]   And let me tell you something,
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.700]   that did not impress me at all.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.780]   Because there's enough benefit to being on a stage
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.140]   in front of people that you could be doing it
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.300]   for selfish and insecure and shallow reasons.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.740]   That's not sufficient for me, I had to watch her.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.980]   And I saw how she would disciple young girls,
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.500]   didn't get paid for that.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.440]   Did it 'cause she loved the Lord,
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.280]   loved her church and loved these girls.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.900]   I watched her serve selflessly over time.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.900]   I watched, this is a girl that doesn't just love God,
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.680]   she's being shaped in the image of God.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.640]   That's who I wanna be bound together with.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.180]   Because she'll love me when I'm at my best
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.780]   and I'm at my worst, right?
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.820]   And so let me tell you something,
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.940]   you wanna keep watching their character.
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:27.120]   A woman who fears the Lord is to be praised, you want that.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.940]   He asked her her name, she says she's from Nahor.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.300]   And we'll close with this, the man bowed his head,
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.620]   worshiped the Lord, blessed be the Lord,
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.020]   the God of my master Abraham,
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.060]   who's not forsaken his steadfast love
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.860]   and his faithfulness towards my master.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.420]   He asked who she is, who is this gracious,
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.660]   wonderful, kind woman?
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.860]   And she says, I'm the relative of Nahor.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.620]   And he went, oh my God, you did it.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.380]   I thought it was impossible, you did it.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.580]   And he worships.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   And let me tell you something, that's what you want.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.380]   You don't wanna settle for someone,
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.380]   you wanna worship at the grace of God
[00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.220]   to lead you to the right person.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.820]   I remember when I was in my 20s, I had a buddy
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:08.300]   that he said he wanted to ask this girl out
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.620]   that was so cute, sweet, and amazing.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.100]   And he said, but I'm scared.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:12.060]   And everyone was like, no, do it.
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:12.880]   And he goes, no, man.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.980]   And then he took like a batter's stance and he goes,
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.300]   this is how I feel.
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.380]   Now batting out of his league, Jinx Curry.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.900]   And I remember when he said that, we all laughed like,
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.820]   ah, that's funny.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:23.800]   And then one of the guys goes,
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.300]   but that's how you wanna feel.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.380]   He said, you don't wanna get married to a girl and go,
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:32.700]   you know, you were about the best I could pull off.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.340]   Slid in right about here.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.540]   He says, you wanna marry someone that you go,
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.580]   thank you, God, for leading me to a man like that,
[00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.140]   leading me to a woman like that.
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:46.020]   Thank you for leading me to a person like that.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.180]   I had been scared of marriage.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.500]   I waited a long time.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.080]   But when Donna and I finally figured out,
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.620]   this is the one, I remember driving from Dallas
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:59.340]   through the night up to Oklahoma to talk to her dad,
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.540]   through the night down to meet her mom at the sunrise
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.380]   the next morning.
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.620]   Saw the sunset and sunrise to go talk to her parents.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.060]   'Cause once I knew it was her, let's go.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.460]   And that whole drive across Texas,
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.580]   I remember at one point rolling the windows down
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.820]   and worshiping.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.340]   God, you did it.
[00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   Took me longer than everyone else I know.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.980]   Isaac was 40 in this passage.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.220]   Sometimes you gotta wait for your pitch.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.940]   But when it's the right one, you worship.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.260]   And that's what you're meant to do.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.940]   The woman is asked finally at the end,
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.420]   are you willing to go?
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.700]   That's the big moment.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.900]   The servant tells the whole story again.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.980]   Family wants the servant to stay.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:39.260]   And the servant says, hey, call the girl in.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.700]   And she says, I'll go.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.880]   She's a woman of faith.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.740]   And she goes.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.500]   She rides with the servant.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:47.700]   And it says in verse 62,
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.740]   now Isaac had returned from Beerlehai Roy
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.380]   and was dwelling in the Negev.
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.500]   And Isaac went out to meditate in the field towards evening.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.180]   He lifted up his eyes and saw,
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:58.580]   and behold, there were camels coming.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.260]   And Rebecca lifted up her eyes.
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.620]   And when she saw Isaac,
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.260]   she dismounted from her camel.
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.980]   And she said to the servant,
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.780]   who is that man?
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:10.080]   Walking in the field to meet us.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.480]   And the servant said, it's my master.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.020]   And she took her veil and covered herself.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.900]   And the servant told Isaac all the things he had done.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.240]   Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother,
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.380]   and took Rebecca and she became his wife.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.500]   And he loved her.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.340]   That's what she was.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.180]   But let me close with this.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.180]   This is a real story.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.100]   This is how the lineage of Jesus came together
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.740]   where he showed up.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.620]   But it's also a picture.
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:37.120]   It's a picture of what God is doing with you and me.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.900]   The father sends a servant
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:45.420]   to tell a potential mate, I have a son.
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.820]   A miraculous son.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.380]   Isaac was a miracle.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.720]   A miraculous son who was laid on the altar as a sacrifice.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:54.020]   That was Isaac.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.520]   And yet God brought him back.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.060]   He is the heir of all things.
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.740]   And he wants you.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.500]   He wants a relationship with you,
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.940]   a covenant of steadfast love.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.780]   And the question is, will you say yes?
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:08.780]   Will you go?
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.880]   And will you walk by faith to be his?
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.740]   What is being asked of her
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.300]   is what's being asked of you by God.
[00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.580]   God looks at us and says, I have a son.
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.760]   Miraculously born.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.120]   Laid on the altar as a sacrifice for you and me.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.520]   And now he's the heir of all things.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.520]   And he is coming to each one of us and saying,
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.280]   I want a relationship with you.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.960]   And let me encourage you as we close.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.640]   We went fast through all this.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.320]   But before you get a relationship
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.040]   with a guy or a girl right,
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.520]   you need to get a relationship with God right.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.120]   You need to know the love that crossed from heaven to earth
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.720]   and sacrificed for you.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   You need that love to change you from the inside out.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.660]   And then you link up with one of God's kids.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.820]   Enter into his family by faith in the son of God
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.460]   who has sent servants like TA and Kylan and me
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.980]   and so many others to tell you,
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.860]   there is a son of the king,
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:06.200]   an heir of all things who is a sacrifice for you.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.220]   Will you by faith walk with him?
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.060]   And I promise you, you'll be amazed at what God does
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.420]   as you walk with him by faith.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:14.820]   Uncertainty will abound, but he's good in it.
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.820]   And when he leads you, if it be his will to the right one,
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:18.980]   you'll rejoice.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:20.220]   Amen.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.340]   So father, thank you.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.660]   Thank you that you care.
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:26.980]   Thank you that you care about our hearts.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.220]   I pray for any in this space
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.900]   who's never put their faith in you, God.
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.500]   This would be the day that relationship gets right first.
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.420]   That there's forgiveness with you.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.260]   There's life with you.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.360]   There's hope with you.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:42.100]   And then God, I pray for us as we think about
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.100]   the longings in our heart to pair off.
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:48.360]   I pray some faith muscles might grow tonight.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:50.860]   And friend, I wanna encourage you.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.340]   Let's not make this just classroom, make it a lab.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.760]   Before you walk out of here,
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.000]   are you willing to trust God by faith?
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.500]   God, I wanna trust you with my eternal destiny.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.700]   I wanna walk with Jesus.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.100]   And God, I wanna trust you with my Friday night.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.820]   I'm not gonna compromise with someone that I know
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.980]   doesn't care about you.
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.780]   God, I don't wanna settle.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.900]   I wanna walk by faith.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.260]   I don't wanna walk with someone by faith.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.780]   I'm scared of the uncertainty,
[00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.020]   but I wanna live by faith.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.320]   Some of you just need to offer up to him
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.560]   your dating life, your desires,
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.500]   and say, God, I wanna take the next step
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.780]   to be someone who walks with purity and holiness and faith
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:35.500]   with a God who moved all of history to send his son
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:37.980]   and is moving me now to walk with him.
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.900]   Will you trust him?
