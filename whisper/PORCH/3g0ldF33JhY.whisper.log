[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:24.960]   Thank you, Josiah.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.400]   Was anybody here alive in 1950?
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.360]   OK, that's when I came on the scene.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.720]   I saw the porch.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.920]   I saw a watermark when it was just a gleam
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.560]   in the eye of a bunch of guys.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.840]   So this is a special delight from the prayers
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.960]   that went up for you before you were ever here.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.280]   I want to show you something, because we're about to start
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.560]   Ecclesiastes.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.000]   Is that right, Josiah?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.880]   Says you to me, we're going to start Ecclesiastes.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.280]   Could you teach something on this?
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.360]   I said, man, I wrote a book on this.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.440]   It's sold dozens of copies over these years.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.400]   Take a look in your Bible at the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.600]   or your computer machine, or your phone,
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.560]   or whatever you have there.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.920]   And so in Ecclesiastes chapter 1, in your Old Testament,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.000]   you've got the history from Genesis to Nehemiah.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.720]   And then after that, you've got the prophets
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.680]   from Isaiah to Malachi.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.840]   That's the beginning and end of your Old Testament.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.220]   And right in the middle, you have
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.080]   what are called the wisdom books.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.760]   Psalms, Proverbs, Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.440]   I forgot one.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.280]   Job.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.520]   All of those books are kind of the philosophy books.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.760]   They're called the poetry books, because they deal
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.560]   with the heart issues of life.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920]   What got them in trouble in the history books,
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.040]   what got them prophesied about in the prophets,
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.280]   that of man and sin in this world.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.720]   And so those five books right in the middle
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320]   they're kind of philosophy poetry books
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.560]   about the issue of living your life in a world that has fallen.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.400]   Let me ask you, can you torch your life real quickly
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.440]   by bad decisions?
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.560]   Yes, you can.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.760]   Or you can make it a joy.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.400]   You can build it on sand, build it on the rock, either way.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.040]   And so these books talk about the moral decisions.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.840]   It's almost like they say, here's
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.680]   what you should have done in the history
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.640]   so you won't end up like you're going to be in the prophets
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.920]   if you'd have done this.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.800]   So you stay with me right here.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.200]   Ecclesiastes.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.480]   Whenever you talk to people that are having a problem with God,
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.680]   the Bible, Christianity, it's usually
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.280]   because of four things.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.560]   They see a problem between God and reason.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.600]   The Trinity, the virgin birth, the death, burial, resurrection.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   That doesn't fit into my grid of what I've experienced.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.080]   Secondly, they'll have a problem between God and science.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.800]   Darwin says this.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.040]   This guy says this.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.520]   Stephen-- what's his name?
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.920]   Stephen Hawking.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.760]   He says this.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.400]   The Bible says this.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.520]   I got a problem with God and science.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.240]   Got a problem with God and the news.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.360]   Got a problem with God and national geographic.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.560]   Who do I believe?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.240]   And then they'll have a problem between scripture
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.680]   and scripture.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   Matthew says this, but Mark says it.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.400]   Luke says this.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.760]   John says this.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680]   Judges says this.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.600]   Joshua says this.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.960]   King says this.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.360]   Chronicles says this.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.280]   Whenever you get parallel accounts,
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.400]   they're never going to be identical.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.040]   They'll be not contradictory, but complementary.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.720]   And so they'll see those and demand
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.080]   of those which you would demand of no other works.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.840]   And so they'll have a problem with what they
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.560]   see as internal inconsistency.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.480]   And then the other problem is what Ecclesiastes is about.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.360]   And this is a problem with God and evil.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.840]   It's called theodicy.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.200]   Theodicae.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.760]   Dicae means judgment.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   Theo means God.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.480]   God under judgment.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.560]   It's when man calls God to the bar of human reason.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.360]   How many of you have ever had the experience
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.080]   or know somebody that's had it that will not entertain
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.680]   the notion of God because something so painful
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.560]   happened to them that they cannot figure,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.440]   how could a loving God dot, dot, dot?
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.520]   And it goes like that.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.200]   How could a loving God let my parents divorce?
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.320]   How could a loving God let my brother die of cerebral palsy?
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.480]   How could a loving God allow a Holocaust?
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.560]   How could-- and all of us have had things happen in our lives
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.400]   that we wondered where God was.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.720]   The psalmist reflects it.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.400]   Proverbs reflects it.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Job majored in it.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.720]   And so yeah, Ecclesiastes is about living
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.680]   in a world that is not the best of all possible worlds,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.400]   but it's on the way to the best of all possible worlds.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.200]   It's God and evil that we deal with.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   The first two chapters, the name God
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.280]   is only going to be mentioned in passing.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   We're going to look at what life is like under the sun.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.240]   We're not going to look at what God says about it.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.160]   We're not going to quote in the Old Testament.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.800]   We're just going to look at life down here under the sun
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.040]   and where we're going to find answers if God does not speak.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.680]   It's a very melancholy two chapters.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.960]   You want to hear it and go throw yourself off a bridge.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   OK.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.680]   But hang on.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.160]   All right.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   Are you with me so far?
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.000]   God under the sun.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.960]   How do I coexist in a world that has evil?
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.160]   He begins in verse 1, the words of--
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.440]   and it's a Hebrew word called the koheleth, the preacher.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   When you think of preacher, you think of the word
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.880]   of God being heralded.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.480]   He begins very optimistically.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.360]   I'm going to tell you something that is divine truth,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.880]   and it's going to carry you through life.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.480]   Now, I want to assure you what I'm going to teach you here
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.980]   and what Josiah is going to bring you
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.960]   for the next few weeks, you will apply it.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.680]   A lot of you are going to apply it before you even got here.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.320]   It's Ecclesiastes.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.640]   It's the koheleth, the preacher, the son
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.200]   of David King in Jerusalem.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.720]   That is Solomon.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.600]   Solomon is the richest guy that ever lived.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.200]   He is the most hedonistic guy that ever lived, 700 wives.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   Are you serious?
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.840]   He is the most intellectual man, called
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.720]   the wisest man of his day.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.280]   So if you have wisdom, you have money, you have pleasure,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.360]   you would think you've got it all.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.760]   God's going to take a guy.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.040]   Francis Schaeffer, the great theologian,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.320]   apologist said back in my day, he
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.640]   said God took Solomon, a guy with all the smarts,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.440]   all the money, all the pleasure, and he propels him
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.160]   to the end of the universe to see what
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   life is like without God.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.280]   And he comes back and says, if you've got wisdom,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.680]   you've got money, you've got pleasure, and you don't have
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.720]   God, you've got nothing.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.240]   You have got vanity, vanity, all is vanity.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.680]   Be encouraged, OK?
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.600]   Verse 2.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.200]   So let's see what Solomon found in his journey.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.080]   If some guy like me goes out and says
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.560]   there's no life without God, you're
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.160]   going to say, well, you ain't that smart,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.800]   you're not that rich, you ain't got that much hedone to enjoy.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.480]   Solomon can trump every one of us
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.520]   as far as money, wealth, and pleasure.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.560]   He's had it.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.680]   If he can't find it, you're not going to find it either.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.000]   So he says in verse 2, "Vanity of vanities."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.120]   Just like in Israel, you had the holy of holies.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.480]   Of all the holiness there was, this was the holy place.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.000]   "Vanity of vanities," says the preacher.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.360]   Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.080]   Incidentally, one of the first guys in the Bible
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.000]   is named Vanity.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.520]   Adam and Eve had a kid named Cain.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.760]   He didn't work out real well.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.320]   And we had a kid that took his place in the line that
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.760]   would produce Messiah.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.320]   And his name was Abel.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.920]   And that's what the word vanity is in Hebrew.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.120]   Abel.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.520]   Because she had a kid named Cain and named him
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.400]   begotten with the help of God.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.200]   This is the child that maybe is going
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.880]   to be the seed of woman that will crush the serpent's head.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.800]   And after he had been around a little while,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.040]   she named the next kid, you're a loser.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.280]   That's what it means.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.120]   All right.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.600]   Abel.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   It means vanity.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.920]   This kid ain't going to make it on his own.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.080]   And so in verse 3, or rather verse 2,
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.960]   he says, "Abel, Abel, all is Abel."
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.000]   In verse 3.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.360]   Now, he's going to explain what vanity means.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.600]   He doesn't mean that life is meaningless.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.200]   He means that life is, in verse 3,
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.120]   what advantage does man have in all of his work?
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.720]   It's the Hebrew word prophet, P-R-O-F-I-T.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.240]   What prophet?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.320]   When you die, Josiah, how much are you
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.680]   going to leave behind?
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.280]   Everything.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.480]   It's all gone.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.760]   No U-Hauls following a hearse.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.480]   All right.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.640]   You're going to leave it all.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.160]   Mark Twain, an agnostic, he said, "When man dies,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.360]   the world laments him for an hour and forgets him forever."
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.080]   You're gone.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.760]   It says that at the end of his life,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.560]   God bestows on him the only untainted gift
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.240]   he ever received, death.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.880]   Depressive guy, Mark Twain.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.240]   And so what prophet does a man have in all of his work,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.320]   which he has done?
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.920]   And he uses this term, under the sun.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.360]   It's Solomon's term about life.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.240]   We're not going to talk about God the creator making himself
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.920]   known through his word, whereby I might have new birth.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.080]   That's another sermon for another day.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.480]   We're talking here about the college scenario.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.360]   About have you all discovered that at college,
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.760]   they don't play Amazing Grace on the chimes?
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.200]   It's not a Christian place generally.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.360]   It's a place that is secular.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.280]   It's man trying to find his answers.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.840]   And so he says, what prophet does a man have under the sun?
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.720]   Life without the Bible, life without God,
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.360]   just a complete secular man.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.800]   And in verse four, he says, here's what prophet you have.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.360]   A generation goes, they die.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.200]   A generation comes.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.720]   The earth remains forever.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.760]   A guy is born.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.120]   He goes a number of years.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.200]   He dies.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.600]   But the earth keeps on going.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.200]   The world does not reward you.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.800]   The world life does not hit a climactic point
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.360]   that you find ultimate joy, peace, and nirvana.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.160]   You don't explode into space, like Stephen Will said
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.040]   in my day.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.080]   Anybody?
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.760]   OK.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.960]   And so he says, a generation is going to be born.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.360]   They're going to die.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.720]   And we're all going to grieve over you, wipe our eyes,
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.320]   then head off downtown, eat some Tex-Mex.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.400]   All right.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.440]   And you're done.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.800]   Welcome to the porch, OK?
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.320]   He says in verse five, in verse five, verse six, and verse
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.960]   seven, are wheels of the cosmos.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   There's always this tension between man,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.040]   a sentient being with knowledge and longings,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.760]   and a cosmos that is nothing more than animals that
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.120]   are hardwired and plants that have life cycles.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.200]   There's nothing to give us ultimate meaning.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.240]   And so in verse five, the sun rises, sun sets,
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.000]   hastening to its place.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.560]   It rises again.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.080]   Look at it.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   It's going.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.840]   Big pocket, pocket, pocket, pocket, pocket, pocket,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.360]   pocket.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.080]   The sun is rising and falling, and it keeps going.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.760]   It does not applaud you.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.040]   It does not reward you for anything that you do.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.280]   It just grinds you up.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.560]   And here in verse six, blowing to the south,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.640]   turning to the north.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.480]   The wind continues swirling along on its circular courses.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.960]   The wind returns.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   So we got the sun.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.360]   Pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.480]   And then we got the wind.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.240]   Kee-yoo, kee-yoo.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.600]   Pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to kee-yoo, kee-yoo.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.240]   So we've got these wheels going right here.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.920]   And then in verse seven, the rivers flow into the sea,
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.880]   yet the sea is not full.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.840]   To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.320]   Why?
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.280]   Because we've got evaporation.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.520]   The rivers come in, evaporation.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.200]   Shee-psh, shee-psh.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.160]   Pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket to pocket.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.760]   Shee-yoo, shee-yoo.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.640]   When I've done this in past days, Josiah,
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.720]   I would have three guys stand up here.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.920]   And one of them be this, one of them be this, one of them
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.400]   be this.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.160]   And it is.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.040]   It's like a big machine, and it's grinding you up.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   You're going to hit your physical prowess at 27.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.200]   How old are you, Josiah?
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.480]   40, sorry.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.640]   You're going to start going down.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.320]   Can you stuff now?
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.400]   Enjoy.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.360]   All right.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.840]   Because you ain't in a little bit.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.000]   You white?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.680]   All right.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.760]   White boys can't jump.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.720]   That's just the way they are.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.880]   Verse 8.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.440]   In verse 8, we're looking at the machine.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.200]   And Solomon says, all things are wearisome.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.480]   You ever hear the guy that just said the world
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.600]   was a merry-go-round?
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.760]   I want it to stop and let me off.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:30.640]   I want to stop and have some kind of meaning and rest.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.880]   Does the world ever hit a climactic place
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.680]   that it just awards you?
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.160]   It doesn't.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.040]   You are young.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.920]   You get older.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.800]   You hit adolescence.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.920]   You start going downhill.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.080]   Your kids come out.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.760]   You get my age, where your kids are going through your house
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.800]   going, that's mine.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.600]   That's mine.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.160]   How long you going to live, Daddy?
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:53.660]   OK.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.640]   So you're heading down.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.920]   OK?
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.880]   And so all things are wearisome.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.840]   Are you all with me so far?
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.600]   Life is going to grind you up.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.080]   When you go back for your first reunion, you're only about 28.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.200]   Your body's looking pretty good, see?
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.720]   At 38, everybody's getting a little bit humbler, OK?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.200]   Because your marriage is now trying not to tank.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.120]   About 48, you now got kids.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.080]   And you're going to find out why in nature,
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.920]   mothers eat their young, all right?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.040]   Because them kids are going south on you, all right?
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:45.000]   I just got back from a reunion, our 50th reunion, OK?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.880]   Oh, man.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:56.280]   Man, humility sets in, because everybody looks really bad,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.640]   all right?
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.560]   Lord.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.240]   And so in verse 8, even though all things are wearisome,
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.760]   what's the next line says?
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.240]   "Man is not able to tell it."
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.720]   Man will not back off and say, man in himself,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.160]   with his reason, with his experience,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.480]   is not going to find ultimate answers of his origin,
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.600]   his nature and dignity, his moral code, what evil is,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.800]   redemption is, where history is going.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.840]   He's not going to find it.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:34.880]   Are you all noticing the word God hasn't been mentioned?
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.280]   That's for a reason.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.400]   He's looking at life under the sun.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.280]   He's not going to mention God here for a while.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.200]   It's been said that in this book,
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.640]   the name Yahweh, for God, is not used,
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.400]   the covenant name of Israel.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.840]   It's the word Elohim, the generic name,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.440]   that it's a book not just to the Jew.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.040]   He only mentions one aspect of the law in chapter 5.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.920]   But it's a book that the Gentile can read.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.840]   Can man find life, meaning and joy without God?
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.400]   Can you do it?
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.640]   When Adam is created,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.200]   the first thing he sees is a theophany,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.440]   God making himself known in a human form
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.840]   because Adam corresponds with who God is.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.800]   God is more human in that sense than we are.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.600]   We reflect him or in his image.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.120]   He sees God.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.320]   And in the light of God,
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.640]   God says, "This is what the stars are.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.320]   This is what the ground is.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.880]   This is why your hand is cool when it rushes
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.520]   because there's something out here."
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.920]   And it's called the firmament, and it's for you to breathe.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.400]   And the plants take in the CO2.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.720]   What's CO2? Don't worry about it.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.760]   All right?
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.440]   And they're going to give off oxygen,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.640]   and we're going to have a little cycle.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.600]   And these are animals.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.000]   They're not you, but they're hardwired.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.280]   They're going to act a certain way.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.560]   You're going to have joy.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.440]   And so before Adam does anything, Adam is a theologian.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   He knows who God is.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.400]   And now you can understand life.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.360]   Now, Adam, do you understand who I am?
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.200]   Yes.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Now you can have a wife.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.040]   What's a wife?
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.080]   Lay down.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.200]   All right.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.840]   Out she comes, Adam.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.120]   This is bone of your bone.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.360]   Eve, this is the one created first.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.920]   He's bigger than you, hairier than you.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.400]   He's going to take care of you.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.240]   All right.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.160]   So there's order.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.280]   And so in the original creation,
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.600]   everybody knows who God is.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.680]   And now you start living.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.000]   That's the way it has to work.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.720]   You've got to know God.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.520]   Then you can have relationships and a job
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.560]   and handle your money and have friends.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   If you don't have God,
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.120]   you're like an astronaut on a spacewalk.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.120]   What's the most important bit of uniform that he has?
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:55.080]   It's his tether that holds him to the mother's ship.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.640]   Because when you cut that tether,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.800]   you are lost in the vacuum.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.760]   What's the tether that holds you to reality?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.040]   It's God.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.920]   So you can be brilliant, wealthy, and everything else.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.800]   You lose touch with God
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.280]   and it's going to suck you into the vacuum.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.040]   And so he's trying to get us reconciled
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.880]   to the infinite personal God.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.000]   Our country started that way.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.680]   We drifted and have only in little periods come back.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.000]   But that's been the story of man.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.880]   The story of man is Genesis 1, Revelation 22.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.360]   Man in the garden, man recreated
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.240]   and a new heaven and new earth garden.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.200]   And in between is a footnote
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.640]   to how screwed up this thing has become.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.840]   But that's the alpha and the omega of your Bible.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.280]   Man reunited with God.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.320]   So if you are wealthy, handsome, smart,
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.520]   and all those things, you don't know God,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.560]   you ain't got a cut dog's chance.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.160]   And I don't know what that means.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.280]   But you ain't got one.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.440]   Can I preach here?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.640]   Keep looking right here.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.360]   Are you with me so far?
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.200]   All right.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.520]   And so man isn't able to tell it.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:20.680]   Life ought to discourage you at age three.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.240]   But man will not embrace a system that holds him guilty.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.440]   That's why you can preach any other religion
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.800]   and everybody will respond.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.200]   They don't hold you guilty.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.320]   The Bible says, welcome,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.720]   your deeds of righteousness are filthy rags.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.320]   And now we get in line to be forgiven
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.160]   and to become morally accountable.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.800]   And so man cannot figure this out.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.040]   As a result, the eye is not satisfied with seeing.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.680]   The ear is filled with hearing.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.800]   Man's always looking and listening.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.280]   Maybe somebody somewhere in some religion
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.360]   can give me something that'll make me have meaning.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.800]   Man's always in a quest.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.080]   As a matter of fact, when they kick Cain,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.040]   no, no, no.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.200]   Yeah, Cain out of the garden.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.080]   It said he settled in the land of Nod.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.760]   That means wanderer.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.320]   Always looking for something.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.360]   I was in the '60s.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.160]   We were trying drugs.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.120]   We were trying money.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.800]   We tried communism.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.400]   We tried, you name it.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.080]   We tried everything we could.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.240]   We tried success.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.160]   We couldn't find it.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.800]   By God's grace, we had a Jesus revolution.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.920]   People came back.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.360]   But we could not find any ultimate meaning
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.920]   until a bunch of us found Jesus Christ
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.080]   that brought us back dead center to God.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.320]   Well, he says, man is gonna keep looking.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.640]   That's why in about the 15th century,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.680]   Europe had gone to pot.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.880]   And so they now start coming west.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.520]   Maybe over here we can find the cities of Cibola.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.120]   Maybe over here we can find the Fountain of Youth.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.720]   Maybe we can find a unicorn or two,
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.640]   or a mermaid, or something over here that can give us life.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.600]   Well, we came over here.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.560]   You know what we found?
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.040]   The same as Europe.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.960]   We found a bunch of sinners.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.840]   And so that's why there's always this longing.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.480]   That's why whenever I was around y'all's age,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.640]   we had the drug culture.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.160]   It wasn't for recreation.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.080]   It was philosophy.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   The word psychedelic means mind expanding.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.080]   Maybe in an LSD trip, I can find truth and God out here.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   But you couldn't.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.400]   That's why there's so much of a preoccupation today
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.560]   with UFOs.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.360]   Man can't fix it.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.240]   Maybe Saturn can.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.800]   And so maybe some guy,
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.080]   but they always land at a double wide in West Virginia.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.440]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.080]   I don't know why that is.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.000]   I can't find, and anyway, I've seen all them UFO movies.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.320]   When they land, they eat you.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.160]   All right?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.880]   So you take off running if you see one of them land.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.080]   Maybe some guy from Venus can fix this.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.440]   All right?
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.440]   And so maybe science can, maybe artificial intelligence.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.280]   Maybe that can, maybe we'll do a revolution every four years
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.080]   and get a new president and he'll lead us on.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.400]   Maybe we'll elect new guys.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.960]   They'll lead us on.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.600]   We're always, man is not able to tell it.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.160]   We're always clawing and looking.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.600]   Amen?
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.200]   Keep watching here.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.080]   And verse nine, that which has been, past,
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.160]   is that which will be, future.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.720]   That which has been done, past, is that which will be done.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.200]   Your attempts have already been tried.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   You want to find life?
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.520]   Get you a white belt and some bell bottoms.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.440]   We tried it.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.640]   Smoke you some dope.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.560]   We tried it.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.840]   How about free set?
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.720]   We tried it.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.840]   You name it, we did it.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.240]   It's doom.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.520]   Be encouraged.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.280]   And so in verse nine, there is nothing,
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.640]   look close at your Bible.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.800]   Watch the word.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.400]   There is nothing new.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.480]   Nothing novel.
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.640]   Nobody from Venus.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.560]   Nobody from Portland.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.800]   Nobody's gonna find something new.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.280]   All the philosophies have been tried.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   We've run the gamut.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.680]   We're now in existentialism,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.840]   where you don't create, God doesn't create you,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.080]   you create God.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.840]   What do you want truth to be?
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.640]   What's your truth?
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.480]   Find it.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.680]   That's where we are now.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.440]   Man now has become God.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.640]   So he said, there's nothing new.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.840]   Incidentally, do y'all remember
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.800]   when Paul is at Mars Hill at Athens,
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.520]   all the philosophers gathered daily
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.720]   to talk about anything,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.880]   anything new.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.360]   That's why you went to Mars Hill.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.200]   Is anybody saying anything that hadn't been said?
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.360]   Paul started preaching and they called him a name.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.680]   They said, yeah, this guy's a spermalogus.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.080]   You ever been called a spermalogus?
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.560]   That'll make you a fight, my friend.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.280]   You don't even know what it means.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.000]   Sperm means a seed.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.560]   Logos means to speak or to pick.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.040]   A spermalogus is a seed picker.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.720]   And it means he doesn't say anything new.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.040]   He's just taking a little eclectic,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.120]   taking a little something here,
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:53.960]   a little something here,
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.880]   a little something here,
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.440]   repackaging it, and it's the old stuff.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.680]   But a bunch of guys listening to Paul said,
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.440]   oh no, Acts 17.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.280]   He speaks of strange deities.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.040]   It's the Greek word heteros, different.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.920]   He's speaking of a God we've never heard of
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.680]   because he spaketh of Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.080]   He's talking about God becoming one of us,
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.840]   dying on a cross, rising from the dead,
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.560]   saving us by faith, returning someday.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.280]   And so the old philosopher said,
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.280]   oh no, we've never heard nothing like this guy.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.960]   So man's looking for something new.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.200]   You must be born again.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.360]   It's gotta be a new birth.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.800]   Well, in verse 10,
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.120]   is there anything of which somebody might say,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.160]   see, this is new.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.680]   It's existed for ages, which were before us.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.920]   Solomon said, I've been around the block.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.820]   You can't tell me anything the Egyptians hadn't tried.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.360]   The Babylonians, the Syrians, all these guys,
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.300]   we've all tried it.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.340]   In verse 11, man is doomed to repeat his error.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.160]   There is no remembrance of earlier things
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.280]   or of later things which will occur.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.460]   There'll be no remembrance among those who come later still.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.360]   Man is doomed to be confined
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.800]   within the limits of his own reason,
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.840]   his own experience and his own guilt,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.360]   that he can't go outside of himself
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.800]   to see who the infinite personal God is.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.840]   What's the most important verse in your Bible?
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.880]   It's Genesis 1.1.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.360]   There's a beginning of the creation.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:49.320]   God was there, made the heavens, made the earth, made you.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.720]   We invade upon his existence.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.520]   The only reason the universe exists is because of him.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.440]   Once we begin there, we can let this God speak
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.320]   and he can show us who we are, what is our duty,
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.960]   what sin is, how redemption comes,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.520]   what eternity will look like.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.160]   Can you dig it?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.360]   It's the ultimate belief system, is Christianity,
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.880]   because it deals with eternity.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.400]   Had a guy say to me in a gym one time,
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.740]   he said, you know, you're a Christian.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.180]   Don't you know that a nice guy is finished last?
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.680]   I said, yeah, but bad guys go to hell.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.520]   Okay.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.360]   So you got to deal with eternity.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.120]   I don't know where that conversation went, but.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.720]   I'm gonna stop right there just a second.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.920]   Are you with me so far?
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.680]   So you notice he hadn't talked about God.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:48.600]   It's talked about man under the sun, making life on his own.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.960]   If you don't know the God of the heavens and the earth,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.220]   that incarnated himself into creation through his word,
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.900]   died and physically rose and can bring conversion
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.600]   from the outside in, you have not got a chance
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.020]   in this earth.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.680]   If it could have been found, it would have,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.200]   and we haven't found it.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.280]   And so he says, because think about it, Josiah,
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.440]   before you get saved, you got to get lost.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.240]   He's getting you lost in space.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.160]   In verse 12 and following,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.800]   and I'm just gonna touch on these.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:31.280]   He's gonna show you the three options
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.600]   that men try without God.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.460]   First, he's gonna try in verse 13, knowledge.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:45.080]   I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.840]   all that's been done under heaven.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   He's studying history, politics, philosophy, economics.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.720]   Have y'all ever gone to college with a perennial student?
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.920]   That's just always learning.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.320]   Well, that's what he's trying to do.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.520]   It's your freshman year when you're gonna go
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.540]   and learn stuff, hypothetically.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:13.080]   And he says in verse 13, to do this is a grievous task
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.440]   God has given, the Hebrew says, to the sons of Adam.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.680]   We're fallen.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.640]   So if you're gonna search and find through Freud
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.240]   and Nietzsche and Socrates and the Gilgamesh epic
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.800]   and all of these, if you're gonna find truth, good luck.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   Solomon says it's a grievous task to try to do this.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.200]   He says in verse 14, I've seen all the works
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.000]   which has been done under the sun
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.160]   and behold, it's vanity.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.160]   We don't find any solutions
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.740]   because what's crooked can't be straightened.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.740]   Life is immediately screwed up.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.160]   Humans are screwed up.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.920]   The family is screwed up.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.560]   The government is screwed up.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.940]   Human religions are screwed up.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.840]   He says, it's crooked.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.400]   He goes on and says, what's lacking can't be counted.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.900]   Everything falls short.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.080]   Tom Brady after Super Bowl V, he said,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.280]   you're never satisfied.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   I gotta do Super Bowl VI, then VII.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.700]   You never have enough money.
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.880]   What's lacking can't be counted.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.400]   And I said, look, I've magnified and increased wisdom
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.200]   more than all who were over Jerusalem before me.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.800]   My mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.280]   He said, if I couldn't find it,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.800]   you guys aren't gonna find it.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.680]   He says in 17, I set my mind to know wisdom
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.480]   and then madness and folly.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.000]   I looked at the good guys and I looked at the bad guys
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.240]   and I realized this is striving after wind
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.280]   because in verse 18, in much wisdom, there is much pain.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.680]   In increasing knowledge, there is increasing pain.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:07.880]   I see the problems, but I can't fix them.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.480]   They're unalterably messed up.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.560]   It's like man had a conversation with the devil
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.760]   or something.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.080]   Let me bring you back to that.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:22.280]   In the Garden of Eden, God says to Adam and Eve,
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:25.560]   here's the tree of life.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.900]   You take it like communion.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.140]   You fellowship with me.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.600]   Over here is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.160]   where you will try to know good and evil by yourself.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.600]   It's the tree of alienation, or we would say humanism,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.320]   of man making himself God.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.100]   Here comes the serpent.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.200]   He says to the woman, has God said,
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.960]   you shall not eat from any tree?
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.640]   From any tree of the garden, you can eat freely.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.260]   From the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.040]   you don't eat or touch it, lest you die.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.860]   You shall not surely die.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.420]   That's a myth, Eve.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.220]   To try to know good and evil on your own
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.760]   and to make it in life without God, that is not a bad thing.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.540]   The reason that that's wrong is that God can't be trusted.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.340]   He's a bad guy.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.720]   And he knows the day you eat of it,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.020]   you're gonna know good and evil
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.340]   and you won't need him anymore.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.280]   So Eve, the worst thing ever happened to you
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.180]   was God who wants to dominate you.
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:36.180]   You break free and follow, well, me, and will be free.
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.640]   Get your motor running, way out on the highway,
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.040]   looking for adventure in whatever comes your way.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.040]   Like a true nature's child, you were born to be wild.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:58.580]   Fire all your guns at once and explode into space.
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:01.860]   Y'all ever hear that when you go to college?
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.780]   You still go to church and read your Bible?
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.940]   Child, you need to grow up and fly, little bird.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.740]   Let's smoke this, drink that, do this.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.820]   And you'll find life.
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.300]   God said, in the day you eat of it,
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:22.820]   you will surely, you're a dead man.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.220]   We have cut your tether and you're gone.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   Chapter two, I said to myself,
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.540]   come now, I'll test you with pleasure.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.120]   So we've tried intellectualism, let's try hedonism.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.820]   We're now in our sophomore year.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:44.600]   We're gonna pledge Kappa Alouette over here, okay.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.900]   He said, I'll test you with pleasure.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.020]   I love the next phrase, enjoy yourself.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.260]   Like a commercial, go for the high life.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.180]   And I said of laughter, I said, it was futility.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.700]   I said of laughter, it's crazy.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.440]   I remember in my pagan days,
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.060]   I went to the University of North Texas.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.540]   Did you tell them I was one of the great quarterbacks
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.060]   in the history of college football?
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:14.300]   Led my team to seven wins in four years
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.660]   that I was at North Texas.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:23.180]   Ever so often, we'd come down to Dallas
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.060]   and just get wasted.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.060]   We'd go to a place called the Lemon Tree Lounge.
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.840]   And you know, there's all kinds of stuff.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.860]   There's women, there's men, there's booze, there's music.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.940]   That ain't a good mix right there.
[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.100]   And they're playing all this music.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.300]   And I remember looking over in the bar mirror
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.860]   and seeing myself.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.940]   All right.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:54.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.720]   And I just looked at myself and everybody else.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.800]   And I said, this is a bad deal right here.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.420]   Somebody's gonna get shot.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.560]   I just looked at it and I said,
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.960]   every time Josiah, I read that verse too,
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.720]   that's me at the Lemon Tree Lounge.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.080]   This is madness.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   What does it accomplish?
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.080]   I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.920]   while my mind was guiding me wisely.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.060]   That means I got drunk and took notes.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.640]   Are we having fun?
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.480]   No.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:36.080]   To see what good there is.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.800]   So we've tried intellectualism.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.900]   We tried hedonism.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.780]   How much drinking do you have to do?
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.360]   How much sex do you need to have?
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.720]   After a while, it's just old stuff.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.440]   So he says, it didn't work.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.160]   So now we go to our junior year.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.120]   Verse four, we're gonna try materialism.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.840]   We'll make a billion dollars and move to Dallas.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:05.000]   And so I enlarge my works and build houses for myself,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.120]   vineyards for myself, parks for myself.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.660]   Verse six, water for myself,
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.920]   all the way down to where else?
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.120]   Let's see.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.920]   Verse eight, collected for myself, silver and gold,
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.000]   the treasure of kings and many concubines.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.880]   So I made all the money, all the pleasure
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.960]   and all the learning I could have.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.920]   And verse nine, I became great and increased more.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.560]   I was the greatest.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:36.280]   Verse 10, all my eyes desired, I didn't refuse.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.360]   My hands in verse 11, he says in verse 10,
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.680]   I didn't withhold my heart from any pleasure.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.220]   My heart was pleased because of my labor.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.920]   What that means, Josiah, is I did have pleasure
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.860]   clearing the land, building a park,
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.180]   building a house, planting vineyards.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.140]   He said that was fun.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.180]   It is fun to be like God and with opposable thumbs
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.300]   and radiuses and balls and socket,
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.820]   we can do all kinds of things and we can make things.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:08.660]   That's fun.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.480]   Remember when you were a little boy,
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   they give you a Christmas present,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.900]   throw the present away and play with the box.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.180]   You remember that?
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.180]   Because you like creating.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.240]   So Solomon says, it's great to create,
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.500]   but ultimately he says, there's no profit in them.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.820]   He says in verse 12 and following,
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.980]   I've learned that it's better to be wise than an idiot.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.980]   But in verse 14, one fate befalls them all.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:40.100]   What's the one fate that befalls wise men
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.680]   and idiots alike?
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.520]   Death.
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.760]   I don't care who you are.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.820]   You're gonna die.
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.540]   And then you're gonna leave it to your kids.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.380]   God help you.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.700]   And they're gonna put it on the curb
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.180]   'cause they want to jet ski.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.220]   All right.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.780]   So they're gonna sell all your precious stuff
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.740]   to get a tent when they travel.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:04.740]   And so in verse 17, we've tried them all.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.460]   Here's the conclusion.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.540]   Verse 17, read that Josiah out loud.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:15.540]   I hated life.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:19.900]   Verse 18, read that Josiah.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:25.760]   I hated my work.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.400]   Verse 20, Josiah.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:36.980]   I despaired.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.680]   You see what the results was?
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.520]   I hated life.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.140]   I hated all the work that I'd done.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.760]   And I am despairing.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.280]   Francis Schaeffer said, he's now suicidal.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.480]   And Solomon says, I've been there.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.720]   You're never gonna have the pleasure I had.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.780]   You're never gonna have the money.
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.000]   You're never gonna have the knowledge.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.940]   And I'm telling you right now,
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.520]   once you get through building and having fun,
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.460]   it goes into the ground, you die, and it's done.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.760]   Grass covers you up.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.620]   He said, man without God is suicidal, Solomon.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:19.380]   And so in verse 24, and we conclude,
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.540]   he hasn't mentioned God, but once in passing.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.240]   Now he's gonna give you a solution.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.380]   Would y'all agree that he has shown you the problem?
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.300]   That's the mark of a good Koheleth.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.180]   You show the problem and you show the solution.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.740]   And so he says, look,
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.380]   now there's two interpretations to this,
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.980]   two translations that get to the same place.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.900]   I'm gonna give them both to you.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.700]   One is, there is nothing better for a man
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.820]   than to simply enjoy life.
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.780]   Eat and drink.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.300]   Your labor is good.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.020]   Enjoy your food, enjoy your company,
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:01.020]   enjoy your labor, because it's from the hand of,
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.820]   what's the last word?
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.780]   God.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.820]   Solomon says in verse 25,
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.140]   "Who can eat and drink and have enjoyment without him?"
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.940]   He stops and he says, readers,
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.020]   you cannot enjoy life without God.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.200]   In other words, he ends this text
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.240]   with the Westminster Confession.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.420]   The chief end of man is to know God
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   and to glorify him forever.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.900]   Incidentally, the book is gonna end the same way.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.900]   When all has been said, fear God, keep his commandments,
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.380]   this is the whole of man.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.840]   We're gonna end the book with the Westminster Confession,
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.580]   with Adam in the garden.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.780]   Without God, well, what Francis Schaeffer say,
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.900]   "When there is no absolute by which to judge society,
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.140]   "society is absolute."
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.620]   You're gonna discover through history,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.600]   take it from an old man, man makes for a bad deity.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.340]   He's not a good God.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.540]   Man will screw it up every time.
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.060]   And so that's one interpretation,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.940]   is that you cannot enjoy life without God.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.580]   You better get him straight.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.620]   Whenever you have kids, I have two of them,
[00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.780]   Terminator and Rambo, okay?
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.660]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:19.980]   My two boys.
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.940]   And I raised them as good as I could,
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.020]   but when they were four years old,
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:27.620]   they put their trust in Christ.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.740]   With me and my wife, they prayed,
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.140]   one is a detective in Fort Worth,
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.460]   the other's in the secret service,
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.060]   they put on Kevlar and shoot people.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.780]   All right, that's their job.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.060]   But they know God, they'll shoot you well
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.500]   to the glory of God.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:51.100]   They love their wives, they love their kids.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.660]   So my boys are good boys.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.140]   Now that you know God, do you know where you came from?
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.380]   Yeah, you know who you are?
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.700]   Yeah, you know where evil's from?
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:00.980]   Yeah, you know how it's taken away?
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.260]   Yeah, you know what your duty is?
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.860]   Yeah, you know where the universe is going?
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.620]   Yeah, you're cool, you're set right there.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.980]   Now just fill in the gaps and learn stuff and enjoy life.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.060]   So he says, without God, you're not gonna make it.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.900]   The other interpretation is by a guy named Walt Kaiser,
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.400]   best Hebrew guy I've ever known.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.740]   His interpretation is in verse 24,
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.020]   the word better should not be there.
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.780]   He said the word better shows up
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.940]   throughout the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.340]   It's nothing better for a man than to do this.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.940]   He said in the Hebrew, the word better,
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.740]   right here is not there.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.660]   That's why some of you have better in italics.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.820]   It's added by the interpreter.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.740]   And so he feels that it should say,
[00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:49.100]   there is nothing in a man
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:55.540]   to eat and drink and tell himself his labor is good.
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.540]   This I have seen is from the hand of God.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.220]   He says that this is the greatest philosophical statement
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.060]   of the Bible.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.820]   There is nothing within finite man to be an infinite
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.180]   by which he will understand life,
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:12.340]   enjoyment and his labor than God.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:16.500]   If you don't know God, you cannot, verse 25,
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.260]   eat and drink and have joy.
[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.180]   It's always going to be depressing.
[00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.100]   It's always going to be anxiety.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.940]   You've gotta know God.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.500]   I like that second interpretation.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.900]   I believe he says, there is nothing for a human being
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.700]   to eat and drink and enjoy and tell himself his labor
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.060]   is good is from the hand of God,
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.380]   who can eat and who can have enjoyment without him.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.500]   Without God, you're not gonna make it.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.200]   In verse 26, and incidentally, Josiah,
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.420]   that's the first laborious time he uses the term God.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.660]   He showed you without God, you're a dead man walking.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.540]   With God, you're gonna make it.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.700]   In verse 26, to a person good in his sight,
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.780]   he's given wisdom, divine wisdom, divine knowledge,
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.660]   and just thus joy.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.380]   The sinner, he's given the task of gathering and collecting
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.540]   that God can give it to the one who is good in his sight,
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.580]   that God can save you and then God can guide your life.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.660]   Without God, you're a dung beetle.
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.780]   You ever seen a dung beetle?
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.980]   A dung beetle just collects his own crap
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.300]   and takes it into the house.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.060]   That's man without God.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.660]   You're just a dung beetle.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.500]   All right.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.220]   Great title for this sermon.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.220]   And so, there is the end of the book.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.740]   When I was in college, I went to college,
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.620]   nobody in my family had ever been to college.
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.320]   I went to college on a scholarship at North Texas
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.320]   and I went through intellectualism, hedonism, materialism,
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.540]   and I reached the end of my tether
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.540]   and I did not know what I was gonna do.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.340]   And I ran into one day, a campus crusader,
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:01.340]   came to my room in 1972 and he said to me,
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.580]   "I'm taking a survey, can I ask you a question?"
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.180]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, hurry up."
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.220]   And I'm trying to get out of the room.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.600]   So I got out of the room, I went up to the elevator.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.520]   "Can I ask you why we're standing at the elevator?"
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:11.360]   "Yeah, sure."
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.820]   Go ahead.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.740]   What do you call yourself?
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.020]   Christian, Muslim, Hindu, what?
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:16.980]   I said, "I'm a Christian."
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.060]   I was raised Methodist in Waco.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.820]   I said, "I'm a Christian."
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.060]   And he said, "What do you think a Christian is?"
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:24.060]   What a rude question.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.980]   He said, "What do you think a Christian is?"
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.140]   And I said, "Somebody that keeps the 10 commandments."
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:35.160]   And he just looked at me and he said,
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.960]   "You think that's a Christian?"
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.360]   Like I could be wrong.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.260]   I was a quarterback.
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:49.680]   He said, "You think that's a Christian?"
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.520]   And I said, "Yeah."
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.640]   And about that time, the elevator goes,
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:52.920]   ding, going down.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.020]   And so he just kind of left me going to hell
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:56.860]   and didn't tell me.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.200]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.300]   A couple of weeks later,
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.060]   I picked up a magazine called "Athletes in Action."
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:09.860]   They had a testimony in there of a guy named Terry Pape,
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.740]   linebacker from Stanford.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.740]   I read his testimony so many times.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.700]   I knew the answer was in there,
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.260]   but I couldn't understand it.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.220]   He talked about being lonely, aloof,
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:24.180]   no meaning to life, took long walks at night,
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.780]   reaching inside of himself, couldn't find anything,
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.100]   heard the fact that God had made himself known.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.460]   His son was the central point of his word
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.060]   who became one of us and died.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.020]   I mean, Jesus went to the nerve center of the problem.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.460]   I'll be a man and I'll die for what you did
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.020]   and rise for what you didn't, and we can do an exchange.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.580]   And he said, "I heard that."
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.780]   And I said, "Jesus, I've tried for 22 years
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.620]   "and I failed.
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.940]   "Come into my life and save me."
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.900]   The guy's name was Terry Pape.
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.100]   I read it so many times that I memorized what he had said.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.380]   I ran into the guy at Dallas Seminary in the library
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.660]   and I said, "Hey, you don't know me,
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.100]   "but you helped get me saved."
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:09.020]   And so I read that testimony, but it didn't do anything.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.000]   A short while later, I go into my room.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.700]   I've got this roommate that's 6'7" by 270
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.340]   from Houston, Cypress Fairbanks.
[00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.500]   There's a little guy that's about 2'1", okay?
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.060]   And he's talking to him and I looked at him
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.260]   and I sat on my bed and my roommate said,
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.060]   "This guy's name's Jerry,
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.420]   "and he's talking to me about God."
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.580]   And I'm thinking, "You let him in?"
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:35.300]   Yeah, because he was just going door to door.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.140]   Hello, I'm Jerry Cook.
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.380]   I'd like to tell you about the person that Jesus Christ,
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:39.820]   thank you.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.740]   Hi, I'm Jerry Cook.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.100]   And for some reason, my roommate let him in.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.940]   And I don't know why he did
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:45.940]   because Cartoon Carnival's on
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.140]   and that mean he had to turn it off, all right.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:51.140]   My roommate didn't miss Cartoon Carnival, okay.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.580]   And so he's sitting in there and Jerry's talking to him.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.420]   And I listened over his shoulder.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.100]   He's not even looking at me.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.660]   And he says to my roommate, "What are you?
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.780]   "Are you a Jew?
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:04.620]   "You're a Christian?
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.780]   "You're a Hindu?
[00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.620]   "You're a Muslim?
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.700]   "What are you?"
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.160]   Same as the guy asked me.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.180]   My roommate says, "I'm a Christian."
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:15.180]   And he says, "What is a Christian?"
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.980]   Deja vu, this is happening again.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.300]   He says, "What is a Christian?"
[00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.260]   And my roommate says,
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.760]   "It's somebody that keeps the 10 commandments."
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.900]   And I'm like mouthing the word.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.820]   Now I got the answer.
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:33.700]   And he looks at my roommate
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.500]   and he could have said a number of things.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.860]   Am I going too long here, Josiah?
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.820]   Am I okay?
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:40.020]   We got people going to hell
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.020]   and I'd like to tell them how not to go.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:45.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.840]   (congregation applauding)
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.340]   Where was I?
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:59.720]   He says to me, he could have said to my roommate,
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.860]   "Name 'em."
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.460]   And we'd have been in trouble.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.900]   Or he could have said, "Find 'em."
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.100]   All right, we'd have really been in trouble.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.220]   All he said was this.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.880]   And by this time, I'm not reading my book.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.400]   I'm listening 'cause I'm thinking the hound of heaven,
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.080]   somebody's after me.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.120]   'Cause I knew it wasn't Rex.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.160]   I knew he was going to hell.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.720]   All right, so I didn't even count that.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:28.520]   This guy says, he just looks at my roommate and he says,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.560]   "You keep 'em.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.640]   "You keep 'em."
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.120]   My roommate was silent.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.520]   Habakkuk 2, the Lord is in his holy temple.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.360]   Let all the earth keep silent.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.100]   God has shut up all in disobedience.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:46.240]   My roommate couldn't say a word and I couldn't either.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.880]   And then this guy just ground the knife in.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.280]   He said, "When I say keep 'em,
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.800]   "I don't mean just mean the peaks.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.220]   "I mean the valleys.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.980]   "You hadn't just murdered anybody.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.180]   "You've never called anybody a name.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:00.140]   "You're not just an adulterer.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.380]   "You've never looked at a woman with lust.
[00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.460]   "You're not just a bad kid.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.760]   "You've never ever disobeyed your parents.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:10.980]   "You've never lied.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.920]   "You've never coveted anything ahead of God Almighty.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.600]   "You've sought Him with all your heart."
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   My roommate was silent and I was silent.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.300]   And I was just looking at his back.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.000]   And then he said to my roommate words
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.080]   that all of the universe opened right here.
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.700]   He said to my roommate,
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:34.000]   "God didn't give the 10 commandments
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.480]   "primarily for us to keep.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:41.820]   "He gave them as boundaries, but primarily,
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.980]   "He gave 'em to show us His nature
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:49.560]   "and that we could not keep them, that we are guilty."
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.620]   And he said to my roommate,
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:53.060]   "That's why the Bible doesn't end
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:54.980]   "with the 10 commandments.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:58.380]   "It goes on to people that broke 'em
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:01.340]   "and then His Son came to die.
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.980]   "That He lived perfectly under the law.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.340]   "He died to the punishment of the law
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.100]   "and He rose from the dead.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.180]   "So our victory was won by Him.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.900]   "And by receiving Him," he said,
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.160]   "It's not just enough to know this.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.880]   "You have to receive Him into your heart
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:22.200]   "and you personally with God have gotta have an encounter.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.480]   "You and God have gotta have an encounter.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.740]   "And you've gotta either accept this gift or reject Him.
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.340]   "And if you accept Him,
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.920]   "He's gonna turn your life upside down
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:34.820]   "and you're gonna have to explain it
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.500]   "and stand before the world with that knowledge."
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:38.860]   And then he left.
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.240]   My roommate became a bouncer in a Houston topless bar.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.780]   He was a defensive end.
[00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:47.300]   Okay.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.500]   It hit me and I went out of there
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.580]   and I thought, "If that's not true, it oughta be."
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:57.180]   Because I found nothing like that.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.800]   And I, make a long story short,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.820]   God brought me to the end of my rope
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.500]   and I got home, I knelt by that bed,
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.920]   locked the door and got on my knees.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   And I said, "God, I have tried for 22 years to find meaning
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.220]   "and I can't find it."
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.900]   I've never, 'cause I can never remember, Josiah,
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.740]   ever in my life repenting.
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   I can never remember feeling guilty before a holy God.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:26.740]   I felt bad I got caught sometimes.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.360]   My conscience had bothered me.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:32.820]   But I never, ever before a holy God said,
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.020]   "I am in a heap of trouble and I need you to save me."
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.180]   I would pray when we were gonna play Arkansas.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.020]   Okay, our father who art in heaven.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:44.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.920]   But that's all.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.220]   And I died.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:50.260]   I didn't know I got heaven out of the deal.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.000]   I just wanted to die and give my life to somebody else.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.820]   The next morning, something was changed.
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.060]   I was like a baby that had come out of the womb.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.620]   Everything looked different.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.860]   I opened the Bible, it made sense.
[00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.380]   Shortly after that, I tore up my knee,
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:10.100]   missed my senior year.
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.980]   They brought in a coach named Hayden Fry, anybody?
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.820]   College Hall of Fame.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.340]   And I thought, this is why God let my knee get injured,
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.760]   so I can play my fifth year and be Heisman Trophy winner.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.600]   God is good.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.020]   And Hayden Fry called me into his office.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.340]   He said, "Tommy, you're a fifth year senior."
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.420]   Yes, sir, I am.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.780]   "Why'd you wanna come back your fifth year?"
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.660]   Well, frankly, I wanted to play for guys like you.
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.020]   He said, "Well, we are flattered.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:40.020]   "However, we're gonna lose this year
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:42.940]   "and I can't lose with a fifth year senior."
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:45.700]   And so Tommy, Arriva Dirty,
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.860]   Chili Con Carne,
[00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:51.220]   ciao,
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.620]   bye-bye.
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.740]   And I got cut.
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.140]   Shortly thereafter, I started working
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:01.020]   at Louisville High School, getting my student teaching in.
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:03.420]   This guy comes to me, he says, "Hey, you're a Christian?"
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.240]   Yeah, I was a coach.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.780]   "Could you come talk to my FCA group?"
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.180]   16 kids.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.100]   I got up, I had it written down what I was gonna say.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.620]   It was called God's Plan.
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:17.620]   And so I said, "Hey, it's good to be here talking to y'all."
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:22.140]   And I talked about God's love, man, sin, Christ, death.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:22.980]   When I finished, I said,
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.420]   "I don't guess any of y'all wanna be Christians."
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.180]   Eight of 'em said we do.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.420]   Later on, they said, "Could you speak to the school?"
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.220]   And I said, "God, you'll be sorry."
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:36.500]   I was Barney Fife with one bullet, all right.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.300]   I'll do it.
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:43.260]   And God got me up there and I shared my faith
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:48.020]   and the place went silent and God blessed His Word.
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.500]   And I found out you could get paid for this.
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:51.540]   And here I am.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.620]   My point is,
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.540]   God has something.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:02.460]   He broke me up with my girlfriend, dated her four years.
[00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:06.100]   There was somebody, she much better off now,
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:08.780]   but God brought me to the woman
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.180]   He wanted me to have the kids
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.940]   and He has led me all the way.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:17.620]   So if you died right now, stood before God,
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.740]   and He said, "Why should I let you in my heaven?"
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:20.940]   What would you answer?
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:24.560]   If your answer is anything other than Jesus,
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:28.820]   you better stop because before you can go on to anything,
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:33.220]   you've got to settle this issue of you, God, and eternity.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.540]   What's it gonna be?
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.660]   You still get salvation the way Adam did.
[00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.160]   You eat from the tree.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.220]   You're a cross runner.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.580]   That's the tree.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.060]   You go to it and you receive Christ.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.740]   He that opens the door, I'll come in
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:50.900]   and I'll sup with Him and hymn with me.
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.700]   Father in heaven, I thank you for this book
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.160]   and it has laid the foundation right here.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:00.620]   Man without God is in the desert
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:06.020]   and money and pleasure and intelligence
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:10.740]   is not gonna satisfy us.
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:14.860]   That there is nothing in a man to enjoy life
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:16.300]   and say his labor is good.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.220]   This is from the hand of God.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:24.220]   Adam must know God before he knows anything else.
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.860]   And these young men and women, I have been where they are,
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:29.980]   I've sat in these chairs,
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.700]   and there's a whole lot of messages going out around them.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:38.700]   And none of them are about the infinite personal God.
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.280]   They are all applauding the next generations,
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:47.040]   discovering something that man has not found since Adam,
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.980]   and that is eternal life.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:53.980]   May this very night, you have a come to Jesus meeting
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.220]   in the heart of these young studs
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.300]   and you would guide them all of their lives
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.280]   into the blessedness of knowing God.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.680]   In whose name we pray, amen.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.680]   - Thank you. - Good.
