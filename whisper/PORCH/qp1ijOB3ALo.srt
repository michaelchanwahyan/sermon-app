 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,200
 >> All right, Porsche, how we doing?

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,000
 We doing okay?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,300
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,200
 Great to see you.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,500
 Welcome, it's so good to have you here in the room.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 We do not take it for granted that you would give us your

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
 time here this evening.

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,400
 Not just those of you that are here, though, it's wonderful

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,800
 to see you.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
 Thanks so much for making time to join us, but also all of

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,400
 you that are tuning in online right now, particularly all

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
 of our Porsche Live locations.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 I want to give a special shout out to Porsche Live Wheaton,

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,000
 Fort Worth, and Dayton.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,900
 It is a joy to get to be a part of what God is doing amongst

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,500
 a generation of young adults, not just in Dallas, not just

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
 in America, but really all over the globe.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,200
 We're going to talk a little bit more about that, which is

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,300
 why we have been particularly in this series.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,000
 But I just want to set things up for us tonight by leading

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
 off with a story.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,000
 You see, last week when I was beginning to plan this message,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,600
 it did not occur to me until that time that it's almost

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,500
 exactly 10 years from the date that some of my very best

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,600
 friends and I planned what was going to be the trip of a

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,500
 lifetime. You see, at that time, I had just graduated college,

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,000
 was working in the young adult world, and my buddies were

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,500
 still finishing up all their master's degree at Texas A&M.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,700
 And we thought, man, we've got to round this thing out in

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,100
 style. Like it has been an amazing four or five years, all

33
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,900
 of us together, and we have got to close this chapter of

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,600
 life in the biggest, best possible way.

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,700
 And so what we decided to do is we decided to take what

36
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,200
 was going to be the college cruise of the century.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
 You see, everybody that we knew and everybody that we would

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,400
 want to know was going to be on this specific boat. People

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,000
 from different universities all around the nation descending

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,600
 onto this ship for a five-day Caribbean island-hopping

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,200
 adventure. It was going to be awesome. That is until I visited

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,700
 with my then-girlfriend, now wife, Brooke, and I learned

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,900
 that we also happened to have her sister's wedding that

44
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,600
 exact same week. Yes. All of my excitement was instantaneously

45
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,000
 replaced with regret. You see, the reason why is I had made

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,100
 a massive mistake. I had already given her my word that I

47
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,400
 was going to go to the wedding with her. You see, this was

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,600
 the woman that I intended to spend the rest of my life with.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,500
 These were her family members and thus my future in-laws,

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,200
 and I needed to make every effort to be there, but I had

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,000
 already put money down on this trip. And so I found myself

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,700
 double-booked, and not the kind of double-booked where it's

53
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
 like, you know what, I've got two lunch appointments and

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,800
 I've got to find a way to make one off and make one work.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,700
 No, I was double-booked between two of what were likely

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,800
 to be the most important, two of the more important events

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 that would ever take place in my life. These were my best

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,500
 friends, the guys that stood with me in my wedding. Like

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
 this was our final hoorah. I had already paid the money.

60
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,400
 And yet this was my future wife. So what did I do?

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 I ate the ticket.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,900
 I went to that wedding.

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,400
 And I have learned the dangers of double-booking ever since.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,700
 Now, let me ask you, do you think that was an easy decision

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,800
 for me to make? No, of course it wasn't. These are my best

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,300
 guys. This was the trip of a lifetime. And yet what I knew

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,000
 in this moment is that though it was not an easy decision

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,700
 to make, it was an easy decision to stand by. I knew what

69
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,800
 was right. And although I hated to miss this trip, I knew

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,400
 I would always regret taking it if I went. Because Brooke

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,800
 mattered more. Why do I tell you all this?

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
 Thank you for that.

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,900
 That's the kind of crowd reaction I need whenever I tell

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,900
 stories that self-deprecate and exalt her. You see, in this

75
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,800
 life, you will find yourself similarly double-booked, in

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,300
 compromising positions of panic, torn between two loves,

77
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,000
 that which you want now and that which you want most. And

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,100
 it will be the result of some mistake you made, some error

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,200
 that you caused, some decision that went wrong. And what

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,200
 you do in that moment has the power to either fill you

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,100
 with relief or flood you with regret.

82
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,400
 You see, in that moment, you have to make a decision.

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,200
 What is the decision? You need to make the decision to

84
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,100
 repent. What the Bible talks about as a changing of mind

85
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,200
 that leads to a changing of life, like you don't stay the

86
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,700
 course, keep your plans, jump on the boat, and go on that

87
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,200
 spring break adventure. You instead decide to bite the

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,400
 bullet, eat the cost, take ownership of the mistake, and

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,800
 change your ways because God matters most. You return to

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,700
 the one you love. How do you do this?

91
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,900
 Well, that's what I want to talk with you about tonight.

92
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,500
 So if you have a Bible with you, you can open it to 2

93
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Corinthians chapter 7. If you don't have a copy of the

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,200
 scriptures, do not fear. We'll have them on the screen

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,000
 behind me. But we've been in a series called Revive. And

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
 over the course of the series, we've been unpacking these

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,400
 different principles of personal renewal. And the reason

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
 why we've been doing it is it undeniable that there is a

99
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,200
 surge of spirituality sweeping not just across our nation,

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,800
 but across the globe. I will not bore you with the data.

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,500
 You can go back and listen to other talks, but the

102
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,600
 statistics are staggering. Like what we see is that where

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,400
 Christianity was previously in a cycle of terminal decline,

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,400
 it is within the last year or so, reversed. Like we see

105
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,300
 young adults, young men, young women leading the charge

106
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,100
 as people are coming back to Christ and joining into

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,400
 his body in ways that we have not seen in so long and

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,900
 we dared feared we would never see again. And yet here's

109
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,100
 our conviction as we see God moving all across the world.

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,700
 I unapologetically want to see him move here. I desperately

111
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,100
 want to see God work in this room. You see, I want you

112
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,200
 to believe, God, I want you to believe this, that Jesus

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,800
 Christ lived and died and rose forth from the grave to

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,400
 give you a scope and scale of life that transcends what

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,000
 so many of you have settled for. He has come to give

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,900
 you something bigger and better and grander and greater

117
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,800
 than what you have likely allowed yourself. And so the

118
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,900
 way we get there is not by praying to God for widespread

119
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
 revival, though we should do that. It is first and foremost

120
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,700
 by praying to God that he would bring about inner renewal.

121
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,500
 You see, it has been our conviction from this stage

122
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,600
 in this series that you do not find revival by seeking

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,000
 revival. You find revival by seeking renewal. Widespread

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,100
 revival, it begins with inner renewal. What do I mean

125
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
 when I talk to you about this idea of inner renewal?

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,600
 What I'm talking about is a recalibration of your inner

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,200
 man or your inner woman around the person of Jesus. And

128
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,800
 what is so fascinating and not coincidental in the

129
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,500
 slightest is that as we started preaching this idea

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,300
 just weeks ago, the Bible Society released an article

131
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,300
 that quoted and coined the phrase "over the current

132
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,100
 outpouring of God's Spirit in our world as a quiet

133
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,500
 revival." You see, this revival movement that we're

134
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,800
 seeing not just in the United States, but in England

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,700
 and in Wales and in Finland and in Australia and in

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,000
 other parts of the world, what we're seeing is we're

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,400
 actually realizing that it is marked by subtlety and

138
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,900
 sincerity. There is a simplicity to it where so many

139
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,300
 people expected a lavish movement of the Spirit or

140
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
 they anticipated instead that there would be this

141
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,700
 widespread outpouring that would call people to

142
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,700
 their knees. Instead, it is not as widespread as it

143
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,900
 is individualized. God is working in the private

144
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,300
 places of hearts like yours, more so than in the

145
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,200
 public places of arenas and coliseums and spectacles

146
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,700
 alike. I want renewal for you because I believe it's

147
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,600
 through your renewal and your renewal and your

148
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,700
 renewal and your renewal and your renewal, who's

149
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,100
 not looking at me, and your renewal that God will

150
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,200
 generate revival. And let me just say, as I've said

151
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,500
 from the stage, I don't need us to be the apex of

152
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,200
 awakening history. I just want to be a part of

153
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,700
 awakening history. I want there to be a movement

154
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,200
 of God that transcends my ability in communicating,

155
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,100
 our ability in singing, our leader's ability in

156
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
 hosting. I want there to be something so inexplicable

157
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,400
 about your time here at the porch that it's not the

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,000
 porch's name you remember. It is the name of Jesus

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,200
 Christ that you remember, that his presence would

160
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,900
 be in this room and you would sense that, sense it.

161
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,400
 Like it would actually be mediated by your senses.

162
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
 It wouldn't just be something you know. It

163
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,900
 wouldn't just be something you feel. It would be

164
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,300
 something you experience. And so what we've talked

165
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,400
 about, the first principle of renewal was that you

166
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,500
 had to break up the fallow ground. You had to

167
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,600
 break up your hard-heartedness. The second one

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,100
 that we talked about is you had to cultivate hunger,

169
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,700
 a longing, a yearning, a desire for more of God.

170
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,800
 And here what we're to talk about tonight is this

171
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,400
 third principle of renewal, which is you must

172
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,900
 radically repent. And the reason we're getting

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,600
 into it is because I think so many of us believe

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,200
 we know how to repent, but we do a terrible job

175
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,900
 of it. And therein lies the issue. We do not know

176
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,300
 how to repent. And so I want to talk to you about

177
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,400
 how we do that together. And we see it in 2 Corinthians

178
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,000
 7. I think 2 Corinthians 7 is a perfect passage

179
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,300
 to talk about this idea of repentance because I

180
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,000
 am not sure that there is a passage of Scripture

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 that better unpacks the nature of repentance.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
 Yes, you see repentance all over the Scripture.

183
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
 You see it in Psalm 32. You see it in Psalm 51. You

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,800
 can pick any other passage and you can teach this

185
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,600
 idea. But what we really see here is the essence

186
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,000
 of what should be true for those that want to

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,400
 rightly repent. Now before we read it, we're seven

188
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,300
 chapters into this letter. And what we're going

189
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,200
 to find is that this is actually not a discourse.

190
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,000
 It's a narrative. Paul is telling a story of sorts.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,900
 And so we need to catch up to what's happening

192
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,500
 in the story. We need to know that things were

193
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,300
 going badly amongst the Christians in Corinth.

194
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,200
 And after having failed once through a previous

195
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,600
 visit to get them back on spiritual track, Paul

196
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,900
 sends his friend Titus with a strong letter of

197
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,700
 rebuke to try to spiritually recalibrate them.

198
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,500
 Paul's unsure of how it's going to go. But then

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,600
 Titus returns and he gives a positive report of

200
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,100
 his time with the Corinthians. He even tells Paul

201
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,400
 that his letter worked. So it's to that letter

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,300
 that Paul is going to reference as we read

203
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,900
 together. 2 Corinthians 7, starting in verse 8.

204
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,200
 He says this, "For even if I made you grieve with

205
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,300
 my letter," that letter we just spoke about, "I

206
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,400
 don't regret it, though I did regret it. For I

207
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,100
 see that the letter grieved you, though only for

208
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,300
 a while. As it is, I rejoice not because you

209
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,800
 were grieved, but because you were grieved into

210
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,900
 repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you

211
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,800
 suffered no loss through us." So what was Paul's

212
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 letter about specifically? Well, we don't know.

213
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,600
 Scholars are actually torn on the issue. They

214
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,100
 debate. Perhaps Paul wrote a letter that was

215
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
 addressing a wrongdoer within the Corinthians

216
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,200
 midst that was slandering his reputation and

217
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,800
 leading them to disbelieve and ultimately

218
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
 disconnect from relationship to him. Others

219
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,900
 think that it might have been a reference to

220
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,000
 his first letter to the Corinthians. We're not

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
 sure, but what we do know is that this letter

222
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,700
 had its--it achieved its intended effect. It

223
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,900
 ultimately accomplished its goal in that it

224
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,200
 looked to the Corinthians, it exposed them of

225
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,300
 their sin, and then it caused them sorrow. It

226
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,900
 led them into grief, as Paul describes it, which

227
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,700
 is important for our purposes as we consider

228
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,800
 repentance in our own lives, as we journey in

229
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
 individual renewal. We have to know that real

230
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,100
 repentance begins with feelings of sadness.

231
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,700
 Real repentance begins with feelings of sadness.

232
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,200
 Now, to be clear, Paul does not delight in

233
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,900
 calling them out. Like, he's not a keyboard

234
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,100
 warrior that gets a rise off of ripping people

235
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,600
 into comments. Like, that's not his thing. He

236
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,800
 doesn't just stroke together a letter the

237
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,100
 likes of which will leave them shuddering as

238
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,900
 they try to go to sleep. That's not who Paul

239
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,400
 is. That's not his heart. He is not an Enneagram

240
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,600
 8 trying to challenge anyone that might come

241
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
 across his midst. No, Paul, he says that he

242
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,100
 regretted the pain he caused them. And another

243
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,600
 part, he says that he is filled with tears at

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
 the thought of them. He does not want to cause

245
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,500
 them pain, and yet he learns that they were

246
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,200
 grieved into repenting, and he says, "Man, this

247
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
 was worthwhile." You see, according to Paul, the

248
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,600
 prize of repentance is worth the high price of

249
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,900
 tough love. What's tough love? It's that idea

250
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,100
 of telling something to someone that they do

251
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
 not want to hear, though they need to hear it

252
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
 because it is the most loving thing for you to

253
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,800
 say to them. This is exactly what Paul has just

254
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,400
 done in this moment. Why has he done it? Because

255
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,200
 he wants to call them to repentance, and it was

256
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,200
 achieved. Now, why is repentance something worth

257
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
 rejoicing in? Well, we need to understand what

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
 repentance actually is. You see, the Greek word

259
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,200
 for repentance is the word metanoia. We could

260
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,000
 get into the architecture of how that word is

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
 actually put together, but really what you need

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,300
 to know is very simply that word means to change

263
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,700
 one's mind. You see, it is always applied within

264
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,500
 the scriptures in the context of someone's sin.

265
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,700
 Now, whenever we're in Christian circles, if you

266
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
 grew up in the church, and the idea of repentance

267
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,000
 was ever brought to the table, what you probably

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,900
 thought is it's a change in action. Like, "Hey,

269
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,800
 you got to stop doing that. You better stop doing

270
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,400
 that. Are you going to stop doing that? It's time

271
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,100
 to stop doing that." That would kind of be the

272
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,000
 approach to repentance. It's a change in action,

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,300
 and yet here's what I would say. That is not

274
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,400
 wrong, but that is the wrong place to begin. What

275
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,400
 we have to understand is that repentance is not

276
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
 just a change in action. According to Paul, it

277
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,700
 is a change in persuasion. It's an emotional

278
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,400
 shift that leads to a behavioral shift. That's

279
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,000
 how he's unpacking it here, which makes sense.

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,900
 You throw a punch because you're angry. You

281
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,300
 laugh because you're happy. You repent because

282
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,400
 you're sad over your sin. It's a natural cause

283
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,800
 and effect. There is an emotional reaction that

284
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,700
 leads to a behavioral reaction, and yet too often

285
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,600
 we're really bad at this. Like, we choose to

286
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,500
 specialize in one or the other. We specialize in

287
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,200
 emotion, or we specialize in action. You see,

288
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
 some of us, we're all emotion, and we're no

289
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,100
 action when it comes to our repentance, and so

290
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,000
 what we feel is we feel a guilty conscience. We

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,400
 feel bad about the sin we've done, but we do

292
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,000
 nothing about it. This is the guy, not looking

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,900
 at any of you, that shows up to group and says,

294
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,600
 "I slipped up again," but never actually takes

295
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,800
 matters into his own hands and does something

296
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 about it. This is the girl that confesses to

297
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,000
 gossip and slander, speaking down at someone

298
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 else's expense to make themselves feel better,

299
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,100
 but never actually changing the words they say

300
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,400
 following that moment. All emotion, no action.

301
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,900
 The Scriptures decry this kind of behavior.

302
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
 James 1:22 would say, "But be doers of the

303
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,300
 Word, not hearers only deceiving yourselves."

304
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,600
 Luke 6:45, from Jesus, he would say, "Why do

305
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,000
 you call me Lord, Lord, yet not do what I tell

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,400
 you?" But there's a second group that's all

307
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,500
 action with no emotion. This would be the idea

308
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,200
 of mindless compliance. It's doing all the

309
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,100
 right things, but with all the wrong heart.

310
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,200
 It's legalism. It's legalism, and Jesus has

311
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
 just as much of an issue with this, for he

312
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,900
 says in Matthew 15, 8, "This people, they honor

313
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,700
 me with their lips, but their heart is far

314
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:31,700
 from me." David says in Psalm 51, 16, 17, "For

315
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,400
 you will not delight in sacrifice, O God, or

316
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
 I would give it to you. You will not be pleased

317
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,500
 with a burnt offering." The sacrifices of God,

318
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,200
 listen, they are a broken spirit, a broken and

319
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,600
 a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.

320
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,900
 You hear what this is all saying? You see,

321
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,500
 repentance, it is felt inwardly, but it is seen

322
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,700
 outwardly. It is both. It must impact your heart,

323
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,500
 but then it impacts your life. You see, the

324
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,300
 strength of your emotions, it directly correlates

325
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,800
 to the strength of your actions. So let me give

326
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 you just an example, and a different kind of

327
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,300
 emotional example. When I was in college, one

328
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,200
 of my very best friends started dating this

329
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
 girl, and we knew that he really liked this

330
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
 girl because he decided on their very first

331
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,300
 date to take her to the most expensive restaurant

332
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,800
 in town. I do not recommend this, fellas. Don't

333
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,300
 set the bar so high. Otherwise, there's nowhere

334
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,600
 else to climb. He did this for himself. He put

335
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,200
 the bar as high as humanly possible. He really

336
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
 liked her, and the reason we knew this is he was

337
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,100
 really willing to take her to this restaurant.

338
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,500
 You see, the strength of his emotion correlated

339
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,200
 with the strength of his action. In the same way,

340
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,500
 the strength of your sorrow directly impacts

341
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,200
 the strength of your repentance. The strength

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,900
 of your sorrow directly impacts your repentance.

343
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:10,900
 Some of you, you may be asking yourself, "But

344
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,500
 Kylan, I don't feel sorry over my sin." I did.

345
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,200
 At some point in the past, I was heartbroken

346
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,500
 over it, guilt-ridden about it, stricken to my

347
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,400
 core, and yet I don't hurt any longer over it.

348
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,700
 Are you telling me then my repentance isn't

349
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:38,500
 real? No. The level of your emotion is not the

350
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,900
 barometer of your spiritual status before God,

351
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,000
 but the scriptures are clear. Your level of

352
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
 emotion says something about the seriousness

353
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,900
 with which you deal with your sin. If you do

354
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,500
 not feel something, the enemy is not knocking

355
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,300
 at your door. He is already sitting at your

356
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,300
 table, and you are more entangled than you might

357
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,700
 realize. So what do we do? Well, we keep going

358
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,100
 with Paul because as he walks on, what he tells

359
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,800
 us in verse 10 is that godly grief produces

360
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,500
 repentance, and that repentance leads to salvation

361
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,800
 without regret, whereas worldly grief produces

362
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,300
 death. You see, the other side of your grief

363
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,900
 is repentance. So you don't lean away from it.

364
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,800
 You lean into it. It was interesting. In a recent

365
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
 study by the American Psychological Association,

366
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,500
 researchers asked participants to name their

367
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,200
 single biggest regret in life, and the findings

368
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,800
 were fascinating to the researchers. They expected

369
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,600
 most responses to regrets to be around things

370
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,800
 that people should have done, and yet what they

371
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,900
 found is that most people's regrets were not

372
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
 around things that they should have done. Their

373
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,000
 regrets were around things they could have done.

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,200
 So instead of, "I really should take that nine

375
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,900
 to five job," people regretted instead, "I could

376
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,400
 have lived my life working for something that

377
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,600
 I loved." Do you see the difference? One is all

378
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,500
 about, "I should do responsibility." The other is,

379
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,900
 "I could pursue the possibilities." To summarize

380
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,600
 it more simply, most people wish that someone

381
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 would have stopped them from pursuing what they

382
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,300
 should be doing with their life and wish someone

383
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,100
 instead would have pushed them towards what they

384
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,400
 could have been doing with their life. Are you

385
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,900
 tracking with this? I feel like this is the

386
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,500
 heartbeat of young adults, that we desperately

387
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
 want to be connected to something great, to

388
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,100
 something purposeful. This is the good news of

389
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,300
 repentance. It leads you into this kind of life.

390
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,600
 Like, it's not just saving you from the kind of

391
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,500
 life you should be living. No, it is actually

392
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,700
 releasing you into the kind of life you could

393
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,200
 be living. Like, that's what Paul says. He says,

394
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,300
 "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads

395
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,900
 to," what? "To salvation." Now listen, he's speaking

396
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,600
 to a group of believers in this moment, so he's

397
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,100
 not talking about that movement from death to

398
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,700
 life, though that is available through a godly

399
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,500
 grief over your sin. What he's talking about is

400
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,800
 he's saying, "Hey, the resurrected life is

401
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,500
 available to you right now, and your godly grief

402
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,400
 that leads to repentance, it makes that kind of

403
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,000
 life available." The kind of life where you walk

404
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,700
 with God. We just say that and we think it's so

405
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,900
 normal. That's not normal! Walking with God is

406
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,300
 amazing! How crazy is that idea? The one who

407
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,200
 spun the cosmos into existence, who threw the

408
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,100
 stars across the sky, who littered the world with

409
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,700
 all its creatures, that same God will walk with

410
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,400
 you. He's available. He's not just available, he

411
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
 is actually inviting you in. That's the kind of

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,900
 life that is available, and godly grief leads to

413
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,800
 it. If you would repent, this is what's on the

414
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,600
 table for you, the life you could be living. And

415
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,700
 yet, there is a catch. Isn't there always with

416
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:05,100
 Christianity? The catch is this life is only

417
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,000
 available through godly grief. So you're telling

418
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,800
 me that my sorrow isn't enough? That if I feel

419
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,900
 bad about the things I do that are wrong, all the

420
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,700
 immorality that I know is true of me, if I just

421
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,200
 feel bad about that, that's not enough? "Kylen, I

422
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,500
 thought that you just said the beginning of

423
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,100
 repentance is sadness." Yes, but it's a particular

424
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,200
 kind of sadness, and that sadness is godly grief.

425
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,000
 You see, you must know as we continue this concept

426
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,300
 of repentance that there is a difference between

427
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,200
 godly grief and worldly grief. Your second point.

428
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,700
 You have to know the difference between these

429
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,800
 two things. You see, the opposite of godly remorse

430
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,200
 for sin is not remorselessness, that you're a

431
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,700
 stone-cold killer, that you're emotionally

432
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,500
 sterile, that you never feel anything ever at any

433
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,700
 point towards anyone. That is not the opposite

434
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,000
 of godly remorse. It's not remorselessness,

435
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,600
 it's worldly remorse. Do you see it? It's not

436
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,800
 apathy. It actually disguises itself to look and

437
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,700
 feel the same. So how then do we know the

438
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
 difference between them? Well, here's what you

439
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,800
 have to know. Godly grief is sad over the sin it

440
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 has done. Worldly grief is sad over being caught

441
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,600
 for the sin it has done. That is the difference

442
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,700
 in the two. One grieves because its sin grieves

443
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,900
 the heart of God. The other grieves because

444
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,900
 its sin has now grieved my heart in some way.

445
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,800
 Godly grief is a grief that looks like God's.

446
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,500
 It breaks his heart, it breaks his heart,

447
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,100
 thus it breaks yours. It's on his mind, thus

448
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
 it's on yours. If he feels a certain way, then

449
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 you do too. But worldly grief is different.

450
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,700
 So let me just tell you three ways that worldly

451
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,600
 grief can show up in your life. That way you

452
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
 can diagnose right here, right now. You can

453
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
 assess when it comes to the things that you

454
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,200
 feel bad about. If it's godly or worldly grief

455
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
 that you were actually succumbing to. The first

456
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,900
 way that worldly grief presents itself is it

457
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
 presents itself as regret over the circumstantial

458
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
 consequences of your sin rather than the

459
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,400
 spiritual consequences of your sin. Regret over

460
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,900
 the circumstantial consequences

461
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,500
 rather than the spiritual consequences. This is

462
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,000
 the classic political or professional athlete

463
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,900
 apology you see when they did something wrong

464
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,700
 that they don't actually feel bad about and yet

465
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
 they are held accountable to saying something.

466
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,400
 You see, they don't actually feel grief over

467
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,500
 what they did. They feel grief over what that

468
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,100
 is now doing to them. Do you see the difference?

469
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,000
 You see, they hate the fact that I guess my

470
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,500
 reputation is now tarnished. I guess my approval

471
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 ratings have taken a dip. I guess I have to pay

472
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,600
 that fine at this point. Their grief is over the

473
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,100
 consequence of sin. It's not over the sin itself.

474
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,000
 That's the first way. The second way is it's

475
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,900
 regret from something you did that you can never

476
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,100
 come from, recover from. This is the big bad.

477
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,000
 This is the skeleton that you have locked up in

478
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,900
 your closet that you hope no one will ever see.

479
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,200
 This is that thing that you have committed to

480
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,700
 taking to your deathbed, which maybe sounds a

481
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,000
 little bit dramatic, yet I know it's true for

482
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,600
 some of you. There are sins in your life that

483
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,300
 you look at and you say, if people knew about

484
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,500
 this, if they actually were aware, they would

485
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 not think the same of me. They would never invite

486
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,800
 me around. My reputation would be utterly ruined.

487
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,100
 I would never be looked at the same way. And so

488
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,400
 what you do is you think, because I can never

489
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,600
 recover from this, I must then never truly

490
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,500
 repent of it. Here's the thing. You regret it

491
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 deeply, but if Satan can't keep you from regretting

492
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,700
 your sin, then he will keep you from enjoying

493
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,400
 God's forgiveness. He will keep you locked up

494
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,000
 with that sin, that big bad, that thing that

495
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,200
 you could never let see the light of day, because

496
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,000
 then you're powerless against him. The third

497
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 way is it's regret for some sin that will

498
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,500
 inevitably happen again. Sure, you hate that you

499
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 do this, and yet you silently resign to the

500
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,300
 fact that it's going to happen again. I'm an

501
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,200
 angry guy. I want to be better, but I can't help

502
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,400
 that. I'm just angry. I'm defensive when conflict

503
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,300
 arises. That's just my natural propensity. I'm

504
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,000
 an escalator. I want to get better at that, but

505
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,600
 man, it's always going to be a part of who I

506
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,700
 am. Or man, you know, I don't want to lust, and

507
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,300
 yet it's hard for me to ever think about a

508
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,700
 world in which I won't just have eyes for my

509
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,900
 wife. I'm always going to have eyes for other

510
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,400
 women. Or it's that idea that, man, I'm always

511
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,900
 going to go stress shopping, because that's the

512
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,000
 way that I deal with the chaos in my world. Or

513
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,900
 I'm just going to have another drink, because I

514
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,700
 only know how to unwind in a world where I'm

515
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,500
 having a drink. Or I'm just going to have another

516
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,800
 drink, because that's the only kind of world

517
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:59,100
 where I can actually have fun. You see, you

518
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,100
 don't actually believe you can repent, that

519
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,000
 things can change. And yet this should be good

520
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 news to you, because it is a declaration from

521
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,600
 God that they can. That maybe you feel locked

522
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,200
 up in this thing, but you don't have to remain

523
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,800
 locked up therein, for Christ has entered into

524
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,700
 your cell, and he has broken open the gate, and

525
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
 he has walked out innocent himself, that you

526
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,800
 might walk out innocent as well. This is the

527
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,200
 invitation. You see, worldly grief doesn't

528
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,400
 grieve over the effect that sin has on God. It

529
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,500
 grieves over the effect that sin has on you.

530
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,000
 That was John the Baptist's beef with the

531
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,600
 religious leaders in Matthew 3. He said this,

532
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,300
 "But when he saw that many of the Pharisees and

533
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,900
 Sadducees were coming to him in baptism, he

534
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,400
 said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned

535
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,700
 you to flee from the wrath to come, barefruit

536
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,700
 in keeping with repentance?'" These guys,

537
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,300
 they were just doing the right things when

538
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,800
 people were watching. They were not doing the

539
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 right things regardless of who was watching.

540
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,100
 Yet godly repentance always does right, no

541
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,000
 matter who it is that's looking on. So how do

542
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,700
 you know which grief you feel whenever you're

543
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,200
 caught in gossip, are defensive in conflict,

544
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,900
 scroll through reels and stop to look when

545
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,200
 you know you shouldn't, hurt someone's

546
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,900
 reputation just because you're jealous of

547
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,000
 them, take credit when it wasn't yours to take

548
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,900
 on the workplace, make a joke at someone

549
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,400
 else's expense? How do you know what sort of

550
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,200
 sorrow fills you? You know by way of what

551
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
 direction it leads you. You know by way of

552
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,100
 what direction it leads you. For a worldly

553
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:36,200
 grief, it sheds a tear, but it presses on the

554
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,900
 direction it was going, while godly grief

555
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,400
 sheds a tear and it turns back and it returns

556
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,000
 to the home from which it was sent. Which is

557
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
 where Paul ends. He says in 11 through 13,

558
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,800
 "For see what earnestness this godly grief

559
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,100
 has produced in you, but also what eagerness

560
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,300
 to clear yourself, what indignation, what

561
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,800
 fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment.

562
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,200
 At every point you have proved yourself

563
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
 innocent of the matter. So although I wrote

564
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,500
 to you, it was not for the sake of the one

565
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,000
 who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the

566
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
 one who suffered the wrong, but in order

567
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,900
 that your earnestness for us might be

568
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,800
 revealed to you in the sight of God.

569
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,700
 Therefore, we're comforted." You see, the

570
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,000
 third thing that you have to learn about

571
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 repentance tonight, if you want to feel

572
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,700
 this at a personal, renewed level, is you

573
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,900
 have to know that there is no repentance

574
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,600
 without radical removal of sin. There's no

575
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,700
 repentance without a radical removal of

576
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,900
 sin. We see this is true of the Corinthians

577
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,400
 response as Paul details their reaction.

578
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,500
 He gives you seven signs of their repentance.

579
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,000
 We'll walk through those in just a moment,

580
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,400
 but he unpacks all of that just to give

581
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,500
 color to how radically they repented from

582
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,400
 their wrongs. Like, they acknowledged their

583
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,000
 errors, and what they decided was to wage

584
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,700
 war on that which was waging war on them.

585
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,400
 John Owen is the one who famously said,

586
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,300
 "You should kill sin or sin will be killing

587
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,400
 you." They made their mind up, "We're going

588
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,000
 to kill sin. Are you going to make your

589
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 mind up and kill sin too? Otherwise, it

590
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,400
 will wage war against you. There is no

591
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,400
 neutral territory on this issue. Sin does

592
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,700
 not leave you as you are. It is always

593
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,300
 plotting. It is always scheming. It is

594
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,200
 always wanting to pull you down and suck

595
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,700
 you away from the kind of life that God

596
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,700
 has come to give. You want to live into

597
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
 the kind of life that Jesus has come to

598
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,500
 offer you? Then you have to wage war on

599
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,900
 that which is waging war against you.

600
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,400
 It's kind of similar to how my wife

601
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
 responds whenever she finds a bug in our

602
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,300
 house. God forbid a mosquito buzzes around

603
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
 or a June bug sweeps in or a spider

604
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,600
 scurries across the floor. It is like

605
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,000
 DEFCON 5 in our home. It's not just,

606
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,100
 "Take that out!" It's, "We have to batten

607
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,100
 down the hatches. We have to clean all

608
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,600
 of the baseboards. We have to caulk all

609
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,500
 of the windows. We have to make sure that

610
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,700
 we decontaminate every square inch of

611
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
 our house. Get out in the yard and spray

612
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,200
 bug repellent everywhere you can." You

613
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,800
 see, in her eyes, when there is one

614
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,700
 intruder that should not be where he is,

615
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,700
 she goes to battle. I do too by proxy in

616
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,400
 my relationship with her. You must do the

617
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,500
 same. You must go to battle. There is an

618
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
 intruder in your midst. There is something

619
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,500
 in your life that does not belong there.

620
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,400
 Yet so many of us are like, "Hey, good to

621
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,700
 see you. How are you doing? Make yourself

622
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,400
 at home." That's crazy! Why would you do

623
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,700
 that? Like, you might have neutral intent

624
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,600
 towards that thing. It might feel good

625
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,000
 when you hang out with it. But it is

626
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,900
 plotting your destruction! It wants to

627
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,500
 make an end of you. It wants to suck the

628
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,000
 life out of you, wrap its hands around

629
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,900
 your neck, and choke you of the breath

630
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,500
 that God has come to give. You must

631
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,600
 smother it. You must eradicate it. You

632
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,100
 must annihilate it. You must do everything

633
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,200
 in your power to get rid of it. And the

634
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,800
 way you know if you are is there will be

635
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,200
 seven signs that it's actually happening.

636
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,700
 That's what Paul unpacks, and so I'll

637
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,400
 unpack these with you very quickly. The

638
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,900
 first sign that he gives is that there

639
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,300
 should be an earnestness to your

640
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,500
 repentance. An earnestness. The Greek

641
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,400
 here is the word "spude" which literally

642
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,300
 it means to move quickly. It's where the

643
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,700
 word "spido" comes from, which is why

644
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
 people wear spidos. They need to move

645
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,300
 quickly through the water. You should

646
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,200
 move quickly in combat against your

647
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,900
 sin. You see, earnestness is important to

648
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,500
 repentance because it deals with sin

649
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,200
 immediately, not indifferently. Do you

650
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,400
 hear that? It deals with sin immediately,

651
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,700
 not indifferently. And I hope you hear

652
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,700
 me on this. The best thing some of you

653
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,600
 could do here tonight is respond

654
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,800
 earnestly to that sin that you have

655
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 treated so indifferently tonight. That

656
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,500
 you wouldn't think about doing it when

657
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,700
 you get home. You wouldn't think about

658
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,400
 taking care of it tomorrow. But you would

659
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,600
 sit in your seat. You would stay in this

660
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,500
 room. You would talk with one of the

661
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,700
 leaders. It's gonna be down to my right

662
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,900
 and down to my left at the end of our

663
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,600
 time. And you would process it strongly.

664
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,100
 You would pray until you start praying

665
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,100
 because you're earnest to see an end to

666
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,700
 it. You must move immediately. You see,

667
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,700
 repentance is a turning away from sin,

668
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,000
 but earnestness is staying turned away

669
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 from sin. Some of you need to deal

670
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,500
 earnestly tonight. And it's the best

671
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,300
 thing you could do. The best thing you

672
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,100
 could do for yourself. The best thing you

673
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,800
 could do for your spouse. The best thing

674
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,200
 you could do for your children. The best

675
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,600
 thing you could do for the generations

676
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,500
 to come. The best thing you could do for

677
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,300
 those whom your life will touch that you

678
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,000
 both know and you do not know. It's

679
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 bigger than you. This is bigger than you.

680
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,600
 Deal earnestly. The second is an

681
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,100
 eagerness to clear yourself. The Greek

682
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
 word apologia, which is where we get the

683
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,100
 idea of apologetics. It means to present

684
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,700
 a reasonable defense. You see, the idea

685
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,100
 here is that we would live our lives in

686
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,300
 such a way that it would be unreasonable

687
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,800
 for anyone to think that sin is still

688
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,300
 true of us. Peter talks about it like

689
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,500
 this. He says, "Beloved, I urge you as

690
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,800
 sojourners in exiles to abstain from

691
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,300
 the passions of the flesh, which wage war

692
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,600
 against your soul. Keep your conduct

693
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
 among the Gentiles honorable, so that

694
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,200
 when they speak against you as

695
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
 evildoers, they may see your good deeds

696
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,700
 and glorify God on the day of his

697
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,900
 visitation." Whenever I worked in college

698
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,700
 ministry prior to moving into young

699
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,000
 adult ministry, we had a rule amongst

700
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,900
 the leaders of our ministry that they

701
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,500
 should live a lifestyle that was above

702
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,400
 reproach. What that meant is, "Hey, you

703
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,600
 don't stay over at her house or his

704
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
 house past the point that would be

705
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
 confusing to their neighbors." Get out

706
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,200
 of there, man. Nothing good happens

707
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,400
 sitting in the driveway with her. Tell

708
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,900
 her goodnight and see her tomorrow. We

709
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,100
 would tell them, "Don't wear our shirts

710
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,700
 or put on Christian memorabilia and go

711
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,400
 to the bar. It's confusing for people

712
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
 that don't know Jesus. You should present

713
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,900
 a reasonable defense." We would tell them,

714
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,600
 like, "Hey, you keep short accounts. Don't

715
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,400
 let any root of bitterness take hold.

716
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
 Like, make sure that, yes, conflict is

717
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
 going to come, but address it peaceably.

718
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 Don't do so in a way where we're sitting

719
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
 on opposite ends of the table, getting

720
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,600
 after each other, but instead move to

721
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,100
 the same side of the table and reasonably

722
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,000
 process the issue." Because it's not with

723
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,100
 them or in you. It's this over here that

724
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,700
 we have done towards one another. You

725
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,900
 should behave in a way that upholds the

726
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,500
 gospel without confusion, Christian. You

727
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,700
 should present a reasonable defense,

728
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,200
 eager to clear yourself. The third is

729
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,300
 indignation. This is the idea of anger or

730
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,600
 displeasure. Some of you, whenever it

731
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
 comes to your sin, you're just, "I'm

732
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,900
 frustrated, man. My God, this thing sucks.

733
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,800
 I hate this so much." That's good. You

734
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
 should not be upset that that's the case.

735
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,400
 It's good that you feel indignation, that

736
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,900
 there's a righteous anger towards that

737
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,400
 which is unrighteous within you. But

738
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,800
 here's the thing. Don't mistake beating

739
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,400
 yourself up for beating back your sin.

740
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,300
 Beat back your sin. Deal with your

741
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,700
 behavior. But don't get cross and think

742
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,900
 that you're the problem. It is the sin

743
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,700
 within you that is the issue. You must

744
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,500
 deal with it for Christ has come to deal

745
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,900
 with it himself. The fourth is fear. This

746
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,400
 is the word phobos. It's rooted in a word

747
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,000
 that means to flee or to withdraw from

748
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,800
 something. This is what you feel whenever

749
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,400
 you're watching a movie and there's kind

750
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,900
 of a jump scene, right? What's your

751
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,600
 reaction whenever a jump scene happens

752
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,500
 in the film? You jump and you try to

753
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
 get away. Like you try to scurry out of

754
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,000
 the proximity of whatever is happening

755
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 in that moment. That's what this is. Your

756
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
 instinct to flee or to separate yourself

757
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,000
 from whatever's attacking you, which in

758
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 this case is sin. Like you need to know

759
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,600
 the application here is that you must

760
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
 separate yourself from sin. You have to

761
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,300
 stop entertaining it. You have to push

762
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,000
 it as far away as possible. You must

763
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,700
 treat it as something that is fearful.

764
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,800
 The next is longing. This word means

765
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,400
 desire or yearning. Like all of life is

766
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
 either a drawing near or a drifting away

767
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,700
 from Jesus. Every decision you make, the

768
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,100
 thoughts you think, the words you speak,

769
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,200
 the places you go, the music you listen

770
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,600
 to, everything's gonna either lead you

771
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
 near to him or lead you far from him. To

772
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,200
 be very clear, I'm not saying that if you

773
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,800
 are in Christ, anything can separate you

774
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,400
 from the love of God, but this will

775
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,000
 impact your proximity to his presence,

776
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,600
 your enjoyment of his goodness. And so

777
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,300
 you should, in light of longing, desire

778
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,700
 for more of him. Do whatever it can. Do

779
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,500
 whatever you can to stay as close to him

780
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,400
 as possible. I don't know what that is

781
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
 for you. Perhaps the best thing you can

782
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,500
 do, come tomorrow in your quiet time, I'm

783
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,200
 making it easy for you, I'll give you

784
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,000
 the agenda right here, is write down what

785
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,600
 stirs your affections for God. What is

786
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,700
 it? Worship music. Maybe, but perhaps it's

787
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,200
 hanging with friends, sitting by the

788
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,300
 fire, going for a walk, sitting by the

789
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,400
 lakeside, casting a rod and reel. I don't

790
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,200
 know what it is, but you have to work it

791
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,800
 out because those things, they deepen

792
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,400
 your longing for God. The next is zeal.

793
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,300
 The Greek here is rooted, I love this, in

794
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
 this word, zeal, which means to boil. Like

795
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,800
 your repentance shouldn't just be warm

796
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,600
 it should be scalding. Like this is a

797
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,500
 willingness to do whatever it takes

798
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,000
 to honor God with your life. Like when

799
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,800
 Jesus spoke about cutting off the arm or

800
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,600
 plucking off the eye, if ever it caused you

801
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,500
 to sin, this is the essence of what he was

802
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,200
 getting at. You see, too often we ask

803
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,800
 ourselves when it comes to matters of

804
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,500
 repentance, how far do I actually need to

805
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
 go? In Jesus's mind, he's asking a

806
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,200
 different question. How far are you

807
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,100
 willing to go? There's a big difference

808
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,100
 there. Too often we fear going too far

809
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,800
 that we never go far enough when it

810
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 comes to our sin. Now what does it look

811
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
 like for you to actually not take your

812
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,500
 phone to bed, but to leave it in the

813
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,700
 other room? I had a roommate in college,

814
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,500
 lust was his thing, and so we ripped the

815
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,000
 door off of the tinges so he had no

816
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,800
 privacy. You're laughing, but we were

817
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,500
 zealous. We wanted the death of this in

818
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,300
 his life. We would hit our knees

819
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,800
 regularly and pray to God for victory.

820
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,300
 Some of you, you need to be willing to

821
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,800
 hand over your social media account

822
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,500
 info so people can go in and can check

823
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,000
 your algorithm and look at your explore

824
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,600
 page and actually track what you've been

825
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,200
 searching, look at your YouTube watch

826
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,000
 history, whatever it is. Yeah, some of you

827
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,100
 are like, "Oh my God, that'd be really

828
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,400
 nerve-wracking," because you know you

829
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,500
 need it. Hand over your transaction

830
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,400
 history. Maybe you shouldn't be spending

831
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
 money the way you're spending money. I

832
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
 don't know what it is, but get crazy

833
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
 about it. It's worth getting crazy over.

834
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,800
 It's worth being zealous for. You need to

835
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,800
 be willing to be more, and you see, you

836
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
 have to be willing to go as far as it

837
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,500
 takes, but Kylan, I'm already confessing.

838
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,800
 Listen, so many of you, you're too busy

839
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,100
 confessing and you're not busy enough

840
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,200
 repenting. Like your accountability

841
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,700
 groups, they're just confession groups.

842
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,000
 You just show up and you just confess

843
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,300
 your sins. I know because I was in one.

844
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,900
 You know what changed the game?

845
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,900
 I started giving people permission in my

846
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,100
 groups to hold me actually accountable.

847
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,500
 What did that look like? They could

848
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,300
 ground me. Kylan, we're gonna put a

849
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,700
 curfew on you. Hey, we're gonna take your

850
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
 phone from you. Hey, we're actually gonna

851
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
 look at what it is you're looking at.

852
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,300
 They put parameters on my life. They

853
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,300
 treated me like a child because I was

854
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,500
 behaving like a child. This is the

855
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,000
 greatest thing you could give yourself.

856
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,400
 Dignify your community to hold you

857
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
 accountable in the ways that you

858
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,200
 actually need. And the last is punishment.

859
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,300
 We won't talk about that because that's

860
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,200
 awkward. No, punishment is an odd

861
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,000
 interpretation here. What he's actually

862
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,600
 saying is vindication or justice.

863
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,100
 Like in the life of a believer, repentance

864
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,200
 should propel you to a place where

865
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,800
 you're not just seeking God's forgiveness,

866
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,300
 but you're seeking forgiveness from

867
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,900
 those whom you've wronged. That you

868
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,000
 would pick up the phone and you would

869
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,100
 call that person that you spoke ill of.

870
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,500
 That you would actually sit down over

871
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,700
 coffee and you would confess your

872
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,500
 jealousy of someone. That you would

873
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,200
 actually be willing to sit with someone

874
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,900
 or write them a letter or type them an

875
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,100
 email, whatever it is, to simply reconcile

876
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,200
 the relationship. It's willing to take

877
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
 matters of justice into your own hands,

878
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,900
 repair the damages that you've made.

879
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,400
 These seven signs, they give you a

880
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,100
 picture of what should be true in your

881
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,800
 repentance. If you are looking for a

882
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,500
 litmus test as to the quality of your

883
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,500
 faith, listen to me Christian. If you're

884
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,300
 looking for a litmus test as to the

885
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,700
 quality of your faith, then look to the

886
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,300
 quality of your repentance. It will tell

887
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,300
 you, I'm convinced true Christian

888
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,300
 maturity is not seeing less of your sin,

889
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,900
 it is seeing more of it. It is knowing

890
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,700
 that I need more of God. I'm far more

891
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,300
 helpless than I dared thought, but He is

892
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,700
 so much more gracious than I ever

893
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:23,400
 thought to believe. D.L. Moody said, "Man

894
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,300
 is born with his back toward God. When

895
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,400
 he truly repents, he turns right around

896
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,400
 and he faces God." Repentance is a change

897
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,500
 of mind. Repentance is the tear in the

898
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,400
 eye of faith. I want to love you enough

899
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,900
 to say here tonight, Porch, and so many of

900
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,300
 you are guests in the room, thanks for

901
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,600
 giving us your time tonight and letting

902
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,400
 me go just a little bit long, but I want

903
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,300
 to love you enough to say, if your faith

904
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,100
 feels weak, it's likely because your sin

905
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,100
 has grown strong. It is likely because

906
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,100
 your sin has grown strong. And so what

907
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,700
 you must do is you must take action. You

908
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,500
 have to act. You have to first and

909
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,300
 foremost admit that you're wrong. You

910
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,800
 have to be willing to look to God and

911
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,900
 then look to others and say, "I have been

912
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,100
 off. I've fronted. I've postured. I've

913
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,600
 manipulated." So that way no one would

914
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,400
 know, but I am wrong and I'm sad over it.

915
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,500
 I'm grieved, not with a worldly grief, but

916
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,800
 with a godly grief. You have to confess

917
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,200
 your need for help. You have to be

918
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,200
 willing to look to God and to someone

919
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,800
 else and say, "And because I am, would you

920
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,200
 help me in these areas of my life? Let me

921
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,700
 not speak generally. Let me speak

922
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,400
 specifically with you and give you

923
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
 permission to do what it takes to

924
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,800
 protect me from myself." And then you

925
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,400
 have to turn away from your sin.

926
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,500
 Repentance often feels like a buzzkill

927
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,600
 because when we think about it, it's

928
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,000
 turning away from something that

929
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,600
 actually feels good. We can admit that.

930
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,900
 Sin wouldn't be, it wouldn't be devious

931
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,500
 if it didn't feel good. And yet it is

932
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,200
 turning away from what feels good and

933
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,000
 turning towards that which is better. But

934
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,200
 what about my porn addiction? Jesus is

935
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,500
 better. But what about my control issues?

936
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,800
 Jesus is better. But what about all of

937
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,400
 my body image problems? Jesus is better.

938
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,900
 Turn around and realize it for yourself.

939
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,300
 Take the first step and know that the

940
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,200
 step you've taken is not one that Christ

941
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,200
 has not taken himself. For he stepped out

942
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,200
 of heaven and into earth and he moved

943
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,800
 with the kind of, with the kind of

944
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,000
 emotion that was characteristic of the

945
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,500
 sort of sadness your repentance should

946
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,500
 feel because he was sad about the

947
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,400
 disconnect you had from God. He moved in

948
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,000
 and he wanted to bring you back to

949
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,800
 himself. He did everything it took in

950
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,200
 order to cross the chasm and bring you

951
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,500
 in right relationship. And yet what we

952
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
 know is that he not only shed the tear

953
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,600
 of faith, but he also, he was filled with

954
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,200
 the kind of grief that should be

955
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,500
 characterized by you in your sin. He felt

956
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,500
 not a godly grief, he was a God in grief

957
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,100
 moved by his compulsion and love for you

958
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,500
 to do whatever it took, even die your

959
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,800
 death upon a cross. And then he moved

960
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,000
 from that place knowing that there needed

961
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,600
 to be a radical removal of your sin. And

962
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,700
 he said, you know what will radically

963
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,300
 remove you from your sin? My resurrection.

964
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,400
 For though I die because of your sin, I

965
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,400
 will rise forth out of your sin and I

966
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,900
 will take you with me if you will place

967
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,300
 your faith in me. I will radically remove

968
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,500
 you from all that is wrong and I will

969
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,400
 radically restore you to all that is

970
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,000
 right. Jesus has taken the first step, he

971
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,500
 has shed the first tear. Will you take a

972
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,300
 step here tonight, not tomorrow, not the

973
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,500
 day after, not next week when it's

974
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,900
 convenient, right here tonight. Because he's

975
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,800
 already stepped towards you. Will you

976
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,600
 shed a tear? For Christ has shed a tear

977
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,700
 to save you unto himself forever. Let me

978
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,000
 pray for you. God we love you, thanks for

979
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,900
 tonight. You and I visited earlier about

980
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:24,200
 this, but God repentance, we might see

981
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,000
 the first fruits of here, but we will not

982
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,700
 see the full effect here. For God

983
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,400
 repentance does not happen only in an

984
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,800
 evening, it happens day by day, moment by

985
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,300
 moment, from this evening henceforth. I pray God please

986
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,900
 change minds here, turn people from their

987
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,900
 sin, that they might change their lives

988
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:59,700
 and walk with you instead. I just feel a

989
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,900
 sensing from the Spirit that some of you

990
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,200
 here do not know Jesus and he's calling

991
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,000
 you to turn around, he's calling you to

992
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 come home, he's telling you place your

993
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,600
 faith in me. I'm good where you are not,

994
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,800
 I am right where you are wrong, I am

995
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,400
 perfect for all of your imperfection.

996
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,500
 Place your faith in me, call me the Lord

997
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,100
 of your life and walk with me as I lead

998
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,800
 you into your own. Others of you, you have

999
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,800
 been harboring that thing which you have

1000
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,300
 hidden for so long, you have been

1001
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,100
 struggling with that sin and it's time

1002
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,900
 to make an end. Let victory ring out in

1003
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,100
 this place, take action for Christ

1004
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,600
 himself has taken action for you. We love

1005
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,800
 you Jesus, thank you for tonight, it's in

1006
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,400
 your name we pray, amen.
