[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:26.680]   Love it.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.820]   Let's go, new series, kicking off.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.060]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.160]   Very excited.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.660]   Yes, we are kicking off a new series tonight,
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180]   asking for a friend, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.340]   friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Tulsa,
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.620]   Spring, Cedar Rapids, wherever you are joining us
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.580]   from tonight.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.780]   I'm gonna start with a little bit of a story.
[00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.140]   I, six years ago, this past weekend,
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.460]   got engaged on 7/7/12.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.700]   Me, Justin Bieber, have that in common now.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180]   And I know, I was like, dude, come on, man,
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.100]   get your own day.
[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.260]   And anyway, so, hey, I'm gonna tell a little bit
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.660]   of the day and how that came.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.180]   So my wife's birthday was on 7/7/12.
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.740]   It's every year on 7/7.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.020]   And I decided, I came up with this plot.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.760]   I thought that she would assume there's no way
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.740]   I'm gonna get engaged on her birthday
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.220]   'cause she'd be like, oh, that's so like plain.
[00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.260]   Of course he's not, so I was one step ahead of her.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260]   And of course I'm gonna get engaged on her birthday
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.540]   'cause that's when she would least expect it
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.460]   because reverse psychology of her reverse psychology.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.220]   Anyway, so I put together this whole plan,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.540]   this elaborate scheme, and began to plan out
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.540]   what we would do.
[00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.780]   And towards the evening part of kind of that
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140]   birthday day celebration, I told her,
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.860]   hey, I'm gonna pick you up about five o'clock.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.420]   We're gonna go to the Arboretum.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.420]   Then we're gonna go to have dinner at this place
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.260]   after that for your birthday and celebrate it.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.540]   I intentionally wove in a little misstep
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.140]   to throw her off the scent in case she was thinking
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.080]   we are going to get engaged at this time.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.180]   So here's what I did.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120]   I told her we're gonna go to the Arboretum,
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.580]   but I knew it was Saturday night
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.120]   and the Arboretum is closed on Saturday night.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.760]   So I'm like literally during the day calling to confirm,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.220]   hey, I need you guys to for sure be not open tonight
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.320]   because we are gonna deviate and go to another location
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.060]   where people were going to meet us.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.020]   And if we end up being able to get in the Arboretum,
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.380]   it's gonna create some problems.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.420]   So confirm for sure you're closed.
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.660]   And so of course they're like,
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.540]   yeah, of course we're closed tonight.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.700]   So we show up at the Arboretum,
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.860]   we go into there and it's like, oh no, it's closed.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.540]   Guess we'll have to go somewhere else.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.740]   I guess we'll kill some time in a park
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.000]   before our dinner reservations where I had it all planned out.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.740]   Come to find out, weeks later,
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.460]   she was already anticipating going,
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.500]   we're for sure getting engaged.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.700]   Oh my gosh, he didn't even check
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.140]   that the Arboretum was gonna be closed?
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.860]   My boyfriend has no sense of details.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.540]   And but in the moment I'm like, oh, bummer.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.100]   Okay, let's go over here.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.020]   And we go to this park and where I had friends
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.480]   that were supposed to meet and like they were hiding
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.500]   in someone's yards, bushes to take pictures.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.780]   And it starts pouring.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.780]   And I'm like, oh no, we need to get over to this one area.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.220]   And she's like, why don't we just do it another day?
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.100]   No, I really think we should try.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.320]   And it's like soaking wet.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.260]   The grass is like literally soaking mud.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.320]   And to a point where I have to like piggyback ride her
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.640]   over to this place, kinda like,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.620]   it's really, look at the ducks, they're beautiful.
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.220]   And she's going, what is wrong with,
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.760]   what is wrong with me for dating him?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760]   And the moment came and I dropped down to a knee
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.340]   and shared some nice things.
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.100]   And I asked her, Callie, will you marry me
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.260]   and spend the rest of your life with me?
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.420]   And she said, yes, yeah, get excited.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.280]   And from there, yeah, thank you.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.460]   And from there, something very interesting happened
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.780]   over the next kind of few days.
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.880]   So now we're engaged, all this anticipation.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.860]   If you're dating in the room,
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.860]   maybe you're in like or in love, wherever you are.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.580]   And you're in that moment where, man, you got engaged
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.180]   and I don't know what you anticipate happening.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.660]   What happened to me was not what I anticipated.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.860]   Over the next few days, I began to get filled
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.980]   with such doubt over, oh my gosh, what did I just do?
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.780]   Have I made the biggest mistake of my entire life?
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.180]   Is this the woman I'm supposed to marry?
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.360]   And all these different questions
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.340]   began to flood through my hand.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.240]   I know, really romantic ladies, for those of you
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.080]   in the room.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   And I'm like, is this even right?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.360]   Maybe this wasn't the right relationship for me.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.600]   And it wasn't because of anything really clear.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.540]   It just kind of was like these lingering questions.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.480]   Maybe this relationship is not right, maybe it's wrong.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   And people say things like, you know, when you know,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.360]   you know, and I'm like, and I don't know.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.200]   So does that mean that I know that I don't know
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.040]   that I'll ever know?
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   And what does that mean?
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.520]   And I just began to like freak out
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.380]   and have all kinds of doubts.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.260]   I went to this on a trip that Watermark had taken to Haiti
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.640]   and had to lead this trip to Haiti.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.220]   And the whole time, like I don't sleep at all
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.980]   while we're over there, 'cause I'm just thinking,
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.820]   what have I done?
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.640]   What have I done?
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.480]   What have I done?
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.820]   As I'm sitting in this international, you know,
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.020]   environment for that week.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.840]   And I remember a process with community
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.500]   and eventually came to a place where thankfully,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.760]   I didn't allow that to hold me back.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.460]   And I'm gonna come back to that story
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.500]   and kind of why I start there here in a second.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.700]   But the main reason I start there is because of this.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.740]   In the same way that in a dating relationship,
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.780]   or for me in that moment,
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.980]   I was experiencing some level of doubt over,
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.740]   man, is this right?
[00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.500]   Is this the right girl for me?
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.180]   Is this the right relationship?
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.560]   Is the fact that I'm having doubts,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.660]   does that mean that it's wrong?
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.260]   In the same way as often the experience
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.680]   that many people have is it relates to their Christian faith.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.660]   Then they experience some level of doubt
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.740]   and they begin to wonder like,
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.580]   man, the fact that I'm not really sure about,
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.380]   I've just got some questions as it relates
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.540]   to what the Bible teaches,
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.500]   I still have some places where I just have doubt in my mind
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.900]   over some of the things the Bible says,
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.540]   does that mean that my faith is wrong?
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.340]   That my faith is not real?
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.300]   That maybe I'm not a true believer
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.140]   or maybe this thing is just made up?
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.460]   Are these doubts creeping in?
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.280]   What do I do with them?
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.500]   I don't know if you've experienced doubt
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.620]   in your journey of faith,
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.780]   but if you haven't, it is coming for you.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.020]   Because it is really a common universal experience
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.300]   for anyone who wants to follow Jesus with your life.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.380]   Maybe doubts for you look like,
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.660]   man, can we really trust the Bible?
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.980]   Maybe you've had doubts about like,
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.940]   is Christianity really the only way?
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.820]   Like, you know, is it just because I was born in America?
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.940]   If I was born in India, wouldn't I be a Hindu?
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.380]   Maybe this is just kind of our expression
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.580]   in the West of what faith in God looks like.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.420]   How can I really know?
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.740]   Maybe that's the doubt that you've experienced.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.740]   What about heaven and hell?
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.740]   Maybe you had lingering doubts over,
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.380]   man, I'm just trying to believe in God,
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.340]   I just, I really struggle with the idea of hell
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.460]   or Jesus being the only way to heaven.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.900]   Maybe you've had doubts about just other religions
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.320]   and other belief systems.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   And maybe you've wondered if God can truly love you
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.520]   the way that the Bible says,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.940]   the way that preachers stand up and say He loves you
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.700]   despite all the things that you know in your own life
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.980]   are jacked up, that are messed up.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.620]   And you doubt, despite hearing it week after week,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.420]   does God really love me in spite of me?
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.660]   In spite of me?
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.900]   And what do I do with those doubts?
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.940]   Because doubt is a little bit like fear or anxiety,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.780]   if you think about it.
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.820]   It's not something that anyone plans
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.620]   or wants more of in their life.
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.700]   In other words, no one plans,
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.340]   today I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna be anxious
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.460]   between three and four o'clock.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.340]   It just kind of shows up and grabs you.
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.140]   In the same way, doubt is one of those things
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.420]   that we don't even have to attempt to do it,
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.900]   it can just grab us in a moment.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.860]   Just like a relationship, I can doubt,
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.560]   maybe this isn't the right person.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.940]   And in the same thing can happen with our faith.
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.060]   Man, maybe Jesus isn't the right Savior.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.220]   So tonight, we are gonna cover the subject of doubt
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.380]   of asking for a friend,
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.020]   of what do my doubts tell me about my faith?
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.340]   Does it tell me that my faith is not real?
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.700]   What do I do about my doubts?
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.280]   And we are gonna cover from three episodes
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.060]   in the life of Jesus, the three interactions that Jesus has
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.460]   as it relates to the subject of doubt
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.020]   and explore how you and I can experience
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.580]   further and further freedom from doubt
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.620]   and experience what really doubts tell us
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.580]   or what God intends us to do with those doubts.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.060]   So the first episode, if you watch Netflix,
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.920]   we're gonna flip through one episode after the next,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.140]   after the next, just kind of jumping all throughout
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.740]   the scripture, just like you would flip through
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.740]   and binge on a Netflix, Netflix, Netflix episode,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.180]   and we'll jump from one to the next.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.780]   The first episode we're gonna look at
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.980]   where Jesus interacts with a man
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.540]   who had experienced doubt or was experiencing doubt
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.180]   happens in Matthew chapter 11,
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.420]   and it involves John the Baptist.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.520]   These verses will be up on the screen.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.860]   You can flip there if you want to,
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.220]   but let me set up a little bit of John the Baptist.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.060]   So John the Baptist, there's a couple of Johns
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.040]   inside of the New Testament.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.540]   There's one who wrote the book of John.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.060]   Then there's this other dude
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.380]   who was not one of the disciples.
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.020]   His name was John the Baptist.
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.620]   He had the nickname the Baptist
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.420]   because he was really the first guy we know of
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.060]   that was baptizing people.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.880]   He showed up before Jesus.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.940]   He was actually Jesus's cousin, interesting enough,
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.460]   and John the Baptist had this huge ministry
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.300]   where before Jesus really showed up on the scene
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.380]   and became the figure that he was,
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.980]   John was out in the countryside.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.340]   This dude lived in the woods.
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.900]   He was known as kind of a man's man or wild man.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.940]   Think Duck Dynasty.
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.340]   He's out in the woods by the river
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.060]   just baptizing dudes all the time.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.260]   He has one message, really.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.740]   Repent because the Messiah is coming.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.060]   Repent because my cousin is the Messiah and he's coming.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.540]   Repent because you don't wanna miss the Messiah
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.380]   once he's here.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.200]   So this is what he would say,
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.380]   and we're told that thousands of people
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.500]   would go out and see him.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.380]   He's actually included in other historical pieces
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.260]   of literature outside of the Bible from that day.
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.580]   I mean, this dude was known.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.500]   He was a rockstar, if you will.
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.380]   A little bizarre 'cause he was, you know,
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.360]   Harry and Duck Dynasty out there eating locusts, we're told,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.200]   but he was a rockstar.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.660]   Even the king of that area would go out
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.180]   'cause they just wanted to hear him teach.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.940]   And one day he's out baptizing people
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.300]   and he's saying, "Repent, the Messiah's coming."
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.900]   All of a sudden, his cousin, Jesus,
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.180]   his younger cousin Jesus shows up to the whole crowd.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.060]   He says, "Look, behold, the Lamb of God
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.540]   "who takes away the sins of the earth,
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.780]   "the Lamb who takes away every person's sin
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.740]   "if they'll trust in him."
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.960]   He says in front of this whole crowd,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.740]   "This is the one we've been waiting for.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.460]   "I must decrease, he must increase."
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.780]   He says, "This is God's chosen one."
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.060]   You can read it in John chapter one.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.300]   And John was just a bold dude.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.300]   He didn't play around, he just drove right to the point.
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.900]   And that bold type of teaching that he exhibited
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.220]   or showed that day would end up being something
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.980]   that ultimately led to him being arrested
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.100]   and thrown in prison for his ministry.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.140]   And John, sitting in a prison cell,
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.940]   begins to move from that bold declaration
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.180]   of who Jesus was to begin to question things
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.360]   because he found himself in a circumstance
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.140]   where things weren't going like he thought they would.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.740]   Here's what happens in Matthew chapter 11, verse two.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.460]   Now, when John was in prison
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.740]   and he heard about the deeds of the Messiah,
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.560]   that people were telling him, "Hey, your cousin Jesus,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.420]   "he's healing the lame, he's raising people from the dead
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.740]   "like blind people couldn't see,
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.660]   "all of a sudden they can see.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.340]   "Jesus is doing all these amazing things."
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.620]   He sent his disciples to ask him, that's Jesus,
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.020]   "Are you the one who is to come
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.760]   "or should we expect someone else?
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.780]   "What just happened there?"
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.460]   Well, I'll tell you what just happened.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.460]   John is sitting in between maybe a couple other prisoners
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.420]   inside of a jail, so he's looking through bars
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.120]   and he begins to question.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.860]   After a few days go by, maybe a few weeks go by,
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.060]   a few months go by, where is my cousin?
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.940]   I mean, I'm the guy who like made him what he is,
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.020]   I'm the guy who said, "Hey, he's the one, he's the Messiah,
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.600]   "he's the savior of the earth
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.180]   "and he's out there caring for everybody else.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.720]   "Is he really the savior?
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.640]   "Why am I sitting in prison right now?"
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.540]   Maybe he's not, maybe I had it all wrong
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.100]   and John begins to question this man
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.780]   who just earlier in the story had said,
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.980]   "This is the lamb of God."
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.380]   The man who told everybody else,
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.140]   he's the one who is to come.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.100]   Now gets his disciples and he's sitting in a prison,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.640]   says, "You gotta go ask Jesus a question for me.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.480]   "I need you to go ask him,
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.300]   "like is he the one that we thought he was or is he not?"
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.260]   Because John found himself in a place
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.700]   that he never thought he would be,
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.340]   found himself in circumstances that he was like,
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.740]   "Surely God would intervene here."
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.620]   And he began to doubt.
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.940]   So the disciples must be thinking,
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.060]   "John, how can we go ask that question to Jesus?
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.860]   "You're the one who told everybody he is the one,
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.420]   "but I guess we'll go ask him."
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.440]   So they go to Jesus and they ask,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.780]   "Are you the one who is to come
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.940]   "or should we expect another?"
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.620]   And Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.400]   "what you hear and what you see.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.780]   "The blind receive sight, the lame walk,
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.980]   "those who have leprosy are cleansed,
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.760]   "the deaf hear, the dead are raised,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.500]   "and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.140]   "Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me."
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.780]   I love Jesus 'cause the two disciples
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.280]   who came to visit him have gotta be thinking,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.020]   "Are you the one who is to come and rather go back
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.460]   "and tell him the blind see, the lame hear,
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.340]   "the lame walk, the deaf hear."
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.700]   And they're going, great, check, check.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.720]   "Are you the one who is to come
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.660]   "or should we expect another?"
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.300]   He's like, "Go tell him the blind see."
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.260]   That he just says, "Man, you can see for yourself.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.140]   "The acts of the Messiah are clearly,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.560]   "the acts of the Christ," which is what the word Messiah
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.780]   means, "are clearly being shown by Jesus.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.260]   "And go back and tell him these works."
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.280]   And then he says that line of,
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.780]   "Blessed is anyone who does not fall away
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.760]   "on account of me."
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.540]   In other words, Jesus says, "Blessed is anyone
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.820]   "who does not fall away because I'm not acting
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.500]   "how they think that I should act,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.080]   "how they think I should be acting.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.020]   "Because I'm not doing the things that they assume
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.920]   "that, hey, if there was a God,
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.260]   "he would for sure act in this way.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.180]   "Blessed is anyone."
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.420]   And then Jesus says something that's remarkable.
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.200]   In a few verses, he says this about John.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   "Truly I tell you, among those who are born of woman,"
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.320]   that's everybody, so everyone in this room
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.400]   is born of a woman, "among those who are born of woman,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.400]   "there's never risen anyone greater than John the Baptist.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.140]   "Yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.600]   "is greater than he."
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.860]   That Jesus responds to his cousin who sits there
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.420]   and who had this overwhelming boldness,
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.900]   he's the one who's now finding himself
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.800]   in incredible doubt of, man, maybe he's not, I don't know.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.520]   And he responds and he says,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.900]   "John the Baptist is the greatest person who's ever lived."
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.220]   That even John, the greatest person in Jesus,
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.220]   I mean, Jesus just said, hey, this dude's the GOAT.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.100]   And even the GOAT, greatest of all time,
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.860]   not Tom Brady, not Jordan, not David in the Old Testament,
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.840]   not the old prophets, he says,
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.020]   "There's never been anyone greater than my cousin John."
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.300]   Think about that.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.780]   There's never been anybody greater.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.880]   And even the greatest of all time
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.540]   struggled with doubt in his moment of need.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:52.580]   Doubt does not disqualify a person's faith.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.580]   Doubt is a part of any true faith
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.400]   that you're gonna experience.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.980]   Doubt is normal, our first point,
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.060]   for even the greatest people of faith.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.480]   And John the Baptist, who Jesus says,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.760]   "There's never been anyone greater
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.860]   "when he found himself in a place
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.260]   "where he didn't like how God was not intervening,
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.600]   "where he didn't like the story
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.680]   "that was being written in his life,
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.960]   "he begins to doubt."
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.660]   And Jesus says, man, even the greatest
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.540]   experienced doubt in your life.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.780]   If you struggle with doubt
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.940]   or if you've ever struggled with doubt,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.860]   man, if you read the Bible,
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.580]   you will find good and great comfort and encouragement
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.460]   because all throughout it,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.060]   there's people who struggle with doubt.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.480]   Every single one of Jesus's followers struggled with doubt.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.380]   Every single one of his 12 disciples struggled with doubt,
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.300]   from Peter to John to Andrew,
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.540]   all of them struggled to believe
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.720]   that, man, is this really true?
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.660]   Is Jesus really who he says he was?
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.780]   And they struggled after they saw him walk on water,
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.140]   after they saw him feed 5,000,
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.340]   after they saw him do all these miraculous things.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.120]   In fact, dude, it's so comical.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.000]   You read Matthew chapter 28,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.100]   and we're even told that the disciples go to meet Jesus
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.420]   after he's risen from the dead
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.020]   and he's ascending into heaven.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.680]   He's floating up in the sky and he says,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.940]   "Go into all the earth and proclaim,"
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.140]   and he says, "The good commission."
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.420]   And the Bible says, Matthew 28,
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.780]   that when they saw him do this,
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.300]   out of the 11, some worshiped him.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.780]   And some doubted.
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.700]   Think about that.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.540]   They're sitting there and they're like,
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.540]   dude just came back from life,
[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.140]   he's literally floating up into the sky,
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.020]   and they're like, ah, I don't know.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.180]   I've got an uncle that does very similar stuff than this.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.700]   I'm not totally convinced here.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.620]   I mean, that's who the disciples, the 11, were.
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.700]   And if you've ever struggled with doubt,
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.100]   you find great comfort and encourage me
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.180]   because the scriptures are full of people
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.860]   who didn't have it perfectly,
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.020]   but on the journey as their faith continued to grow,
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.500]   they wrestled with doubt.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.260]   Really, the Christian life, I mean, for anybody,
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.100]   if you've met people who are like,
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   no, I've never struggled with doubt,
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.940]   I mean, you're just not telling the truth.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.860]   I can tell you, you're working on a church staff,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.500]   you experience still levels of doubt.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.180]   The Christian life is like a roller coaster.
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.220]   There's moments where you're like,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.340]   click, click, click, click, click.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.140]   We're just going up, God's taking over the world.
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.020]   He's on the king, he's the throne, he's coming back.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.260]   Nothing can stop us.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:02.820]   The none go with me, I will follow.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.620]   Click, click, click, ah, where are you, God?
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.300]   And you just find yourself on these ups and downs.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.560]   I mean, and the truth is, the more your faith grows,
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.580]   the less, hopefully, of those roller coaster rides you find,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.060]   but it's never this straight journey.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.720]   And even the greatest of all time,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.700]   Jesus said, struggled with doubt.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.100]   I know in my own life.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.780]   Dude, I read the same Bible you do.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.060]   And there's things in there that I'm like,
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.740]   huh, interesting, wow.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.960]   From Adam and Eve running around the garden naked
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.740]   talking to snakes, to Jonah in the belly of a whale
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.740]   for three days, to the sun standing still in one moment,
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.880]   to people living to be like 800 and 900 years old.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.160]   I'm like, what is that?
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.800]   What do you even look like past age 100?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.120]   Like, you just turn into Yoda?
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.260]   Is that something, or what happens?
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.680]   And I remember, especially when I first
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.080]   kind of got into ministry, and I remember being in seminary,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.520]   and I remember feeling these kind of waves of doubt,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.680]   because I was going all in on this Jesus thing.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.460]   I was like, hey, I'm hedging myself here.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.560]   I'm pot committed at this point.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.400]   I've got a Bible degree, and I'm all in,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.480]   and have I been misled here?
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.720]   I'm about to turn pro in Christianity,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   and I don't know if maybe these doubts
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.220]   are something I should listen to.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.840]   And so in the next episode I wanna look at,
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.760]   we're gonna see, I think, a key to diffusing the doubt
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.440]   in your life, or what to do whenever you experience doubt.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.000]   What to do when those doubts come in,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.920]   because it's not just blind, turn off your mind,
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.060]   don't think about that stuff, it's the opposite.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.260]   And we're gonna see it in the second episode
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.180]   we're gonna look at tonight.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.020]   And this episode takes place in John chapter six.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.180]   John chapter six, now let me set the scene.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.500]   In John chapter six, Jesus does one of his greatest miracles.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.220]   It's included in all four gospels.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.920]   There's four different accounts of the life of Jesus.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.620]   They include a lot of the same stuff.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.100]   Very few incidences are in all four of them.
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.420]   This one is, it's the feeding of the 5,000 people.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.480]   That they all were like, dude, that was amazing.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.220]   Jesus was out, he was teaching thousands of people one day.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.240]   He's teaching them, and it gets late in the day, we're told.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.760]   And Jesus looks out and he says,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.720]   "Hey, we gotta feed these people.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.980]   "They've been here a long time.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.540]   "And we don't have food trucks or food camels
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.040]   "or anything, so we need to figure out what to do."
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.080]   And he looks at his disciples and says,
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.200]   that's just unnecessary, I don't know what I'm doing with it.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.580]   And he looks at his disciples and says,
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.520]   "Hey, give them something to eat."
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.400]   And they said, "Give them something to eat?
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.600]   "We couldn't feed 5,000, I mean, estimates say 5,000 men,
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.140]   "so that's probably around 15,000 women and children,
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.120]   "up to 20."
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.900]   And they're going, what are we supposed to do?
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.340]   And so Andrew sees this kid with a lunchbox,
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.500]   and he basically is like, "Hey, give me this,
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.060]   "I gotta give it to Jesus, Jesus wants it."
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.960]   And he brings this lunchbox to Jesus,
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.180]   and it says it has some fish and a few loaves in it.
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.080]   And Jesus spreads it and tears it up,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.320]   and the bread just keeps going and going and going and going,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.000]   and they feed 5,000 men or 15,000 people that day.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.120]   And the crowd is like, oh, this is amazing.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.000]   We got a bread factory, we gotta follow this guy everywhere.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.920]   And that's what happened.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.920]   The next day, it says that they showed up
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.820]   and they're looking for Jesus and they go find him.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.600]   He like went on a boat across this lake,
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.080]   and they're like, "We're going with you."
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.440]   And they go find him over there, and he shows up,
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.040]   and they're like, "Man, where's the bread?"
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.360]   And, (laughs) it's true, it's in the Bible.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.980]   And he says something that ends with them being like,
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.320]   "I don't know if I can do this, I'm not in on that."
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.580]   And he says, "Look, I don't have bread for you today,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.300]   "but the bread that you need is not the bread
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.840]   "that's gonna satisfy you today.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.660]   "You need the bread of eternal life,
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.640]   "and I am the bread that has come down from heaven,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.360]   "and I am a provision that won't just give you
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.460]   "something to eat today.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.820]   "It will be a provision for all of eternity
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.160]   "for you to have."
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.220]   And Jesus says, "I'm the bread who's come down from heaven."
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.160]   And the crowd begins to murmur, it tells us.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.660]   Literally, in the story, it says that they're like,
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.320]   "Wait, didn't he marry a Joseph's son,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.280]   "came down from heaven?"
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.600]   He's from like four blocks over there, down from heaven.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.540]   And they begin to murmur and go,
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.600]   "I'm not sure he's who he says he is."
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.980]   And then he says something that was like,
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.860]   oh, that's a deal breaker.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.860]   He says, "Unless you eat my flesh and drink of my blood,
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.280]   "you won't be a part of this covenant."
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.000]   And the crowd is going, "Okay, time out.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.100]   "Cannibalism, really, are we going there?
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.220]   "I don't know if this is for me."
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.760]   And they kind of begin to mosey out of there.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.380]   That's what happens in this story.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.740]   They don't understand Jesus is using a metaphor saying,
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.720]   "Unless you partake in me, unless I am the source
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.020]   "and provision for your eternal life,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.400]   "then you will grow hungry again.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.360]   "You will not be a part of the everlasting covenant,"
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.480]   which is what Jesus said.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.360]   Similar to how we would talk about communion.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.560]   But the crowd doesn't understand that,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.680]   and so they just kind of slowly begin to get up,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.200]   and all of a sudden, people begin to just walk away.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.360]   And people who are following Jesus decide,
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.980]   "It's not worth it anymore.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.920]   "I'm not sure this is who he says he is,
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.480]   "and I don't understand what he's saying."
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.640]   And so here's where we pick up the story in verse 66.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.580]   Of chapter six.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.580]   "From this time, many of his disciples turn back
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.300]   "and no longer follow Jesus."
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.280]   They said, "Man, that is just too bizarre.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   "I don't understand it.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.200]   "I'm out, out on that."
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.160]   And Jesus turns to his 12,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:22.100]   kind of the 12 close disciples of the 12 apostles,
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.680]   and he asks them a question.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.020]   "You do not want to leave, too, do you?"
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.440]   And Simon Peter answered,
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.720]   and his answer gives us an antidote
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.120]   for what I think all of us have to do
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.400]   when we are in the face of doubt.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   All of us have to consider
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.480]   whenever we find ourselves experiencing any doubt.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.640]   Simon Peter answered and said,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.900]   "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.200]   "You have the words of eternal life,
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   "and we have come to believe and know
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.680]   "that you are the Holy One of God."
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.640]   Peter basically says, "Yeah, I'm uncomfortable,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.140]   "and I have no idea what you're talking about
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.380]   "with the cannibalism thing,
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.700]   "or really any of the teaching in the parables,
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.880]   "but who else are we gonna go to?
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.960]   "You alone have the words of eternal life.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.480]   "Like, if not you, then who?
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.760]   "That if we walk away from you,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.480]   "we're walking towards something,
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.180]   "and what is that something gonna be?
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.300]   "If not Jesus, then who?
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.740]   "If not Christianity, then what?"
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.120]   Peter understood that when it comes
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.880]   to surveying the world around us,
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.200]   when it comes to exploring the options
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   with Jesus or with some other belief system,
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.680]   that even with my doubts, even with my confusion,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.920]   I'm not sure what you said,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.940]   Jesus is the best option I have.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.240]   Even with your doubts,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.040]   Jesus is the best option that you have,
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.600]   'cause here's what I really wanna explore
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.620]   for just a few minutes with you.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.500]   Every single doubt, if you listen to a doubt,
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.440]   and you follow that doubt,
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.280]   and you allow it to be like,
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.740]   "Oh man, I'm not sure how people live that long,
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:00.580]   "or what they look like.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.560]   "I guess this whole thing doesn't make sense anymore."
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.400]   You are not just leaving Christianity,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.560]   you're going towards something.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.500]   All of us, every single day, are gonna wake up,
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.560]   and you will live by faith in something,
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.760]   and you are living by faith today in something,
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.660]   and in someone, regardless of whether or not you know it.
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.980]   That to walk away from Jesus
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.220]   is not to walk away from getting,
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.020]   or walk away from certainty,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.460]   or, let me say it like this,
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.460]   I can walk with Jesus with some uncertainty,
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.420]   I don't understand everything, I still have questions,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.260]   or I can walk away from him and have complete uncertainty.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.300]   The world doesn't make more sense apart from him,
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.420]   it makes less.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   And when doubts come in, you've gotta be like Peter,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.260]   and I've gotta be like Peter,
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.420]   which is be willing to say,
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.300]   "Man, I'm gonna consider the options.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.760]   "I'm looking at the options, and even with some doubt,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.140]   "this is the best option I have, Jesus."
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.460]   The idea that you're gonna live by faith,
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.660]   and I'm gonna live by faith,
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.840]   regardless of your belief, is just everywhere.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.060]   I mean, let's talk about some of the major world beliefs,
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.520]   or religions, maybe we'll just start with atheism.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.620]   Maybe you've called yourself an agnostic,
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.660]   or you have friends and family
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.300]   who are agnostic and atheism.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.860]   You have an enormous amount of faith to be an atheist.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.440]   I mean, it's just true.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.320]   To believe that the universe around us,
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.020]   atheism, there was no God, or maybe there isn't a God.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   To believe that the world, despite the fact that science,
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:28.160]   proving almost conclusively, according to Stephen Hawking,
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.120]   the universe had a beginning.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.280]   The universe isn't eternal.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.460]   And so if there was this big bang beginning
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.620]   to be an atheist, you have to say,
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.560]   "Well, nothing caused that big bang.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:38.940]   "It wasn't a big God.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.320]   "I don't know what caused it, it just kinda happened."
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.740]   You have to believe that something came from nothing.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.700]   And I know this almost seems like elementary,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.200]   that's what you have to accept at some level.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.600]   I mean, even the leading thinkers within that camp,
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.440]   if you know of Richard Dawkins,
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.120]   who's one of the leading kind of thinkers in atheism,
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.200]   has proposed that we don't know what caused the big bang.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.100]   And here's one of his leading explanations.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.080]   You can go look it up.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.680]   "Maybe aliens from another universe
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.360]   "that we've never seen before came and impregnated
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.240]   "our world, and then they just disappeared,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.400]   "and that's how it all started."
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.260]   I'm not the smartest guy in the room.
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.540]   But I think it takes more faith to believe in aliens
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.380]   who we've never seen from another universe
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.580]   that we can't track or trace to impregnate,
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.200]   whatever that means, our world,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.920]   than God creating it.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:31.420]   So you gotta have faith if you're gonna walk towards that.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.700]   Maybe you're thinking,
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.540]   well, what about the world religion of Hinduism?
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.400]   To believe without any evidence.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.300]   I mean, at least Christianity has,
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.320]   all of our faith hinges on the resurrection,
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.380]   the life and death of Jesus.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.420]   It's all about that.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.200]   The Hindu faith hinges on really an evolution
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.480]   of these teachings that have occurred
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.940]   for the last few thousand years,
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.380]   and to believe that reincarnation
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.640]   is really a result of karma,
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.320]   so depending on how you live will determine
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.520]   whether you're coming back as a mouse or a cat or you,
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.960]   and so you probably were great in the past,
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.780]   but we don't know because you can't remember anything
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.620]   from your former life.
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.200]   That includes, that requires a certain amount of faith.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.180]   To believe in Islam requires a certain amount of faith.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.900]   To believe that this experience that was had by Muhammad
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.140]   in the 600s where he had some divine encounter
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.760]   that told him to go become a warlord
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.620]   that ended up going to cities and saying,
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   "Convert or die is the one true way to God,"
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.440]   requires a certain amount of faith,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.000]   and by the way, Muhammad didn't rise from the dead.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.500]   Muhammad is buried somewhere.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.300]   To be a, probably the most common thing
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.220]   that we see inside of our world
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.940]   is honestly the most ludicrous one
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.880]   out of all the ones that I've already mentioned,
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.660]   and that's just this modern age spirituality kind of idea.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.480]   It's really the American made up God,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.340]   which is like, hey, the God who's out there,
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.560]   he loves everybody, that's just my belief,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.420]   aka my opinion, aka what I made up
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.940]   or what culture made up, and I'm accepting it,
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.100]   and God out there is love,
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.220]   and he really doesn't care how you live or what you do,
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.340]   and everybody's accepted except Hitler,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.660]   and so everything will be fine.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.900]   That's a made up God.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.620]   That's probably the most common belief in our country,
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.780]   but that's a made up God.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.820]   That is just the same.
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.660]   Listen to me, that's Zeus.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.300]   You know that, right?
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.380]   The Greeks didn't have any literature for Zeus.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:25.380]   They just kind of made him up.
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.220]   This is what he's like.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.660]   I'm sure this is great.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.940]   They made him in their image.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.580]   That's what the American God,
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.580]   who's just like, he's love out there, that's what he is.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.340]   They took the God of the Bible who says God is love,
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.580]   and they ripped the scripture
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:40.820]   and everything that they don't like
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:41.700]   about what the Bible says,
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.220]   and they just said, we'll just go with the God is love theory.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.980]   That's a made up mythology,
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.900]   and that takes an enormous amount of faith to believe.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.620]   You're gonna believe, and you will walk by faith
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.460]   whether you realize it,
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.500]   and I used to think the statement
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.540]   that's written in the Bible that,
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.820]   hey, you know, we walk by faith and not by sight.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.700]   I kind of was like uncomfortable with that,
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.060]   'cause I was like, does that mean like Christians are like,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.220]   nope, not me, I don't care about sight.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.220]   I'm more of a faith guy.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.300]   A lot of people see it to believe it.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.500]   I'm more of a believe it, don't see it thing,
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.500]   and then I realized that everyone walks by faith.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.060]   Every person that you've ever met,
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.040]   red, yellow, black, and white, they all walk by faith.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.860]   Every person you work with, interact with,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.260]   they're all walking by faith in something,
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.460]   and the Christian faith is the most rational
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.540]   of all the options.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.380]   The Christian faith, even with your doubts,
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.680]   as Peter says, man, who else are we gonna go to?
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.260]   You're the best option we got.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:39.780]   Even with your doubts is the best guy,
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.540]   because here's some big problems
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.300]   that to walk away from Jesus,
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   you have to be able to explain.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.820]   You gotta be able to reconcile inside of a world.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.660]   How do we even know the story of Christianity?
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.860]   How did Christianity even make it out of the first century?
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.380]   You ever think about this?
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.260]   The fact that today, over two billion people
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.860]   all over the planet claim to have some relationship
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.740]   with God through Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.620]   Where's Nazareth?
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.700]   It's in the armpit of the Roman Empire.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.220]   You couldn't pick it out on a map,
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.420]   and no one would ever even know it existed
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.540]   had there not been this Jewish peasant
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.580]   who is the son of a carpenter,
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.860]   who, if you're gonna explore any other belief,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.900]   you just believe, man, he was a lucky guy,
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.460]   and things just really took off for him.
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.300]   Things were going great.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.340]   He was just a man.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.700]   That's absurd.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.980]   Not only that, the narrative that,
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.900]   man, he was just a really good guy and a good prophet,
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.060]   if you read the Bible,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.220]   those aren't the words of a guy who's a really good guy
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.860]   and a good prophet and just keep the mission
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.140]   and movement alive, his teachings.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.820]   His teachings, apart from him being God
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.940]   and rising from the dead, don't make much sense.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.820]   They're not that profound.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.220]   They're not that amazing,
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.020]   apart from him being who he said he was.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.180]   In fact, they almost come off as a looney tune.
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.420]   No one would say the guy who claims to be God
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.260]   is the guy who, there's a good guy over there.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.220]   Hey, I'm God.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.180]   I love that guy.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.340]   Good guy over there.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.100]   No one would say that,
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.460]   and yet that's the claim for millions and millions of people.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.300]   How do you explain that apart from Christianity,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.100]   apart from the message of Jesus being true,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.300]   apart from the resurrection?
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.900]   How do you explain the fact that all over our world,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.600]   in different languages, on different continents,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.020]   people claim to have had an encounter with Jesus
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.660]   in a real way, and it did something to their lives?
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.700]   They began to be transformed from the inside out,
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.940]   and when you get them together,
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.740]   they speak Mandarin Chinese and they speak Farsi
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.780]   and they speak English, and you compare their stories,
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.540]   and they're eerily similar.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.260]   How do you explain the fact that this peasant movement
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:29.660]   that never should have made it out
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.220]   of the Middle East Palestine area,
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.340]   that the Roman Empire said, "We're going to stomp them out.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.520]   "We're lighting them on torches."
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.440]   The Roman Empire persecuted the heck out of them,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.460]   and eventually it exploded and spread and spread
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.260]   and exploded, not by the sword like Islam,
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.860]   but by love, and it toppled the empire,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.620]   and today, Rome is not the place
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.240]   trying to kill Christianity for a billion Catholics.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.020]   It's the epicenter of Christianity.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.460]   How do you explain that?
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.860]   You read history books that try to tell you,
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.260]   "Man, it was just, those were really compelling Christians
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.400]   "that first century, and it's ludicrous
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.000]   "apart from the resurrection."
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.540]   How do you explain men and women,
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.020]   by the hundreds who went to their deaths,
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.620]   not for what they said they believed in.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.820]   Here, listen to me.
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.740]   They didn't die for what they said they believed in.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.500]   They died for what they said they saw.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.620]   People die for what they believe in all the time.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.940]   Terrorists fly planes into buildings
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.280]   because I believe in it.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.220]   I believe in the movement.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.020]   They didn't, Christ followers did not say,
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.280]   "You know what, I believe in the movement.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.740]   "You should love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.580]   "Kill me for that."
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.680]   They said, "I saw a man die, and he went into the ground.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.760]   "He was buried, and I saw him rise again.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.640]   "You can kill me, you can do whatever you want,
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.840]   "but I'm going with the guy who comes back from the dead,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.220]   "because he said, if I trust in him,
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.420]   "I'm gonna come back from the dead,
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.940]   "and I will live for all of eternity."
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.660]   How do you explain that?
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:51.300]   This is a movement that every person on the planet today
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.620]   dated their calendar, their checkbook, their life,
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.420]   by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.540]   2018 years from, how do you explain that?
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.700]   Said that he was just some good guy from the Middle East,
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:04.880]   and they're all the same.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.020]   That is absurd.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.340]   That requires an enormous amount of faith.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.300]   It contradicts every world religion.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.300]   It contradicts the one true God.
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.920]   And even with your doubts about,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.140]   man, where were the dinosaurs?
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.020]   Christianity is the best, most rational option you got.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.420]   When I struggled with my engagement with my wife,
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.260]   what did I do?
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.020]   I went and sought answers.
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.660]   If you're struggling with doubt in the room,
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.060]   the best thing I can encourage you to do
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.380]   is to seek out answers.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.620]   What do I mean by I sought answers?
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.020]   I sat down with my community group.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.460]   I'm like, man, I'm kinda having some nervous,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.120]   I'm just filled with doubt.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.000]   Is this wrong, is it right?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.220]   Maybe I'm not supposed to marry her.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.060]   You know what they did?
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.080]   They basically sat me down and were like,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.820]   dude, you're having cold feet, you're freaking out, okay?
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.060]   Just calm down a little bit,
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.700]   and let's talk about why you're nervous.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.780]   Is there some sin you've observed in her life
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.900]   that's making you concerned?
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.020]   No, none at all.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.260]   Is there sin in your own life?
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.460]   You're not talking to people, no, not that I know of.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.660]   Is there something outstanding,
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.460]   contradicting the Bible you see in her life?
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.300]   No, not that I know of.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.140]   Then what is it?
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.660]   I'm not sure, I'm just kinda paralyzed with doubt right now.
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.720]   Maybe I'm making a mistake.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.560]   Okay, we're gonna encourage you to continue
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.040]   to just work through that,
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.660]   because it doesn't seem like these are
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.700]   thoughts that are planted from God.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.700]   Maybe they are, maybe we're wrong.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.980]   I remember JP coming along and saying,
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.340]   hey, all right, dude, so you're kinda going back and forth.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.220]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.060]   Let's pick a day.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.940]   What day do you wanna pick?
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.900]   All right, next Wednesday, next Wednesday, okay?
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.140]   Next Wednesday, we are going to put to bed
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.660]   this doubt and this kinda like, I'm worried, I'm nervous,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.460]   I'm unsure, we're just gonna put it to bed.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.980]   And so by next Wednesday, we're either gonna say,
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.940]   hey, you know what, we're gonna hit pause officially
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.180]   for a little bit, or we're gonna say,
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:48.140]   you know what, I'm done with that.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.040]   There's no reason why I need to continue living
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.020]   in this doubt right now.
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.040]   So next Wednesday, you freak out,
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.380]   worry all you want between now and then,
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.700]   but Wednesday is D-Day, so we'll make the decision.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.540]   And that was like profoundly hopeful for me.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.260]   It was kinda like, oh, we'll explore it,
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.660]   and I guess there isn't anything here.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.940]   And for whatever reason, it was like,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.100]   I'm putting that to bed, and I'm moving on.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.000]   It wasn't that I was unwilling to acknowledge reason
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.900]   or to explore, to seek answers,
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.580]   but there wasn't anything outstanding.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.020]   It just was some nerves in my own heart.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.420]   Some of you, you need to seek answers
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.340]   and to continue to find clarity
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.760]   if there's parts of you that are doubting.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.040]   There's a website called gotquestions.org,
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.280]   gotquestions.org, could not recommend it highly enough.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.960]   You can type in almost any question you want.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.440]   They've got millions and millions of questions
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.880]   that are there.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.240]   And get biblical answers
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.020]   that will help answer some of those things.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.560]   Maybe you have friends that may have questions,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.520]   and that could be a resource too.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.920]   But then there's this other group in the room.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.320]   And this is probably what I think most people
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.960]   in our age demographic are in.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.760]   And our doubts in this group are less like,
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.360]   man, I'm just not sure that it's true.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.280]   And they're more in the category of,
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   I'm not sure I want it to be true,
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.600]   at least not yet, if you will.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.260]   I'm not sure that I want it to be true.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.720]   Because if the Bible is really true,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.480]   if Jesus really did rise,
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.000]   I might have to change some things.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And I don't know that I'm wanting to do that.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.840]   And so I'd rather kind of just live
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.280]   in ignorance as bliss right now,
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.160]   'cause if it's true,
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.400]   I might have to stop sleeping with my boyfriend.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.060]   If it's true, I might have to break up with her.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.120]   If it's true, man, I might be in an occupation
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.040]   that I'm not supposed to be in.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.840]   If it's true, I may not be able to smoke weed
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.880]   the way that I've been smoking weed.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.880]   If it's true, I may need to change some habits
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.840]   or change some of my people that I run with.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.240]   I may have to like, it may mess my life up.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.080]   I'm not sure I want it to be true,
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.120]   like at least not yet.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.600]   You know, like someday, kind of once I'm past my 20s,
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.640]   then I for sure, you know, I'm gonna get in church
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.720]   and you know, we're gonna get a minivan
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.240]   and take the kids to church and it's gonna be great.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.900]   But right now, I'm not sure that I even want it to be true.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.900]   Let me tell you the danger in that.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.880]   The best way I know to explain it would be this.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.000]   Have you ever had that feeling or that experience where,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.800]   and I'm asking for a friend here,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.040]   you're like buying something and you're like,
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.640]   I don't know how much I have left
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.280]   in my bank account right now.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.280]   I'm not even sure that I really wanna look this week
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.000]   or today or anytime soon.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.240]   I'll just, it'll be fine, you know.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.960]   I've got some credit in there, it'll be great.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.520]   And you kind of like operate in this like,
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.600]   I'll look but not till next week
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.480]   'cause it's a little depressing every time I do.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.560]   And you have that experience where you're like,
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.040]   I wanna know the truth, just not quite yet, right now.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.880]   And the danger there is, man, as you do that,
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.440]   you're not making responsible decisions,
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.080]   you end up increasing the debt that you have.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.980]   And it ends up costing you either way.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.060]   In the same way, unlike a bank account
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.540]   where maybe you get a bonus
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.300]   or something you can pay it off easily,
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.180]   when you and I continue to reject the truth,
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.860]   not live with the truth, you're not racking up debt,
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.540]   you are racking up damage to your life.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.180]   You're racking up dysfunctional habits
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.100]   that don't just go away.
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.540]   Alcohol, and when you continue to just abuse alcohol,
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.180]   that doesn't just go away, that becomes alcoholism.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:17.100]   Pornography, if you continue to just indulge
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.380]   in pornography, that's not something that's going away.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.060]   You are continuing to create a habit inside of your life.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.660]   If you continue to live in a way
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.540]   that's outside of God's will, you're not racking up debt,
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.940]   you are damaging your life, you are missing out
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.500]   on experiencing your 20s, the life you wanna have,
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.860]   the life God wants you to experience.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:36.480]   And you're hiding behind, let's be honest,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.140]   just smoke screens, you're like,
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.340]   I just kinda wanna claim I don't know
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.100]   because I honestly don't even know that I want to know.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.900]   And it's a smoke screen.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.900]   And in the end, it's only gonna cost you.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.740]   And it's only gonna bring damage to you
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:56.740]   in a way that no amount of when I get the next check,
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.500]   I can just pay it off, is gonna be able to take care of.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:05.420]   In the meantime, the question all of us have to wrestle
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.200]   is if not Jesus, then who?
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.700]   If not Christianity, then what?
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.780]   Because you're gonna walk by faith
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.180]   and you're gonna live by faith,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.780]   whether you realize it or not.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.500]   The question is, will you be honest enough
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.860]   with yourself to admit it?
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.540]   And then the third episode that we see
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.060]   in this trilogy of interactions with Jesus,
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.140]   with people who struggle with doubt,
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.900]   comes in John chapter 20.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.580]   And what I wanna just pull out from this text
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:38.000]   is the simple truth that Jesus can handle your doubt.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.200]   Jesus can handle your doubt.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.940]   The doubt is normal for even the greatest of faith,
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.460]   we said point one, even with doubts,
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.340]   Christ is your best option.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.220]   And that Jesus, no matter what that doubt is,
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.260]   Jesus can handle your doubt.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.620]   This story comes from John chapter 20.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.260]   And this is one of the most famous interactions
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.300]   Jesus has with someone who experienced doubt.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.340]   And this was a dude who ended up getting a nickname.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.880]   His nickname was Doubting Thomas.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.260]   That's right.
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.740]   Five of you know this story.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.260]   So for the rest of you, here's what happened.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:10.620]   Thomas was one of the 12 disciples.
[00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.420]   Thomas was one of Jesus's followers.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.160]   And in John chapter 20, it's shortly after Jesus
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.900]   died on the cross, rose from the dead, came back alive,
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.840]   and he began showing up and appearing to people.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.260]   And this is blowing people's mind
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.940]   'cause people don't come back from the dead very often,
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:24.780]   or ever.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.980]   And so people are like, man, I saw Jesus.
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.460]   And Jesus is showing up to different people,
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.640]   shows up to Mary Magdalene, shows up to another Mary,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.140]   his mother, shows up to 11 of the disciples.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.840]   And Thomas is not home.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:42.380]   Thomas had gone to the grocery store to get something
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.060]   and so Thomas was the only one of the disciples
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:44.880]   who was not home.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.380]   And Jesus shows up and he's in the room
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.740]   and he allows the 11 disciples,
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.140]   hey, you can touch my hands, you can see me, look at me,
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.800]   it's me, I've risen from the dead, peace be with you.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.260]   And Thomas comes back and they begin to tell him,
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.980]   man, we saw Jesus and here's what happens.
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.040]   John chapter 20, verse 24.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.100]   Now Thomas, who was also known as Didymus,
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.140]   was one of the 12, was not with the disciples
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.160]   when Jesus came.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:15.800]   So the other disciples told him, we have seen the Lord.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.220]   But he said to them, unless I see the nail marks
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.860]   in his hands and I put my finger where the nails were
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   and I put my hand in his side, I will not believe.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.620]   Thomas gets a bad rap.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.660]   Thomas feels like just an honest dude to me.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.100]   I mean, if I'm in the room right now
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.780]   and I've never seen someone rise from the dead,
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.020]   I feel like that's pretty reasonable.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.060]   You're like, yeah, hey man, when I see it,
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.160]   I will definitely believe it.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.460]   I'm gonna take your word,
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.140]   but you guys are not the brightest group
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:44.980]   in the whole bunch here.
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:47.260]   So when I see it, I'll believe it.
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.180]   And here's what happens next.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.340]   A week later, his disciples were in the house again
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.220]   and Thomas was with them this time.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.680]   Though the doors were locked,
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.300]   Jesus came and stood among them,
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.260]   which is like a total gangster move.
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.260]   Just like, I'm gonna walk through the walls right here.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.020]   I'm Jesus, how are you?
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.560]   And he said, peace be with you
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.940]   because they probably were terrified
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.580]   if somebody walks through a wall.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.820]   That's a real deal right there.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.660]   And he walks through the wall, he says,
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.260]   "Peace be with you, don't be afraid."
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.980]   And then he looked at Thomas
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.020]   and what would you expect him to say?
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.660]   "Thomas, you doubted me.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.660]   "I'm done with you, bye Felicia.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.260]   "It's over."
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:38.820]   That's not what he said.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.320]   This is the message version.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.160]   And...
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.560]   It's not true.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.120]   And the message is great.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.380]   Whatever Bible you'll read.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.800]   "Thomas," he said,
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:55.840]   "put your finger here and see my hands.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.500]   "Reach your hand out and put it in my side.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.840]   "Stop doubting and believe."
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.380]   That's amazing to me.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:09.140]   How much humility does it take
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.720]   for the God of the universe to say,
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.580]   man, he didn't believe, I'll prove myself to you.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:17.120]   You wanna come here and you wanna touch the hands,
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.420]   touch the holes, Thomas.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.800]   He didn't say, "Thomas, I'm done with you.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.640]   "I can't believe you."
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.260]   Man, unbelievable.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.100]   Who do you think you are?
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.900]   He said, "Thomas, come, you can come see for yourself.
[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.780]   "It's me, it's Jesus.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.180]   "I rose just like I said I would."
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.960]   Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God."
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.640]   Over and over the Bible, side note,
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.880]   paints a picture that Jesus didn't claim to be a man,
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.060]   he claimed to be God.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.160]   And everyone who believed him, died for him,
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.920]   followed him, believed that he was.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.360]   Then Jesus told him,
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.900]   "Because you have seen me, you have believed,
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.960]   "but blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe."
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.760]   That's you if you're a follower of Jesus.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.100]   What Jesus displays here is that he can handle your doubts.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.700]   He didn't chastise Thomas, he allows him,
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.200]   "Hey, you want more evidence?
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.800]   "Come seek more evidence."
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.820]   He moves towards Thomas in compassion
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.480]   that Jesus can handle your doubts.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.860]   If you're someone who has doubts,
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.000]   he's not disregarding you, he's not done with you
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.200]   that doesn't disqualify you.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.060]   He moves in your direction like he did with Thomas.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.500]   If you're someone who has sincere doubts in the room,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.760]   I wanna invite you and I wanna ask,
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.500]   I wanna challenge you really to do something.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.340]   If you're someone who's like,
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.880]   "Man, I'm just not, I'm trying as hard as I can,
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.860]   "but I'm just not there yet.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.320]   "I'm not even sure God exists.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.360]   "I'm not sure this whole Christianity thing is true.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.840]   "I wanna be there, I just can't get there.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.700]   "It works for everyone else, I just can't get there."
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.260]   I wanna encourage and challenge you to do something.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.780]   I just want you to pray something this week
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.620]   for the next seven days.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.180]   God, if you're real, will you show yourself to me?
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   God, if you're real, I wanna know you,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.780]   will you reveal yourself to me?
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.520]   God, if you're real, will you reveal yourself to me?
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:10.340]   You may be honestly too afraid to pray that prayer
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.020]   'cause you're afraid you might actually do it.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.260]   But if you're sincere, if you want to know him,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.580]   I wanna challenge you to pray that prayer.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.500]   God, if you're real, will you reveal yourself to me?
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.540]   Because here's what I know about you,
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:23.100]   here's what I know about every single person in the room.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.540]   You want to know God.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.380]   Like if the God who's there is real, you wanna know him.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.980]   You want to know him even more than you want answers
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.860]   to the questions you have.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.700]   Think about that.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.540]   Thomas wanted to know him more than he wanted to know
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.700]   answers to his questions.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.300]   I mean, when Jesus shows up, Thomas is not like,
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.620]   "Oh man, yeah, I really have to explore here.
[00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.380]   "Let me see those hands, give me that thing.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:46.220]   "Is it really Jesus?
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.940]   "Oh, I open up, ah."
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.380]   He goes, "He's the one,
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.380]   "I don't need to explore anything more."
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:54.100]   Thomas wanted to know him more than he wanted no answer.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:54.980]   I know that's true for you.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.480]   Here's how further I know it.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.660]   If Jesus or God was to appear to you tonight
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.260]   inside of your room, if you're someone who's like,
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:02.460]   "I've just got questions, I've got doubts,
[00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.340]   "I'm kind of a skeptic by nature."
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.900]   If he showed up in your room tonight,
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.660]   here's what I'm confident would not happen.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.860]   Jesus stands in front of you, "Hey, it's me, I'm Jesus.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:11.740]   "It's true, I'm God."
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.860]   You wouldn't be like, "Hold on, let me get my list.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.420]   "Okay, let's start from the top.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.580]   "Noah, huh, how did he fit the animals on the ark?
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.420]   "That's what I wanna know."
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.340]   You'd be like, "Oh my gosh, it's real."
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.580]   Your questions would all kind of shrink to the side.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.020]   You'd be like, "Ah, we'll figure that out.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.100]   "You're real, it's true."
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.920]   Because you, every person in this room,
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.780]   you wanna know him more than you want answers
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.620]   to your question.
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.460]   And so if you are a person, you're wrestling with those,
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.960]   I just wanna challenge you to pray.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:42.340]   God, if you're real, will you reveal yourself to me?
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:44.280]   I wanna know you, I want answers to my questions,
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.780]   but I wanna know you more than I want answers
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.600]   to my questions.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.080]   Will you show yourself to me in an undeniable way?
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   I believe that's a prayer that he will answer.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.700]   And so this week, for the next seven days,
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.420]   you owe it to yourself, because if he's there,
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:03.080]   you want to know him even more than you want answers
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.640]   to your questions.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.820]   The second thing I would challenge you to do
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.580]   is to seek answers.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:10.280]   There's libraries written on the questions you may have,
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.120]   truly.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.980]   My guess is maybe you are the one exception
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.500]   in the whole world history that's gonna come up
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.740]   with the one question that's like,
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.300]   "Ah, that's a stumper."
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.140]   Even God, not sure on that one.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.300]   But for most of us, the questions that you have
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.980]   about like, you know, how old is the earth?
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.920]   All those different questions are great.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.020]   Ask them, seek answers on them.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.820]   Don't just live in the fog of doubt.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:40.300]   In conclusion, what we see is that doubt happens
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.860]   even to the greatest of faith,
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.620]   that even with doubts, Christ is your best option,
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.200]   and that Jesus can handle your doubts,
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.040]   wherever you are in that journey.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.740]   I'll close here.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.900]   I was thinking today, and I was thinking about,
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.800]   man, had I allowed those doubts to rule my life,
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.100]   the doubts with my relationship with my wife,
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.900]   how much would I have missed out on?
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.460]   Like, how different would my life have been
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:13.220]   if I was not able to kind of get over doubts,
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.580]   that I wasn't able to move forward,
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.540]   and I just allowed those things to be in the driver's seat,
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.040]   and I can't move forward in this relationship?
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.380]   I probably wouldn't have been able to move forward
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.820]   in any single relationship.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.740]   Had I allowed those doubts that really were just,
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.660]   that there weren't any really good reason for them,
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.300]   how I'd allowed those things to rule my life,
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.660]   how different would my life have been,
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:29.980]   how much would I have missed out on?
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.720]   Well, I can tell you.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.700]   I would have missed out on the last six years,
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.740]   being married to one of the godliest people I know.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.660]   I would have missed out on some of the best six years
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:40.500]   of my life.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.680]   I would have missed out on seeing the birth of two children.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   They wouldn't exist.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.980]   A two-and-a-half-year-old son,
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.680]   and a nine-day-old or something like that daughter.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.700]   Yeah, I know, we're not sleeping.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.540]   We can keep going.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.860]   (audience applauding)
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.700]   (laughing)
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.260]   Thanks, golf clap for that.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.940]   I would have missed out on all kinds of different things.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.820]   It's clear, I know what I would have missed out on.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:02.980]   Here's what you're gonna miss out on
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.340]   if you allow doubt to take you out.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.120]   If you allow doubt to be something that you don't,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.860]   that rules your life, rather than saying,
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:10.420]   man, Christ is gonna rule my life.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.540]   If you allow your doubts, you don't seek out answers,
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.100]   you just hide behind the smoke screen,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.980]   you hide behind, not yet, I don't wanna give this up yet,
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.340]   I'm not sure it's worth it to follow Jesus,
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.240]   I'm not sure I want it to be true yet.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.080]   If you allow doubt to rule your life,
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.640]   you are gonna miss out on peace,
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.860]   you are gonna miss out on purpose and meaning.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.980]   Those are things that are only found in knowing Jesus.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.880]   You're gonna miss out on the only level of satisfaction
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.800]   you're gonna find inside of this life.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.760]   You're gonna spend your life trying to fill a hole
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.460]   inside of you that no amount of money, pleasure,
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.400]   alcohol, sex, people, anything could fill
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.240]   because it was a hole that was put there by God,
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.600]   and it was put there so that you would reach out to know him.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.340]   You're gonna miss out on knowing the one true God,
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.820]   you're gonna miss out on the peace that comes of knowing,
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.980]   I know where I'm gonna go when I die.
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.740]   You're gonna miss out on the only rational explanation
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:01.840]   for the world around us that I think that there is.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.900]   And you can either choose to kind of live in the shadows
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.420]   of, you know, we can't really know and I'm an agnostic,
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.700]   but you're living by faith, friend,
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.300]   and your faith is not anchored in a person who came
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.220]   and died on a cross 2,000 years ago,
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:15.260]   who entered into history.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.560]   It's not anchored in a book that has over and over again
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.480]   proven to be consistent with the world around us,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.720]   with historical facts, it's not anchored in any of that stuff,
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.220]   it's anchored in your opinion.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:30.880]   And you're a much, you're a much more arrogant person
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.160]   if you think that your own opinion of the world
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.960]   suffices to explain everything.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.400]   The rest of us, man, we acknowledge that if there's a God
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.880]   who's there, he's probably even bigger than our own minds
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.720]   could ever comprehend or understand.
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.700]   And I'm gonna humbly, willingly accept the rational faith
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.220]   that is there or I'm gonna continue living
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.280]   behind the smoke screen, allow doubt to take me out.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.880]   And if that happens, it's gonna cost you
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.560]   and you will miss out on the life you want,
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.420]   the life God wants for you, the abundant life
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.580]   you were created to experience, let me pray.
[00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:11.820]   Father, I pray for friends in this room right now
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.940]   who have sincere doubts, who are unsure
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.120]   about whether or not you're real,
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.480]   that you would move them to pray.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.900]   God, if you're real, will you show yourself to me?
[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.020]   And you would answer that prayer.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.260]   Father, I pray for those who are living
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:30.640]   behind a smoke screen.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:35.120]   They don't have sincere doubts, they just aren't a place
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.740]   where they don't wanna know, they don't wanna change,
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.300]   they're afraid of what it's gonna cost them,
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.700]   that you would grab a hold of their hearts,
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.180]   that they would come to a place where they believe
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.260]   you're not here to rip 'em off, you're God.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.320]   You don't need anything from them,
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:51.700]   you desire something for them,
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.600]   and they would believe and accept that.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.100]   Father, thank you for the fact that you're patient
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.260]   with our doubts, you can handle our doubts.
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:01.140]   We worship you now in song, amen.
