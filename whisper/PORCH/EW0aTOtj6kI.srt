1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,840
 Let's go.

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,760
 Hey, welcome friends in the room.

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
 Now we can clap for that.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,560
 Friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso,

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,180
 Cedar Rapids, Spring, wherever you are joining

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,680
 or listening from as we continue this series,

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,520
 Abuse on the Porch.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,720
 Hey, quick PSA, tonight's topic is a little bit,

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,440
 is a mature content, so if you have children

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,400
 with you in the room, this would probably be a good time

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,040
 to head to Sonic or some other place.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,960
 Or if you're listening at a future date,

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,100
 this would be a time for you to probably hit pause

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,200
 and listen to it yourself.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,680
 I'm gonna start with a little bit of a story.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,480
 Recently, I have been in preparation for a talk

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,800
 that we may give at a future date inside of this series

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,240
 or at least at some point in the porch

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,120
 in a number of different conversations

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 that I've recognized that as I sit in just kind of a circle

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,520
 and have these conversations,

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,100
 a heightened sensitivity as I approach it.

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,760
 And it's a conversation about race.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,000
 Race is a huge issue inside of our culture right now.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,800
 And just the conversation about how does the church

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,880
 play a role in bringing healing to an area

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,340
 where it seems like society is further getting divided

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,440
 and how do we be a part of that?

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,880
 And just as I've sat kind of in conversations

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,500
 in circles with people and we just try to listen

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
 to one another and talk through how does the church

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,040
 play an active role in bringing this conversation about

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,860
 in a healthy way, I've just recognized like a sensitivity

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,120
 around it where I just, I wanna make sure that I'm not,

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,520
 by the questions that I ask, even the terms that I use,

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,140
 either being invalidating or insulting

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,160
 and at the same time that I recognize

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,240
 and care for those who are there.

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,800
 And I think the reason why is twofold.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
 One, I don't know if you can tell, I'm white

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,920
 and like extra white, like I get sunburn indoors.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,400
 And so there's that and so I wanna make sure that this,

44
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
 you know, I wanna learn from different perspectives.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,460
 I think it's something that if the body of Christ

46
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,420
 can't learn to listen and hear different perspectives

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,940
 and care for one another, who can?

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,460
 And so I wanna be sensitive to that.

49
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,680
 And then the other reason I think there's a sensitivity

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,780
 to make sure that the tenderness around that topic

51
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,660
 and just the handling of that topic is done really well

52
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,180
 is because historically, the church has not always

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,180
 done really well about that topic.

54
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,980
 And so I wanna make sure that we are

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,220
 allowing the spirit of God to continue to create unity

56
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,500
 and just handling it really well.

57
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,920
 I say all that because in the same way,

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,920
 I feel that way about tonight's topic.

59
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,360
 That it's one of those really emotionally charged things

60
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,840
 that is a part of the conversation often in culture

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,080
 and it's a conversation that has not always been one

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,860
 the church has handled well.

63
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,400
 Tonight, we're gonna talk about the subject

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
 of homosexuality.

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
 Last week, we dove into, hey, what does the Bible say

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
 about premarital sex?

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,080
 And tonight, we're gonna open up the conversation

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,600
 about what does the Bible say about homosexuality,

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,100
 specifically addressing the question of can you be gay

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,820
 or lesbian and be a Christian?

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,560
 And I know that this is not some political exercise

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,760
 that we're gonna have.

73
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,920
 This is a personal issue for many people in the room.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,480
 Either it's something that same-sex attraction

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,880
 is something you personally have wrestled with

76
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,100
 or you may know someone, a family member, a brother.

77
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,240
 And so this isn't some abstract idea.

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,680
 This is a person that is connected to many of us

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,440
 inside of the room.

80
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,940
 I know I've personally sat with friends who no longer,

81
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,720
 having once attended here or church in general,

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,720
 won't come back because of the issue of homosexuality.

83
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,720
 And the church historically has not always handled it well.

84
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,160
 There have been things done in the name of Jesus

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,520
 that were evil or they were ostracizing

86
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,840
 and they certainly were unloving and unchrist-like.

87
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,800
 And yet at the same time, we live in a world

88
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,140
 that is continuing to move further and further away

89
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,460
 from God's word.

90
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,100
 And so how do we maintain whatever the Bible says,

91
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,040
 which we're gonna explore tonight,

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,760
 and also where can the church continue to take ground

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,000
 at an issue that seems to be on the fault line

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,500
 of our culture or just at the forefront

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,060
 of so much of the conversation?

96
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,400
 This has been used in a way

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,360
 I don't think it was ever intended to be, to hit people.

98
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,400
 Or God didn't give it to us to beat people with.

99
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,900
 He gave it to us in order that we would find life.

100
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,280
 And so tonight, I'm gonna do as best I can

101
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,520
 to approach this subject in a way

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,080
 that I hope represents God's heart and God's word.

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
 I know that I'm gonna fail.

104
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,680
 This is one of those subjects where at the end of the night,

105
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,920
 you always regret, man, I wish I would have said this better.

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
 I wish I would have said that more clearly.

107
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,320
 And so I fully expect and am well aware of the infallible

108
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,620
 or the shortcomings that my communication may have.

109
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,280
 But as best we can, I wanna explore alongside of you

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,240
 what God's word says about the subject

111
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,800
 of what it looks like to be gay or to be lesbian.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,640
 So we're gonna look specifically at three questions.

113
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,520
 Can you be gay and be a Christian?

114
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,880
 Why or why not?

115
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,140
 And how the church must change on this issue.

116
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,480
 So let's talk about the first one.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,740
 Can you be gay and be a Christian?

118
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,280
 Well, immediately it becomes a question

119
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,240
 of what do you mean by gay?

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,840
 If by gay, you mean someone who has homosexual

121
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,800
 or same-sex attraction, gay or lesbian,

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,840
 I'm using interchangeably there.

123
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
 If by that, you just mean you're talking

124
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,400
 about attraction, yes or sure.

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,000
 In other words, it's not homosexuality

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,660
 or homosexual attraction that will stop you

127
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,600
 from being a Christian and any more

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,980
 than heterosexual attraction makes you be a Christian.

129
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,600
 You can have temptation and that's not a sin.

130
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,560
 Homosexual attraction is not a sin.

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,460
 Being tempted in a same-sex manner is not a sin.

132
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,260
 But if by being gay, you mean homosexual actions,

133
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,520
 the Bible is a little bit, not a little bit,

134
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
 it's a lot more clear.

135
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,160
 Here's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6.

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,140
 Do not be deceived.

137
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,400
 This comes from verse nine.

138
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,980
 Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters,

139
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
 nor adulterers, nor men who have sex with men,

140
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,040
 or it's just the word homosexuality

141
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,760
 your translation may have, nor thieves,

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,920
 nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers,

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,560
 nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

144
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,000
 Paul, are you saying that being gay

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,040
 will keep you out of heaven?

146
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,040
 What Paul is saying is that having unrepentant sin

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,600
 in your life of any kind that you just embrace

148
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,440
 is not the mark of someone who's a member

149
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,020
 of the kingdom of heaven.

150
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,600
 I mean, we can zoom in on homosexuality.

151
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,100
 He really says, man, if you look at God's word

152
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,520
 and you embrace sexual immorality,

153
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,040
 which is sleeping with anyone other than a spouse,

154
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,920
 if you embrace idolatry, which is any time

155
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
 that we put anything before God,

156
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,540
 and that is an unrepentant lifestyle that you had,

157
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,440
 that's not the mark of someone who is a follower of Jesus.

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,940
 And so any unrepentant sin that someone embraces

159
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,200
 and tolerates, Paul would say, that's the mark of someone

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,440
 who doesn't know God, or at least is certainly

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,400
 not walking with him and is very deceived.

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
 And here's like the rub on this issue,

163
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,920
 and let's be honest.

164
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,640
 The biggest issue inside of the room from this list

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,880
 is not homosexual sin.

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,800
 There's a lot more heterosexual sin

167
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
 that's taking place inside of this room.

168
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,320
 I mean, Paul would say, hey, can you be an unrepentant person

169
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,020
 who's sleeping with your boyfriend

170
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,840
 and be a member of the kingdom of heaven?

171
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,800
 Someone who's like, look, I know what God's word says.

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,940
 I know that that's not okay.

173
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,080
 I just don't care.

174
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
 And you know, it's not that big of a deal.

175
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
 I'm sure God will accept me.

176
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,480
 I think Paul would say, you should be concerned.

177
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,080
 If you have homosexual sin, you're just saying,

178
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,760
 I'm embracing, I don't care what God says.

179
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,580
 You should be concerned.

180
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,600
 You're a gossip.

181
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,440
 And you're like, look, it's not that big of a deal.

182
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,820
 It's kind of, we bond over it.

183
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,880
 I know God's word says it's bad, but I really don't care.

184
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,680
 You should be concerned.

185
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,720
 If you live for the weekend, you live for the party,

186
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,600
 the next high, and you're like, man,

187
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,680
 I know God really is not for that,

188
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,200
 but it's not that big of a deal.

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,400
 You only live once, and someday I'll get more serious.

190
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,560
 You should be concerned.

191
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
 Paul would say, those are not the characteristics

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,480
 of someone who's a member of the kingdom of heaven.

193
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,900
 Said another way, who has Jesus as the king of their heart

194
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,260
 and their life, because Jesus is the king

195
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,820
 of the kingdom of heaven.

196
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,740
 And so can someone be gay and be a Christian?

197
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,060
 If by gay, you mean sexual orientation

198
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,020
 or attracted to the same sex, yes.

199
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,400
 And they can also not be.

200
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,940
 It hinges around whether or not they have trusted in Christ

201
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,420
 as the payment for their sin and the resurrection

202
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,420
 that he came back alive, and they've trusted in that.

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,120
 But can someone live an unrepentant, sinful lifestyle

204
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,120
 and embrace sin that Jesus, as the king, has said,

205
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,940
 is not to be a part of the people of God,

206
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,280
 which is any type of the sins.

207
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,460
 He lists out a whole bunch of them.

208
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,040
 There's nothing distinct about homosexual sin.

209
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,180
 Paul would say, no.

210
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,740
 Or they should at least be concerned,

211
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,700
 because that is not characteristic of the people

212
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,900
 who are the members of the kingdom of heaven.

213
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,940
 Homosexual behavior, not homosexual attraction,

214
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,640
 is sin, according to the Bible.

215
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,580
 Well, doesn't Jesus say that we're not to judge?

216
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,740
 This would be a response you often hear

217
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,820
 inside of culture, that hey, we're to judge not, right?

218
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
 Didn't Jesus say judge not?

219
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,360
 So we shouldn't judge.

220
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,140
 Jesus didn't say not to judge.

221
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,500
 He tells us how to judge and who to judge.

222
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,260
 If you read in Matthew chapter seven,

223
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,500
 you go and you read it, Jesus says, hey,

224
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,860
 do not judge to a standard that you don't wanna

225
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,700
 be held to.

226
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,420
 He says basically, hey, to the measure that you judge

227
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,720
 someone, you're gonna be held to that standard.

228
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,780
 You need to know this.

229
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,240
 And then he goes into an explanation of how we are

230
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
 to judge someone.

231
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
 He literally says, hey, take the plank out of your eye,

232
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,580
 then you can look at a speck in your brother's.

233
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,980
 The Bible doesn't teach not to judge.

234
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,300
 It tells us who to judge and how to judge.

235
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,020
 First Corinthians chapter five, that's another letter.

236
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,260
 Paul writes, and he says, you are to judge one another.

237
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,900
 By judge, hold one another accountable

238
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,420
 to the standards of God's word.

239
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,240
 That's what it teaches.

240
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,140
 It doesn't teach, hey, judge not, you know,

241
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,100
 only God can judge me.

242
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,200
 It says that we're to hold one another accountable

243
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
 to the standards inside of God's word.

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,180
 It would be impossible for you not to judge.

245
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,140
 And here's what I mean by that,

246
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,320
 or make judgments on things.

247
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,220
 All of us come into the room and we all hold judgments.

248
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,720
 We all hold things that we believe that are wrong.

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,380
 You probably came into the room and you're like,

250
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,420
 I think that

251
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,820
 child abuse is wrong.

252
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,640
 That's a judgment.

253
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,740
 Who are you to judge?

254
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,260
 We're all fine with that type of judgment.

255
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,820
 The Bible is fine with that type of judgment

256
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,780
 'cause that's evil.

257
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,140
 We all came in there, or many of us came in the room.

258
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,860
 I'd say most of us, hopefully,

259
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,900
 came in and said, hey, racism is wrong.

260
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,220
 It's an evil atrocity and it's not okay.

261
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,160
 That's a judgment.

262
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,620
 The Bible doesn't teach not to judge.

263
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,900
 It teaches us who to judge and how to judge in love,

264
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,260
 brothers and sisters in Christ alongside of us.

265
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,140
 Another response people will say is, hey, you know,

266
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,620
 Jesus never specifically addresses this issue.

267
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,020
 Why didn't he bring it up?

268
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,420
 The reality is Jesus does address

269
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,660
 the idea of marriage repeatedly.

270
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,020
 And he says it's between one man and one wife for life.

271
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,220
 'Til death do they part.

272
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,620
 He says this is the standard of marriage.

273
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,540
 And he literally says, if you can't accept this,

274
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,620
 you should not get married.

275
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,660
 But this is what marriage is.

276
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,500
 And you may be thinking, yeah,

277
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,300
 but he didn't specifically address homosexual behavior.

278
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,620
 What's the big deal?

279
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,540
 If the standard of what is okay and not okay

280
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,720
 is what Jesus doesn't, or Jesus explicitly addresses,

281
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,560
 I mean, let's be honest,

282
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,340
 there's a lot of things he doesn't address.

283
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,100
 He didn't address wife beating.

284
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,180
 But I don't think any of us are like,

285
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,460
 I think he was pro-wife beating.

286
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,500
 He doesn't address heroin.

287
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,740
 I don't know that anyone's like,

288
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,780
 yeah, he's a big heroin guy.

289
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,860
 I think everyone would say, no,

290
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
 I don't think he'd be okay with that.

291
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,980
 But he clearly lays out that Jesus' perspective on marriage

292
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,260
 and what God's design was,

293
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,740
 was between one man and one woman for life.

294
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,500
 That's what Jesus says about the conversation

295
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,860
 of what marriage is.

296
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,220
 In Romans chapter one, Paul makes abundantly clear

297
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,300
 that homosexual behavior

298
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,380
 is contrary to God's design for the world.

299
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,460
 That God is the creator.

300
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,060
 You can go read it later in Romans chapter one,

301
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,420
 where Paul lays out in verses 25

302
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,820
 through the end of the chapter

303
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,100
 that God created the world,

304
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,120
 he designed the world to work in a certain way.

305
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,040
 And when man chases after sin,

306
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,260
 they reject the creator's design.

307
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,100
 And they say, I know better than you.

308
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,940
 And they run towards destruction.

309
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,060
 He gives a ton of different sins that man runs to

310
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,580
 when we reject God,

311
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,480
 when we reject the creator or the designer.

312
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,940
 And we say, you created it, but we know better.

313
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,980
 You run towards, you don't know how to handle this life,

314
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,820
 he would say.

315
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,640
 It doesn't just cover sexuality.

316
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,620
 He says, they reject the way that God says

317
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,340
 they should use their words, their mouth,

318
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,500
 their relationships with one another,

319
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,320
 with their parents.

320
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,580
 He goes into a whole list of things.

321
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,420
 But Paul makes clear,

322
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,480
 it is a rejection of God's created design

323
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,460
 and how he created the world to work.

324
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,460
 Anytime that we abandon the inventor

325
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,000
 or the creator's intent, the creator's instructions,

326
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,980
 things don't go well, generally speaking.

327
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,300
 I mean, I don't know, there's two people,

328
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,820
 let me illustrate it this way.

329
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,980
 There's two types of people in this room right now.

330
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,860
 There are people who, when you are doing laundry,

331
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,820
 you read the tags on your shirt

332
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,740
 about how to wash it and how to not and so forth.

333
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,180
 And then there's guys.

334
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,020
 And, um.

335
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
 (congregation laughing)

336
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,260
 No, I'm sure there's guys out there who read the tags.

337
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,940
 But here's what's gonna happen for you gentlemen.

338
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,180
 This is a public service announcement.

339
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,060
 Let me help you out here.

340
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,220
 A little marriage advice.

341
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,580
 Someday, if you get married,

342
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,520
 you're gonna be in the laundry room,

343
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,780
 just trying to be hubby of the year,

344
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,660
 putting the laundry in.

345
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,940
 You're doing laundry for your wife.

346
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,020
 You're like, don't worry about me.

347
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,860
 It's okay.

348
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,580
 If I get nominated for husband of the year, no big deal.

349
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,180
 And doing the laundry, taking care of it.

350
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,580
 This happened to me recently.

351
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,700
 And I'm washing some of the clothes for my wife.

352
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,020
 And she had this, I don't even know what to call it.

353
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,000
 A poncho, I'm being told.

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,520
 It was like an afghan blanket with a hole in it.

355
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,060
 And you put it over.

356
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,520
 And it was from, I don't know.

357
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,940
 I'm just gonna embarrass myself

358
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,940
 if I try to name whatever store it was from.

359
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,740
 And anyways, so I'm washing them, throwing it in there.

360
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,560
 It's great.

361
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,800
 All of a sudden, you get the laundry done,

362
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,640
 everything's dry.

363
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,460
 It comes out.

364
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,700
 It looks like it was made for a seven-year-old.

365
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,780
 And it's this tiny thing

366
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,980
 that she had just gotten for Christmas,

367
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
 a very expensive item from a family member.

368
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,940
 She's like, you ruined this cashmere.

369
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,420
 Oh, okay, wow.

370
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,260
 Oh, wow.

371
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,180
 Judgmental people in here.

372
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,020
 This thing is so tiny.

373
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,180
 And I'm like, no, it'll be good.

374
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,420
 I get it soaking wet again.

375
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,660
 And I'm in the backyard,

376
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,540
 just trying to stretch this thing out.

377
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,800
 And it was unsuccessful.

378
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,680
 And I had failed to read.

379
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,600
 She was like, you didn't read?

380
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,840
 It says on the instructions, do not dry, do not dry.

381
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,520
 And I was like, who reads the instructions on these?

382
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,880
 Why would you put it in the dirty clothes hamper

383
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,360
 if you didn't want to?

384
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,960
 But in failing to read the instructions

385
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,840
 of the creator's design, it consequences.

386
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,320
 Now, that on a micro level is comical,

387
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,480
 but it's the same thing that happens

388
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,960
 anytime that we abandon God's design for anything.

389
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,880
 That there's pain that's introduced,

390
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,380
 there's consequences, there's damage

391
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,060
 that sometimes can be worked through,

392
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,780
 but oftentimes can't be undone.

393
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,660
 And that's what the Bible teaches,

394
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,640
 that God created the world,

395
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
 he designed it to work in a certain way.

396
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,920
 And so this is why God is opposed to homosexual behavior.

397
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,700
 So I wanna talk a little bit about

398
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,360
 why that may be even further.

399
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,560
 So if God is not opposed to homosexual attraction

400
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,240
 taking place in a person,

401
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,840
 but homosexual behavior being acted out,

402
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
 why would God be opposed to that?

403
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,760
 And I think there's a couple reasons

404
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,640
 that come to mind quickly.

405
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,660
 So our second idea of why would God be opposed

406
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,840
 to homosexual behavior?

407
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,760
 I mean, if it's two consenting adults,

408
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,280
 love is love, what's the big deal with one another?

409
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,400
 The first reason is because as it relates to marriage,

410
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,440
 the idea that a man and man, if it's love together,

411
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,000
 that could be defined as a marriage,

412
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,560
 is an offense to what God says

413
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,680
 all throughout the Bible, marriage is.

414
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,360
 Which is not just a man and a woman together,

415
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,320
 though it is that.

416
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,760
 It's ultimately a metaphor for Christ

417
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,080
 and his unending, unstoppable love

418
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,680
 for his bride, the church.

419
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,520
 Ultimately, in other words, marriage is a picture,

420
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,160
 not just of a man and woman on earth together,

421
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,840
 though that man and woman married together on earth

422
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,880
 is to be a reflection or to reflect

423
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
 what ultimately marriage is all about,

424
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
 which is Christ and his love for his bride, the church.

425
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,640
 And so to attack that is to attack

426
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
 what marriage really is all about,

427
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,680
 which is Jesus and his bride.

428
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,200
 Paul says this in Ephesians chapter five,

429
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
 verses 31 to 32.

430
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,900
 I read it this past weekend at a wedding that I was doing.

431
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,600
 I read it in every single wedding that I do,

432
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,800
 and it always jumps out to me.

433
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,360
 Here's what Paul says.

434
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,400
 For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

435
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
 and be united to his wife.

436
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,040
 This reason being marriage.

437
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,680
 And the two will become one flesh.

438
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,380
 Like, that's crazy.

439
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,480
 Two become one?

440
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,840
 Wow, man, that's shocking.

441
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840
 Paul says this, this is a profound mystery.

442
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,840
 Yeah, two becoming one, for sure.

443
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,600
 But I'm talking about Christ and the church.

444
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,560
 Paul says it's mysterious as man and woman,

445
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
 two becoming one together.

446
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,400
 Ultimately, the more profound and greater mystery

447
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,880
 is not how to two become one,

448
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,880
 but is ultimately about how this thing,

449
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,400
 this thing called marriage is ultimately about Christ

450
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,680
 and his bride, the church.

451
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,720
 And so man doesn't get to decide what it is

452
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
 and what it's not because it's ultimately not about man.

453
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,280
 It's about Jesus.

454
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,080
 Second reason why I think God is opposed to homosexuality

455
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,400
 and homosexual behavior is because of the

456
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,520
 unbelievable consequences that come

457
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,840
 as a result of that lifestyle.

458
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,200
 Consequences in the realm of mental health,

459
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,540
 of life expectancy, of disease, and of divorce.

460
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,340
 Here's what we know.

461
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,680
 I mean, there's been studies that have shown this,

462
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,760
 and I'm gonna list out some of the statistics

463
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,400
 and the sources that come from them.

464
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,200
 Homosexual, people who live in a homosexual lifestyle

465
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,160
 are 50% more likely to suffer from depression and abuse.

466
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,320
 They're 200% more likely to commit suicide.

467
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,560
 That comes from a recent study

468
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,440
 in the Medical Journal of BMC Psychiatry.

469
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,440
 Often suicide is blamed on religious people,

470
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,460
 or the church and societal pressure

471
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,560
 that makes them feel ostracized.

472
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,640
 And so if only society would just be more tolerant

473
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,760
 and accepting than those types of behaviors,

474
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,680
 that depression, suicide, substance abuse

475
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,960
 would all go away.

476
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
 And it's just not true.

477
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,680
 There's a study done in Sweden,

478
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,780
 a country that legalized in 1944 same-sex relationships.

479
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,480
 A country that was named

480
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,680
 by the International Lesbian Gay Association

481
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,480
 the most friendly country in Europe, if not the world.

482
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,560
 A country that in 2003 legalized

483
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,120
 that to talk negatively about someone's sexual orientation

484
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,660
 was a hate speech, punishable by crime or by jail,

485
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,480
 I mean by fine or by jail.

486
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,100
 To even suggest, like I'm doing right now,

487
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,220
 that God's design was for man and for woman,

488
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,160
 I could be put in jail.

489
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,360
 It's a country that has done as far as it can

490
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,880
 push the agenda to make sure

491
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,920
 that we create a tolerant environment.

492
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,320
 And they don't have less or lower suicide rates,

493
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,520
 they have higher.

494
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,720
 The suicide rates that were found of this study

495
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,900
 by the European Journal of Epidemiology in 2016, May 11th,

496
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,800
 was that suicide rates in Sweden

497
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,640
 are 300% among the homosexual community.

498
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,520
 The life expectancy,

499
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,240
 there's consequences not just in that arena,

500
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
 there's consequences in life expectancy.

501
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,660
 And I'm not here to like beat down with stats,

502
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,840
 there's a God who loves you,

503
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
 who doesn't want this for anyone

504
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,200
 any more than you would want it for someone

505
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,920
 if it's gonna dramatically impact their life

506
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,380
 and the life expectancy.

507
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,480
 The average life expectancy is diminished

508
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,020
 by between 20 and 24 years.

509
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,600
 The Eastern Psychological Association

510
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,100
 found that regardless of how tolerant the society is,

511
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,300
 the average is the same.

512
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,060
 They did further studies in European nations

513
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,440
 that have gone to great lengths for many years

514
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,040
 to normalize homosexual activity,

515
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,940
 and they found that still,

516
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,920
 the numbers were consistent with the United States,

517
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
 on average between 20 and 24.

518
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,320
 The study cites Denmark,

519
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,500
 where heterosexual males live to an age of 74,

520
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,640
 compared to homosexual males that live to an age of 51.

521
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,700
 The study Norway,

522
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,940
 where homosexual males live to an age of 77,

523
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,980
 heterosexual males live to 77,

524
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,240
 homosexual males to 52.

525
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,980
 And lesbian couples,

526
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,460
 78 among heterosexual women,

527
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,280
 compared to 56 among homosexual.

528
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,180
 A study found that only 1% of homosexual men

529
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,820
 will die of old age.

530
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,580
 1%.

531
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,020
 The study concluded that the homosexual lifestyle

532
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,980
 is significantly more dangerous than even smoking.

533
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,380
 And the God who's there, he's not angry,

534
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,740
 he's not a God who hates people in the homosexual lifestyle,

535
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,580
 he's a God who loves you,

536
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,180
 who doesn't want that for you.

537
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,420
 Not only impacts mental health and life expectancy,

538
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,380
 one of the reasons life expectancy is impacted

539
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,300
 is because of the prevalence of disease.

540
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,820
 The United States Center for Disease Control in 2013 found

541
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,980
 that while only 3% of the United States population

542
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,880
 was homosexual,

543
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,380
 the group is responsible for 50% of the cases of gonorrhea.

544
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,980
 60%, I'm sorry, of syphilis.

545
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,700
 60% of the cases of gonorrhea,

546
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,140
 and over 75% of the HIV cases in the last five years.

547
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,260
 The AIDS epidemic was so closely associated

548
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,100
 with the homosexual lifestyle

549
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,180
 that when it was originally coined in 1982,

550
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,460
 it was called GRID,

551
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,180
 Gay-Related Immune Deficiency.

552
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,980
 But there was just a prevalence of this disease

553
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
 among this community,

554
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,940
 and the God who's there, he's not angry,

555
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,680
 he's not looking to rip you off,

556
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,940
 he loves heterosexual and homosexual alike,

557
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,440
 and he doesn't want us to live in a way

558
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,580
 that's contrary to his design in any way,

559
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,900
 whether it's sleeping with your boyfriend right now,

560
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,120
 whether it's abusing alcohol right now,

561
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,040
 or whether it's living in a homosexual lifestyle right now.

562
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,820
 Why is disease so rampant?

563
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,840
 There's two reasons, and I don't wanna be too graphic.

564
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,260
 The first is because the human body

565
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,160
 is not made for anal sex,

566
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,500
 and the tissues and the things that are involved

567
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,020
 are more likely to create complications

568
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,420
 when sexual activity takes place.

569
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,700
 The second is because monogamy

570
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
 is the extreme, extreme minority.

571
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,280
 In other words, the likelihood of a gay married couple

572
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,140
 being committed exclusively to one another

573
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,280
 is not impossible, and it's not that it's never happened,

574
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,900
 but studies have shown it is a promiscuous environment,

575
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,700
 often tolerated, and even openly,

576
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,100
 it's fine to go after.

577
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,780
 Here's what a Swedish gay couple

578
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,740
 named Andrew and David Madison did a study

579
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,880
 in the Journal of Sex Research.

580
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,620
 They surveyed 2,583 couples who were married together.

581
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,520
 They found that not a single couple

582
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,820
 was able to sustain a monogamous sexual relationship.

583
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:17,100
 The average number of partners among those 2,583

584
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,460
 was between 100 and 500 partners,

585
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,100
 sexual partners in their life.

586
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,100
 Furthermore, the likelihood of divorce

587
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,900
 inside of a same-sex marriage is 50%

588
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,900
 if it's among gay men, and 167% more among lesbians.

589
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,720
 Why would God be opposed to this lifestyle?

590
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,500
 Jesus summarized the great commandments

591
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,400
 for all of us, and he summarized really the whole Bible.

592
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,900
 He was asked, "Hey, what's the greatest commandment?"

593
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,580
 And Jesus said, "You can sum up all of the law

594
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,940
 "and the prophets in Matthew 22,"

595
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,180
 and he said by two things, "Love God

596
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,040
 "and love your neighbor as yourself."

597
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,500
 The reason God would be opposed to this

598
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,760
 is because he knows it's hurting people of life.

599
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,380
 Said another way, the reason why, as the church,

600
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,260
 we feel the burden to talk and to shepherd

601
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,820
 through this issue and to talk about it

602
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,900
 and to share what God's word says

603
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,420
 is because we believe it would be unloving to not do so.

604
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,620
 And people in the room are gonna say,

605
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,160
 "No, it's so bigoted, I can't believe

606
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,580
 "you just love, as love, as love."

607
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,900
 If someone in your community or someone in your life,

608
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,340
 someone friend, maybe it's a family member,

609
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,440
 said, "Hey, I'm gonna make a decision.

610
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,440
 "I'm gonna move to a city, and in this city,

611
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,520
 "I'm gonna be more likely to be suicidal,

612
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,080
 "I'm gonna be more likely to be anxious,

613
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,000
 "I'm gonna be, almost certainly,

614
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,580
 "have a sexually transmitted disease,"

615
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,060
 and on and on from there, where I'm gonna have

616
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,540
 to have lots of time spent in hospitals.

617
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,180
 And not only that, I am guaranteed,

618
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,100
 it's a statistical fact, almost,

619
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,400
 as close as you could get, if the average is 51 years old,

620
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,120
 to die 24 years earlier.

621
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,040
 And God clearly says that's not an okay city to live in.

622
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,800
 Would it be loving for you to say,

623
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,780
 "Yeah, dude, go live there, man, you do you, come on."

624
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,760
 Of course it wouldn't be.

625
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,340
 And they may respond with, "Oh, come on,

626
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,840
 "we can't just love as love.

627
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,560
 "If you loved me, if you cared about me,

628
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,720
 "you would encourage the fact

629
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,020
 "that I'm gonna go live in this city."

630
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,020
 As followers of Jesus, any more than we could

631
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,440
 encourage divorce, which we will not,

632
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,220
 and that's an entirely other issue we can touch,

633
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,680
 or any more than we would encourage someone

634
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,200
 to participate in a polygamous marriage,

635
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,680
 or participate in raising children in a way that is abusive,

636
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,720
 we cannot encourage someone to make decisions,

637
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,020
 or to move to a city, or to choose a lifestyle,

638
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,000
 that not only God's word says,

639
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
 he commands and calls us not to,

640
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,680
 but even society, I mean, go look all those stats up,

641
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,320
 you can re-listen to it again.

642
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,160
 These are not like, "Oh yeah,

643
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,620
 "I made these up earlier today."

644
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,140
 They're clearly known things,

645
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,340
 and the consequences are huge.

646
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,340
 And if you're sitting there in the room,

647
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,280
 and you're thinking, "Gosh, this place is so bigoted,

648
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,280
 "I can't believe it," I think we love them more than you do.

649
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,220
 Because if someone is gonna choose a path

650
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,580
 that's gonna have unbelievably painful consequences,

651
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,300
 including leading to death, and you're like,

652
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,400
 "I don't care, you do you, man,

653
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,820
 "it makes me feel good inside to give you that approval."

654
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,000
 I, and this body of Christ, we love them more than you do.

655
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 Sadly, this is an issue that,

656
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,460
 for Christians increasingly more,

657
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,580
 you're gonna be called bigoted, hateful, homophobic,

658
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,120
 if you hold to these things.

659
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,220
 There was recently, someone had come and spray painted

660
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,340
 outside of Watermarks building,

661
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,180
 where this is not the first time,

662
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,260
 it's not the last time, it's actually happened since then,

663
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,540
 hey, Dallas tribe, whatever that means,

664
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,960
 racist, sexist, transphobic, biphobic,

665
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,920
 and this has happened multiple times since.

666
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,000
 On this particular occasion, it was a Sunday evening,

667
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,960
 and someone had gone out there and spray painted,

668
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,880
 and the reason they say that, I get it,

669
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,080
 is because of talking about it like this,

670
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,440
 and attempting to in a loving way.

671
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,740
 You know what the gospel irony about that was?

672
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,440
 That night, you know, we went out there and cleaned that up,

673
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,960
 one of the members who's plugged in here

674
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,740
 had his life changed, a black, same-sex attracted struggle,

675
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,200
 male, and a Middle Eastern man, both plugged in here,

676
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,740
 went out, got down, and they began to clean it off,

677
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,500
 saying, this is my church home,

678
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,540
 and people can call us bigoted,

679
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,680
 they can call me a racist, homophobic, transphobic,

680
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,220
 as a black person who struggles with same-sex community,

681
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,660
 or same-sex attractions, but my life has been changed,

682
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,020
 and I'll go out here and clean this up,

683
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,220
 and get on my hands and feet.

684
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,380
 He's not the bigot in that situation,

685
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,020
 whoever spray painted that is.

686
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,340
 The definition of bigot, you know what it is?

687
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,620
 Someone who doesn't tolerate other person's views.

688
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,860
 If you get called a bigot for holding to the Bible,

689
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,060
 you're not the bigot, they are.

690
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,380
 I mean, that's a fact.

691
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,220
 (congregation applauding)

692
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,780
 And that's, I mean, and we can clap all day long for it,

693
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,140
 but think about it.

694
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
 If someone is saying, hey, look,

695
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,980
 I know you hold to this book of 2,000 years old,

696
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,700
 it's been something around a long time,

697
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,180
 but I just think you're wrong, man,

698
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,460
 you're a bigot, you're an idiot, that's where you are.

699
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,860
 (congregation laughing)

700
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,560
 'Cause my opinion tells me I'm right and you're wrong.

701
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,900
 And if that's where you're holding inside of the room,

702
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,460
 I know that, I know,

703
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,860
 we're gonna get some emails on this one.

704
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,700
 But,

705
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:32,300
 we are striving to love every type of person,

706
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,260
 every sexual orientation that can be there.

707
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,500
 And God's word is clear on this one,

708
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,780
 just like he's clear, candidly,

709
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,080
 I'm gonna come back to it,

710
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,540
 on the heterosexual sin taking place in this room.

711
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,180
 That is much more prevalent than any homosexual sin.

712
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,100
 What if they find a gay gene?

713
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,340
 What if it comes out and they find like,

714
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,660
 man, there was a gay gene?

715
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,300
 To this point, studies have shown

716
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,200
 there has been nothing conclusively,

717
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,060
 but here's the deal, even if they did,

718
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,420
 that would fit well within what the Bible says

719
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,580
 is total depravity,

720
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,780
 or man having a sin nature that was born.

721
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,740
 I was born with a propensity

722
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,700
 where I wanted to have sex

723
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,500
 with every beautiful woman that I see,

724
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,140
 but I don't know that anyone thinks that's a good thing.

725
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,860
 There's been studies that have found,

726
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,740
 Time Magazine, in 2010,

727
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,820
 did an article that was called,

728
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,860
 Adultery, It's in Our Genes,

729
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
 that men have a propensity towards polygamy,

730
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,580
 and they think there's a genetic passing

731
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,400
 that has taken place.

732
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,880
 But I don't hear anyone being like,

733
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,700
 you know what, just let boys be boys,

734
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,100
 they can go sleep with whoever they want.

735
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,940
 I think people would say,

736
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,220
 well, that's probably not good for society,

737
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,740
 even if it's in our genes.

738
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,480
 Why would God make me this way?

739
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,700
 God did not make you,

740
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,020
 or he did not make someone in their sinful nature.

741
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,020
 We were all born with a broken sin nature.

742
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,820
 He did not make any of us sinful.

743
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,120
 He didn't make me polygamous.

744
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,500
 He didn't make you anyway.

745
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,200
 We were all born broken.

746
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,460
 And in that brokenness,

747
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,500
 it manifests itself in all kinds of ways

748
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,660
 that go from there.

749
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,300
 God is not the originator of your sin or mine.

750
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,340
 He's the solution for it.

751
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,700
 And he provided that solution

752
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,400
 by sending his son to be a savior.

753
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,020
 So how should we as the church change,

754
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,460
 or how must we, as the body of Christ,

755
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,540
 change our response?

756
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,580
 I wanna give just a few things,

757
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,900
 and then we're gonna close down here in a few minutes.

758
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,220
 The first is that I think we have to change

759
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,940
 the approach that we have with nonbelievers.

760
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,100
 The church has got to stop beating people

761
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,620
 with a Bible that they don't believe in.

762
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,140
 If someone's not a follower of Jesus,

763
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,940
 you don't point them to change their sexuality,

764
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,460
 you point them to their savior, to Jesus.

765
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,180
 Let me say it this way.

766
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,340
 God's biggest concern for someone

767
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,460
 who is in a homosexual relationship

768
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,500
 is not their sexuality.

769
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,380
 It's them knowing their savior, Jesus.

770
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,140
 None of us have to change our sexuality

771
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,500
 before you can become a Christian.

772
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,380
 Hey, stop doing that,

773
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,660
 and then you can become a part of our group.

774
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,140
 We invite people to come to know Jesus,

775
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,900
 and we trust that he will work at their hearts,

776
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,420
 and he'll begin to work inside of their lives.

777
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,000
 Just like you didn't change your behavior before you came,

778
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,460
 you didn't stop the pornography addiction

779
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,900
 before you trusted in Christ.

780
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,660
 And so the church has gotta be a place

781
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,980
 that stops pointing out people's sin

782
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,640
 who don't claim the name of Jesus.

783
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,200
 We point them to their savior.

784
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,260
 At the end of the day, God's desire for people

785
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,460
 is not calling them to be heterosexual,

786
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,920
 it's calling them to be holy.

787
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,560
 The second way I think we've gotta change

788
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,880
 is that we cannot be people who fold on truth

789
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,200
 and the truth from God's word,

790
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,080
 and we cannot beat people down with it.

791
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
 We cannot be people who just say,

792
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,560
 you know what, society's changed, it's fine, no big deal,

793
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,360
 who cares, I don't really read this thing anyways.

794
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,760
 We have to be people who hold to the truth

795
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,600
 that found in God's word.

796
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,240
 Sadly, there are entire denominations

797
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,920
 who are saying, ah, you know, it's fine.

798
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,240
 Maybe we just missed it on this one,

799
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
 maybe society has changed.

800
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,120
 The homosexual activity in the first century

801
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,080
 far outweighs anything that takes place today.

802
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
 Go to any sort of historical research and you'll see that.

803
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,880
 So to argue that like society's changed,

804
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,360
 are you kidding me?

805
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,640
 Pediastry was embraced and accepted.

806
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,720
 In other words, pedophilia was embraced and accepted.

807
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,200
 There was all types of sexual engagements

808
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,880
 that all of us would say is not okay.

809
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,400
 Prostitutes were a normal part of society.

810
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,280
 The sexual norms of that day

811
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,200
 were not way behind our heads.

812
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,120
 They were not way behind ours,

813
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,640
 like, oh, grandma's back there.

814
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,160
 They were way past anything that we see today.

815
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
 So to think that the Bible, you know,

816
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,520
 it's got to catch up with the times, are you kidding me?

817
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,240
 They make Las Vegas look like tame.

818
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,440
 I mean, that's true.

819
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,560
 Do any sort of historical study on that.

820
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
 And so we can't be people who are just like,

821
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,160
 you know what, things have changed, throw the towel in.

822
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,000
 Thankfully, those denominations are crippling

823
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,920
 and shutting down.

824
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,080
 Because people aren't hungry for, you know what,

825
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,120
 this book really doesn't really matter that much

826
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,920
 and do whatever, you do you, man,

827
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,340
 just show up and pay the tithe.

828
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,340
 That's embarrassing and an affront to God

829
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,900
 and it's not the church.

830
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,240
 The second way the church can't do,

831
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,280
 or we cannot respond is not just unfolding on truth,

832
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,800
 but also on beating people down.

833
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,720
 Examples like this.

834
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,460
 This is offensive.

835
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,200
 This is disgusting.

836
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,560
 Not only because it uses an offensive term,

837
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,260
 which I'm not even gonna justify by using,

838
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,000
 but because it's not true.

839
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,240
 In order for that sign even to be true,

840
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,560
 you have to put love in there.

841
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,320
 Because God loves people in a gay lifestyle,

842
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,240
 people in a straight lifestyle, people of every lifestyle.

843
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,540
 He loved them so much he would give his life for them

844
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,160
 if they were just them on the planet.

845
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,360
 And that's an offense and that's disgusting.

846
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,200
 And I know inside of this room,

847
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,080
 the church probably goes, yeah, amen, for sure.

848
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
 But anytime that we ostracize, alienate,

849
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
 or treat this sin as though it's something different

850
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,120
 than all the other ones,

851
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,200
 we are in a minor degree participating in the same way.

852
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,360
 There's no difference.

853
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,180
 All of us are broken in need of a savior.

854
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,940
 The third thing is around how we approach fellow believers

855
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,060
 who have same-sex attraction.

856
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,400
 I'll move quickly through this.

857
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,240
 How do we do that?

858
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,880
 How do we approach our fellow believers

859
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,300
 who struggle with same-sex attraction?

860
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,000
 We do what we do with people with,

861
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,260
 or non-same-sex attraction.

862
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,380
 We point them to truth.

863
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,860
 We hope that they point us to truth.

864
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,540
 We walk alongside them in community with one another

865
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,900
 and we bear one another's burdens.

866
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,740
 The church has got to create safe environments

867
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,420
 for people to be able to talk about this.

868
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,460
 Where people can come and know that,

869
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,420
 hey, I can bring forward same-sex attraction.

870
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,500
 I'm not gonna be judged anymore

871
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,140
 than if I bring forward heterosexual attraction.

872
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,920
 And we come alongside one another and we care

873
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,880
 and we lock arms and we fight against sin together.

874
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,140
 This is what the body of Christ does.

875
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,180
 We live in community.

876
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,060
 And the third thing I think,

877
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,460
 where at least I can speak for myself,

878
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,100
 is I think we could do a better job of acknowledging

879
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,060
 the extent to which the gospel

880
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,860
 and picking up your cross daily

881
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:02,940
 is calling people who have same-sex attraction to.

882
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:08,380
 In other words, I think even just some sort of recognition

883
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,740
 that look, dude, at the end of the day,

884
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,980
 all of us to follow Jesus,

885
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,460
 Jesus says, "Pick up your cross and follow me."

886
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,220
 But not all crosses are the same weight.

887
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,420
 And the reality that, man, in doing that,

888
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,300
 if you're a part of the,

889
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,660
 if you have same-sex attraction

890
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,500
 in a way that you're like, look,

891
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,420
 I've prayed for God to take it away,

892
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,460
 he's not taking it away.

893
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,700
 And I've come to the reality

894
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,540
 that I am choosing to follow Jesus,

895
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,820
 I'm choosing that I may have a life

896
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,020
 of celibacy ahead of me.

897
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,900
 We need to, as a body of Christ,

898
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,060
 look at that and say what is true.

899
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,660
 That's amazing.

900
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,840
 Your faith inspires me.

901
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,700
 The fact that you say, hey, though none go with me,

902
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,660
 I'm gonna follow you.

903
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,400
 If it costs me my sexuality,

904
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,540
 I surrender it all to you, Jesus.

905
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,100
 You were an inspiration to me.

906
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,260
 You strengthened my faith.

907
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,900
 There are people of you in the room right now

908
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,780
 listening in Fort Worth, listening in Houston,

909
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,180
 you strengthen my faith.

910
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,760
 You make me wanna be more like Jesus.

911
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,340
 I think some of the strongest faiths at Watermark

912
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,060
 are men and women who choose to be celibate

913
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,900
 for the kingdom of God.

914
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,380
 That's what you're doing.

915
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,080
 Choosing to say, God, even my sexuality, it's yours.

916
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
 You're the Lord of my life.

917
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,820
 Maybe the most Christ-like people in the church today

918
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,340
 are the people who say, God,

919
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,620
 even I would choose to be celibate for the kingdom of God

920
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,120
 just like my Savior was.

921
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,620
 And you are an inspiration to me.

922
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,900
 And not all crosses are the same weight,

923
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,900
 but the way that you allow the one who's in you

924
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,540
 who's greater than the temptation you feel,

925
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,800
 greater than the world around you

926
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,480
 to be strong in the midst of weakness is an inspiration.

927
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,140
 May God multiply your kind.

928
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,420
 What I know is that in eternity,

929
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,780
 as hard as it may feel, even in this moment,

930
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,980
 the reality, I mean, think about it.

931
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,060
 For those of you who are not same-sex attracted,

932
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,300
 think about just the crushing weight.

933
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,080
 Many of us feel as singles in the room,

934
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,500
 wondering like, am I gonna be single for forever?

935
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,260
 I mean, think about it.

936
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,600
 Think about waking up with the reality.

937
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,940
 (congregation laughing)

938
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,440
 It's a crushing weight.

939
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,300
 I mean, think about that.

940
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,380
 If you were going, hey, unless God changes something here,

941
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,180
 I'm never gonna have that type of relationship

942
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,340
 where I wake up next to someone,

943
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,520
 where we raise children together.

944
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,540
 God can change something.

945
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,340
 We're gonna come back to that in a second.

946
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,540
 But that's amazing.

947
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,200
 You inspire me.

948
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,200
 You make me wanna know Jesus more, follow him more.

949
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,960
 And I'm confident that in eternity,

950
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,440
 everything that may be in stewarding this,

951
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,040
 that you experience,

952
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,920
 that you may miss out on, maybe marriage, kids,

953
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,120
 all of that stuff will pale in comparison

954
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,240
 to what God has in waiting for you.

955
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,360
 'Cause here's what the scripture says.

956
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,200
 It almost speaks of, in multiple places,

957
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,340
 that it's almost as though when we get to eternity,

958
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,660
 there's gonna be people who were not celibate,

959
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,040
 who were not same-sex attracted,

960
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,000
 who look at you and they're like, dude, oh my gosh,

961
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,720
 unbelievable, the way that God rewarded you.

962
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,280
 I wish that on earth I would've walked through that.

963
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,560
 It says this in Isaiah chapter 56, verses four through five.

964
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,680
 "This is what the Lord says to those who are eunuchs,

965
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,060
 "those who are same-sex attracted,

966
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,100
 "those who keep celibate for my sake,

967
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,020
 "for the kingdom of God,

968
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,240
 "who choose to do what pleases me

969
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,480
 "and hold fast to my covenant.

970
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,600
 "To them, I will give within my temple and my walls

971
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,700
 "a memorial in a name that is better

972
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,960
 "than sons and daughters.

973
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,600
 "I will give them an everlasting name

974
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,440
 "that will endure forever.

975
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,720
 "Those who choose to be celibate for the sake of God,"

976
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,800
 he says, "for all of eternity,

977
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,480
 "I will give you a reward that makes anything in this life

978
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,600
 "that you missed out on pale."

979
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
 So what's ahead?

980
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,240
 I know that doesn't ease the burden or lighten it,

981
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,280
 but at the same time,

982
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,160
 know that God has not forgotten you.

983
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,440
 He sees you, loves you,

984
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,820
 and you are an inspiration to us.

985
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,040
 The final thing that I think we need to do

986
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,520
 is that we have to put change

987
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,180
 firmly in the hands of the Holy Spirit,

988
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,660
 that people are not projects.

989
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,240
 There is no, someone today asked,

990
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,880
 does Watermark do the gay conversion therapy?

991
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
 No.

992
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,960
 The Holy Spirit does change.

993
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,940
 Watermark doesn't do any change, honestly.

994
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,560
 The Spirit of God either moves in

995
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,580
 and begins to change in people's life, or he doesn't.

996
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,620
 And so as the body of Christ,

997
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,620
 we put change firmly in the hands of the Holy Spirit.

998
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,620
 We come alongside to encourage and walk alongside.

999
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,980
 And it would be a disservice if I told you right now

1000
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,500
 that if you just read your Bible enough,

1001
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
 God will change your sexual orientation.

1002
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,540
 And it would also be a disservice to God

1003
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,940
 if I told you that he could not

1004
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,500
 change your sexual orientation.

1005
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,560
 I have friends in my life,

1006
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,320
 and they may be the rare exception,

1007
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,100
 but it would be, if God can bring dead people alive,

1008
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,420
 he can bring change about.

1009
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,700
 And yet he may just call you to steward that,

1010
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,740
 to show the world that Jesus is enough.

1011
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,300
 And to be an example to a community

1012
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,380
 that only needs more and more examples.

1013
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,140
 But Paul even says it is possible

1014
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,740
 if change does at times take place.

1015
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,860
 In 1 Corinthians chapter six, we read earlier

1016
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,620
 where he said, "Hey, do not be deceived.

1017
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,340
 "Wrongdoers won't inherit the kingdom of God,

1018
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,320
 "neither will sexually immoral, idolaters,

1019
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,180
 "adulterers," people who have sex with men

1020
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,020
 or men who have sex with men,

1021
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,820
 "greedy, drunkards, slanderers, swindlers.

1022
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,300
 "None of these will inherit the kingdom of God."

1023
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,100
 And that is what some of you were.

1024
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,740
 But you were washed, were.

1025
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,340
 You were sanctified, you were justified

1026
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,500
 in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God.

1027
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,100
 That there are times that God, for whatever reason,

1028
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,780
 chooses to move in and bring change,

1029
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,240
 and other times, despite asking over and over, he doesn't.

1030
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,140
 But I wanna show a video now, just to be an encouragement.

1031
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,920
 If you're finding yourself walking through

1032
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
 some of the valley of the shadow of just wrestling with that

1033
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,060
 and where you can find encouragement

1034
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
 and hopefully hope in the midst of that.

1035
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:56,780
 (congregation applauding)

1036
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,180
 I hesitated to show that video

1037
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,980
 because I know that it could paint the picture

1038
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,860
 that that's what will happen, and that's what God does,

1039
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,340
 and I know that's not true.

1040
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,180
 I know it is possible, and I know he does, and he has,

1041
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,880
 and I've seen it in close friends' lives,

1042
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,280
 but I know he often doesn't.

1043
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,700
 And he allows you to shout to the world, "Jesus is enough."

1044
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,740
 And what's amazing is

1045
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,540
 there's such an amazing, beautiful purity

1046
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,380
 in following Jesus when you surrender that.

1047
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,020
 I mean, really, when you surrender anything

1048
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,140
 and you surrender your life, it's a lot easier to hide.

1049
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,620
 When heterosexuality is just a part of your struggle,

1050
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,940
 or pornography is eating you alive,

1051
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,380
 or you're sleeping with your boyfriend,

1052
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,380
 but when you have to say, "Man, I'm gonna surrender publicly,"

1053
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,980
 you can't hide, and that's amazing.

1054
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,220
 And there are many of you inside of this room

1055
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,100
 who strengthen this church and the church.

1056
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,220
 If I had a son, or I do have a son, if I...

1057
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,140
 (audience laughing)

1058
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,180
 If I had one, which I do,

1059
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,140
 I have a son named Cruz, he's two and a half years old.

1060
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,420
 He's the best thing ever, next to his mom and sister.

1061
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,180
 And there came a day where he came to me and he said,

1062
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,980
 "Dad, I'm attracted to guys."

1063
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,940
 He's 12, he's 16, I don't know when.

1064
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:37,340
 And thinking about this this week, I was going,

1065
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,300
 "Dad, I hope that I would respond

1066
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,660
 "in a loving way that would point him

1067
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,100
 "to the truth of God's word."

1068
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,620
 'Cause if I didn't, if I was like,

1069
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,720
 "Man, I'd throw this out the window

1070
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,180
 "'cause now it's different," I would not be loving him.

1071
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,980
 And at the same time, I mean,

1072
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,020
 to be something I would never wish on him.

1073
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,140
 I say that just like I don't think anyone in the room

1074
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,380
 would wish it, or even wants or wishes,

1075
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,940
 if that's a part of your story.

1076
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,480
 But if he chose to honor God in his singleness and said,

1077
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,180
 "I'm gonna choose to be celibate for the kingdom of heaven,"

1078
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,440
 I would be so proud of him.

1079
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,820
 I would be so much more proud

1080
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,140
 than if he was the quarterback of the football team

1081
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,780
 who was dating the cheerleader captain

1082
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,740
 and had everything going on, but he didn't know Jesus.

1083
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,600
 I would be heartbroken for him at that stage.

1084
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,540
 But if he was someone who said, "God, despite the fact that,

1085
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,700
 "was I born this way, was I not?

1086
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,840
 "I don't really know, for whatever reason,

1087
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,620
 "this is what is a part of my wiring,

1088
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,820
 "and I'm choosing to honor you, God, with even that,"

1089
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,020
 I would be so proud of him.

1090
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,060
 And if you're inside of the room

1091
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,900
 and you're choosing right now,

1092
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,220
 "Hey, God, above my desires, above my sexuality,

1093
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,220
 "above anything else, I surrender it to you.

1094
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,420
 "And I'm gonna choose to honor you.

1095
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,860
 "You're the God, you're the king of my heart,

1096
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,300
 "the king of my life, and I'll honor you with even that."

1097
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,920
 I am so proud of you, and you have a heavenly father,

1098
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,400
 just like I was with my son or would be with my son,

1099
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,720
 who is so proud of you.

1100
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,560
 Keep going.

1101
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,800
 Don't lose heart.

1102
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,120
 The scriptures say that this life is like a vapor

1103
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,520
 and it will end, and today, I know the burden

1104
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,400
 and the weight of that is heavy.

1105
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
 You are not alone.

1106
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,300
 And the body of Christ and the spirit of Christ are there

1107
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,800
 and want to be there in increasingly better ways.

1108
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,760
 And you strengthen us, you make us better.

1109
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,400
 May God multiply your kind and make us better ministers

1110
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,380
 to every sexual-oriented person out there

1111
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,260
 of every different kind.

1112
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,100
 Let me pray.

1113
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:53,660
 Father, I just wanna pray first for...

1114
00:45:53,660 --> 00:46:02,360
 For men and women inside of this room,

1115
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,520
 who for whatever reason,

1116
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,440
 you have allowed to experience an orientation

1117
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,440
 that may not align with God's word.

1118
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,280
 And I pray that you would strengthen their faith.

1119
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,600
 You would multiply their kind of people who just say,

1120
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,280
 "God, above my sexuality, regardless if I'm homosexual

1121
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,460
 "or heterosexual, you're the king,

1122
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,180
 "and I surrender it to you.

1123
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,840
 "Help me."

1124
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,400
 And so I wanna pray specifically for friends in the room

1125
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,880
 that struggle with same-sex attraction, God,

1126
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,680
 that you would fill them with hope

1127
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,760
 and that you would be so big inside of their life

1128
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,720
 that everything else would be moved to the side.

1129
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,720
 Father, I wanna pray for all of us

1130
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,360
 who can be tempted every single day

1131
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,960
 to make something or someone else sit on the throne

1132
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,160
 of our hearts and of our lives that you would win

1133
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,660
 and you would take ground.

1134
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,280
 We all walked into this room sexually broken

1135
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,380
 in one way or another.

1136
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:11,740
 And we all walked into this room sinfully broken

1137
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,400
 in many ways.

1138
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,420
 And we need your help, God.

1139
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,080
 Would you help us to bear one another burden,

1140
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,720
 to walk alongside of one another,

1141
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,600
 and to be an example to a watching world

1142
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,600
 that Jesus is enough, and he's king, and he's good.

1143
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,000
 We worship you now in song.
