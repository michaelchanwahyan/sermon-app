1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Porch, how we doing? We doing okay?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,880
 Hey, welcome to Porch Christmas. So glad that you're here.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,520
 Thankful that we've gotten to journey together all year long and we are bringing it home

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,680
 tonight. I love the fact that

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,560
 we're getting to kind of ring in the holiday at the beginning of December so we can really

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,000
 calibrate ourselves and get ourselves prepared for where we're going over the course of the next month as we step into Christmas.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,440
 So without further ado, I thought I would just start with a story

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:36,280
 as per usual. Well for some of you, the pressure is high this Christmas because

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:44,400
 you're going to be spending the holiday with your significant other's family for the very first time.

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,940
 I remember when this happened for me. It was

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,760
 2017. Brooke and I were first married and I

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,360
 finally got the opportunity to bring in the holiday and celebrate with some Christmas spirit alongside my

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,640
 in-laws. And it was meaningful for me because of a couple of different reasons. Number one, because I had never been invited

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,320
 to celebrate the holiday with them. Not because they don't like me. We get along great.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,400
 They just have a rule in their family that you have to ring it to bring it.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,880
 Which meant that if you're so serious about your relationship, then you'll put your money where your mouth is.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,520
 And you'll put a rock on her finger. And then you get entry into the family festivities. Which by that point, I had done so.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,080
 It was also meaningful because the second reason was they take Christmas very, very seriously. Like some of your families,

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,160
 they care a lot about

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,040
 the holiday.

21
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:48,160
 So much so that they gear up with all sorts of different traditions. Things like baking cookies every single year and stringing lights together and

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,560
 watching Christmas vacation. Anybody a fan in here of that one? And wearing matching Christmas pajamas.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,000
 I had never been a part of that, but now I have several sets of Christmas pajamas from years past.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,800
 Taking Christmas Eve and sitting by the fire, waking up in the morning and opening presents one

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,720
 by one

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,560
 by one. So we could see what everybody got. They take their Christmas traditions very

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,200
 seriously. And I was all for it because I came from a family that was the exact same way.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,880
 But there was one tradition that stood out to me most of all. And it was this. On Christmas morning,

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,640
 before we did anything, before we opened any presents,

30
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,400
 before we we made our way to the stockings or we considered the rest of our day's plans,

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,360
 we read the Christmas story.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,080
 Not the one about Ralphie and the Red Ryder BB gun,

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,800
 but the one about Jesus. The fact that Christ in this season came and he came for you and

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
 me. You see, they knew what I knew and I'm praying you would know tonight.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,400
 That as wonderful as all the pageantry of Christmas is, the real wonder is found in the person of Christmas himself.

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,720
 It's found in Jesus.

37
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,640
 Now, why do I tell you all of this? Because some of you here are wondering why you haven't gotten an invitation to Christmas yet.

38
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
 And the fact may be you haven't put a ring on it.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,240
 So you should make haste because that may be your entry to spending time with the family.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,480
 But also and more importantly than that,

41
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:27,480
 bigger than the festivities of the holiday, more than lights and baked goods and dinner with family and time by the fire

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,840
 and singing Christmas carols or whatever it may be for you.

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,280
 There is something so significant in this season

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,160
 where the true wonder of the holiday lies in wait.

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,400
 And that's what I want to talk to you about tonight.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,360
 That's what I want to help us find here at the beginning of this

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,200
 Christmas season. And the way that I want to do it is I want to look at the book of Philippians.

48
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,360
 So if you have a Bible, you can turn there with me. The book of Philippians. Now you may be wondering

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
 why are we going to Philippians? This is not my normal place for a Christmas message.

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,360
 Typically you would find yourself at the the front chapters of one of the Gospels.

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,720
 Maybe one of the verses that you read at the beginning of the night in our opener.

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,320
 But the reason we're looking at Philippians 2 is I think that therein lies the kind of wonder

53
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,080
 I really want us to get tonight. Because what we see is a

54
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,320
 perspective on Christmas

55
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,680
 that's not earthly,

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,280
 but is heavenly.

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,680
 You see in Philippians 2 we get to stand and not from our vantage point here on planet Earth,

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,560
 but we get to stand from the vantage point of God himself in heaven as he thinks about this moment.

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,040
 The moment that we've come to celebrate this month.

60
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,080
 And what we know is that as we see through God's own eyes on this holiday,

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,480
 we'll find the reason that the season is so significant.

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,640
 Namely three reasons in specific. The first of which is this, that Jesus was born to reach a lost world.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
 Jesus was born to reach a lost world. That's what it says starting in verse 6. Verse 6 says,

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
 "Who, though he was in the form of God,

65
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,000
 did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,560
 But he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men."

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,160
 Now, I want you to stop where you are and just think about this for a minute.

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,280
 Like this statement is telling us something about the nature of who Jesus is.

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,840
 Actually, it's telling us the fundamental nature of who Jesus is.

70
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,600
 So the same way that if Jesus were to wear a letter jacket, all the patches on his arms, they would detail

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,720
 characteristics about who he is. That he's a friend of sinners, and he went all state in miracle making,

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,080
 and he was first team when it came to saving the world. Like he would have patches lined along his arms that detail

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,360
 these different

74
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,400
 characteristics of who he is. And yet most fundamental to who he is, that identifier which you would find on the back of his

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
 jacket would be "Son of God."

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,360
 Because that is the name that is most fundamental to who Christ is.

77
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,160
 Like when he says he's in the form of God,

78
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,600
 it's not saying that he looks like God. It's not saying that he's a substitute. He's a nice alternative.

79
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,280
 It's saying that he's actually God. You get that?

80
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,400
 And if we gathered here, and you heard that news, that would be good enough reason for us to get in this room together tonight.

81
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,840
 Because that is amazing. Like if you want to find the wonder of the holiday,

82
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,720
 what's more wonderful than that? Than this idea that a God in heaven became a man here on this earth.

83
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,840
 Like that is jaw-dropping. That's awe-inspiring.

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:42,440
 That's wonderful beyond measure. And yet Paul, as he writes through this, he doesn't just stop there.

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,280
 Like what we know is he goes on to tell us that

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,960
 he was in the form of God, and yet he emptied himself.

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,480
 Because he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped. That word "grasped" in

88
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,280
 the original language, it's the idea of seizing something or taking something by force.

89
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,560
 So just to get some perspective, what Jesus is saying here is, is I, as Jesus Christ, am the most powerful being in the

90
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
 world, in all creation, and yet I'm not on a power trip.

91
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
 Like I'm not looking out for myself.

92
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,000
 I'm actually willing to lay aside my sovereignty, punt on my privileges, give up my glory,

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,560
 because I'm not thinking about me. I'm thinking about you. I'll do whatever it takes to get close to you, to help you.

94
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,680
 Isaiah 53, 2 tells us,

95
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,600
 "He had no former majesty

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,560
 that we would look at him,

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,480
 no beauty that we should desire him."

98
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,640
 So this is a good, this is a good moment for me to introduce someone

99
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,560
 to the stage.

100
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,640
 Porch, will y'all do a great job of helping me welcome my son Cash Levi to the platform?

101
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:05,760
 Let's see if we can find him. There he is.

102
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:12,920
 Okay, he just spit up all over Brooke. That's good. I'm glad you emptied up before you got on stage, buddy.

103
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,320
 All right, let's go. Mom, stay close.

104
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
 Porch, meet little Cash.

105
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:27,600
 Doning his very own Porch t-shirt, if you can see this. Cash, meet several thousand of your best friends.

106
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,120
 When Cash was born,

107
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,200
 a couple of things struck me.

108
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,680
 Number one, I

109
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,480
 was struck by how remarkable he is.

110
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,080
 Remarkable in the sense that he's a true gift from God to us.

111
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
 But I was also struck by the fact

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,160
 that he's pretty regular.

113
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,160
 In the sense that he's just like me and he's just like you.

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,960
 Jesus was the same way.

115
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,880
 Jesus was remarkable, a gift from God.

116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,600
 And yet Jesus became regular, just like me and just like you.

117
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
 Jesus

118
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:22,360
 was totally self-sufficient before he came to this earth. But when he came as a baby, he became like Cash.

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,560
 And he needs his mommy and daddy for everything.

120
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,760
 Jesus, before he came,

121
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,160
 was totally self-reliant.

122
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,160
 And yet, like Cash,

123
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,840
 he relied upon others to meet his needs.

124
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,800
 There was no aura about Jesus when he was here on this earth.

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,480
 There was no halo over his head. If he had walked into this room tonight,

126
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
 he wouldn't have floated to his seat.

127
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,760
 He would have looked

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,560
 just like you,

129
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,440
 just like me.

130
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 And he would have been like him.

131
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,520
 Jesus came

132
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,160
 and he set aside his transcendence as

133
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,680
 God and he took upon dependence.

134
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
 Like a babe.

135
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,560
 That's how badly Jesus wanted to reach you.

136
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,840
 That's how badly Jesus wanted to reach me.

137
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,640
 He was willing to become like us.

138
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:31,760
 That's how far he would go. He didn't hedge his bets. He wasn't one foot in, one foot out.

139
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,400
 He emptied himself completely.

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 Because he loves you.

141
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,200
 It says that he's come not just to be a man, but to be a servant. Why a servant?

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,400
 Because he wants to help you.

143
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,800
 He wants to help those that are helpless.

144
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,200
 He wants to love those that are unlovely.

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,080
 He wants to redeem those that feel beyond redemption and save those that think they cannot be saved.

146
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,720
 That's how much Jesus in this season matters.

147
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,200
 You've been very good.

148
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,160
 Thank you. I'm so glad that you like those lights.

149
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 I'm gonna give you back to your mommy now.

150
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:32,480
 Jesus was not just born to reach a lost world.

151
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,080
 He was also born to rescue a broken people.

152
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,480
 He was born to rescue a broken people.

153
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
 That's what verse 8 tells us. Verse 8 says that in being found in human form,

154
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,800
 he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

155
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,600
 You see, that's the important part of Christmas. Like Jesus didn't just come to associate with you.

156
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,160
 He came to liberate you. Like 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 says, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though

157
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,360
 he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty

158
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,280
 you might become rich." Meaning Jesus didn't just come for you. You get that. Like he didn't just come to associate.

159
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,000
 He came to change everything for you. He came to liberate you. Y'all know that movie, The Nightmare Before Christmas?

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,880
 That movie that can't make up its mind if it's Halloween or Christmas flick? Nightmare Before Christmas.

161
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,640
 That's a pretty appropriate title for your story before Jesus ever entered in.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,840
 It was a nightmare. And yet Jesus came into your story not just to

163
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,640
 shine a light into the recesses of your soul and show you just how broken you are.

164
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,880
 Not just to prove to you that you really are messed up, but you know what? Hey, what good luck.

165
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,320
 You're gonna have to figure that out by yourself.

166
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,520
 No, he came because he wanted to figure that out for you.

167
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,600
 Like he stepped in to fix the most broken parts of who you are. To free you of your failures, to save you of your

168
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,760
 sins, to ultimately redeem you in your worst mistakes.

169
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,320
 That's why he came. The birth of Christ that we celebrate at Christmas is Jesus looking upon your helpless estate and saying,

170
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,440
 "I can help!"

171
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,200
 Like you don't think that you have anyone who could help you in the most

172
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,120
 heart-wrenching places of your life and yet I can do it. If you need a liberator, I

173
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,920
 can liberate you. If you need a redeemer, I can redeem you. If you need a healer, I can heal you.

174
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,040
 If you need a Savior, that's what I've come to do.

175
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,280
 I have come willing to empty myself so that you might be filled up instead.

176
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,840
 You see, Jesus

177
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,280
 he did the unthinkable.

178
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,440
 He descended

179
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,880
 from God to man, to servant, to death,

180
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,680
 to even death on a cross, an

181
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,240
 infinite humiliation for the Son of God.

182
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
 So that you might ascend

183
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,000
 from death

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,720
 to life,

185
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,920
 to child of God, to eternity with him forever.

186
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
 I love the way CJ Mahaney says,

187
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,240
 "Christ bore it alone

188
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,040
 that we might not ever be alone."

189
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,400
 So what do you do when you know all of this?

190
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
 Once you know that Jesus was born to reach a lost world and rescue a broken people,

191
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
 you do what God does, which is where this

192
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,640
 passage ends in verses 9 through 11.

193
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:33,680
 It says, "Therefore," because of all of this, because Jesus has been born to reach a lost world and to rescue a broken people,

194
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,440
 "Therefore God has highly exalted him.

195
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,120
 He's bestowed on him the name that's above every name, so that at the name of Jesus

196
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,320
 every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."

197
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,680
 You see, you remember who Jesus is. You see the life

198
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,440
 he lived, the lengths that he would go to get to you, and

199
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,360
 then you respond rightly.

200
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,160
 How do you respond?

201
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,960
 With rejoicing.

202
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,280
 You praise him because there's no one like him,

203
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,520
 because you know that Jesus was born to reign over

204
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
 everything.

205
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,840
 He was born to reign over everything, and that includes you.

206
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,840
 In theological circles, whenever you work through this section of Scripture,

207
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,920
 there are three terms used to describe

208
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,560
 the detail that Paul's unpacking.

209
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,760
 The first is Christ's condescension,

210
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:37,520
 that he condescended, that he lowered himself from heaven to earth. The next is Christ's

211
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 reconciliation, that he bore our shame in

212
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,280
 sin on the cross. And then the last is Christ's exaltation,

213
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,360
 that though he died,

214
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,520
 death could not keep him.

215
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,160
 But he rose forth from the grave because he is who he says he is. He did what he said he would do.

216
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,280
 He's not just a nice guy, a miracle worker, a helpful teacher.

217
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,640
 He's God, and he conquered that unconquerable foe. He vanquished our very worst enemy.

218
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,840
 He ultimately

219
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,600
 dominated that which was dominating you and condemning you to separation from him forever.

220
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,640
 He took away your sin, and as he rose forth from the grave, he declared

221
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,360
 that I am who I say I am. I am king.

222
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,400
 And he sits on his throne tonight.

223
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,000
 He reigns over all tonight.

224
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,760
 He rules over everything

225
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,520
 tonight. What does that mean, that he rules? We don't really use that kind of language.

226
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,960
 Like you don't say like, "I rule over my cubicle."

227
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,520
 No one talks about

228
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
 their workspace like that.

229
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,920
 You might look at someone and say, "You rule," but that's the closest thing we get.

230
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,080
 So what does it mean when the scripture is telling us that he reigns, that he rules? It means he's not only all-powerful,

231
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,440
 it means he has the right to rule, and he has the right to rule

232
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,120
 because he is

233
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
 king.

234
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,280
 And so some of you need to know tonight, like I don't know what the holidays hold.

235
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,040
 I don't know what the month ahead has in store,

236
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,400
 but because Jesus reigns on his throne right now,

237
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,400
 you have a reason for hope.

238
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
 Because Jesus reigns on his throne right now,

239
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
 you have a reason for peace.

240
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,440
 Because Jesus reigns on his throne right now,

241
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,640
 you have a reason for joy.

242
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,080
 I remember

243
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,000
 just several years ago

244
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,440
 finding myself so excited because Christmas was coming.

245
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,480
 Love this holiday, the chance to be with my family,

246
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,640
 to sit by the table with my friends, to enjoy good food, to watch cheesy Hallmark movies, to sing those songs

247
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,360
 and avoid Mariah Carey at all costs. You know, I was just pumped, man. I love this season

248
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,080
 for all of these reasons, and yet what I realized

249
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,120
 is that that name,

250
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,960
 which is at the center of the holiday, it didn't evoke within me

251
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,360
 the kind of wonder I wanted.

252
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,200
 Maybe that's you here tonight.

253
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,880
 What you need to know is that the name at the center of this holiday is that name which is above every name.

254
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,880
 It's the name which every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess. He is Lord.

255
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,800
 Both heaven on earth and under the earth. If you want to be reawakened to the wonder of

256
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,320
 Christmas,

257
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,720
 then you need look no further than the one

258
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
 that sought to reach a lost world,

259
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,800
 rescue a broken people, and today reigns over all things.

260
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,160
 If you want to be reawakened to the wonder of Christmas,

261
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,080
 you need look no further

262
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,520
 than the one who came looking for you.

263
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,760
 Let me pray for us.

264
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,920
 God, we love you

265
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,000
 and thankful

266
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,520
 here God standing at the final Tuesday of this year

267
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,120
 knowing just how much God you've accomplished

268
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:41,720
 in the lives of very individual people from very different backgrounds with very broken and busted stories.

269
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,440
 I'm so grateful God that

270
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,800
 you've given us the joy of being a part of that. So grateful God to you that here in this room

271
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,640
 we haven't just gathered because we want to be entertained,

272
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,040
 because we want to grow our intellect,

273
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,640
 because we want to meet new people. Yes, God, those are good reasons to gather, but God we have gathered here

274
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,800
 with the soul and singular purpose of

275
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
 seeking you.

276
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,480
 And in this season

277
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
 that's easy to do

278
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,040
 because we're reminded that you sought us

279
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,160
 first.

280
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,840
 We love you.

281
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,160
 And we sing to you now and we celebrate you Jesus,

282
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,640
 the one that would reach out

283
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:39,560
 to a lost people, would rescue us from the most broken parts of our story and would reign over us

284
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:46,280
 today, tomorrow, and forever for our good. We sing to you now in Jesus name we pray.
