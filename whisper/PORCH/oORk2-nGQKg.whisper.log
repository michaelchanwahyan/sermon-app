[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.080]   - All right, Dallas, how we doing?
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.800]   Hello, Dallas.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040]   Hello to Fort Worth and everybody else streaming online.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.780]   My name is Adam Tornow.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.960]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.420]   Thank you, that's awesome.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380]   My mom and family are up there.
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.400]   So anyway, I am excited to be here to continue
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.120]   the First Comes Love series with you guys tonight.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.960]   And tonight, I'm just gonna jump right into
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.640]   what our subject is because we got this whiteboard here.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   And so tonight is going to be a little bit of sex ed.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.320]   All right, so that's what we're gonna do tonight.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.440]   And so I know some of y'all are nervous
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.800]   'cause you're like, he's got a pen,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500]   there's a lot of white space.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.640]   There are gonna be some drawings,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.920]   but they're all tame, okay?
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.380]   So anyway, where I wanna start off tonight is,
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.300]   my story is probably very similar to your story
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.040]   when it came to sex ed.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.900]   If I look at it, I really had a lot of education growing up,
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.560]   but it was all a miseducation.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.160]   And so what I wanna do is I wanna kinda
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.940]   give you guys a little glimpse into my life
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.840]   and go through kind of the miseducation
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.140]   and the reeducation of Adam Tornow when it came to sex.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.600]   And so let's start off with some of the miseducation.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.260]   The miseducation for me started when I was seven years old
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.940]   with an incident that I will call the snowman incident.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.420]   All right?
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.760]   You might've had a snowman incident.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.920]   I practice these drawings, by the way, so there we go.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.120]   So there's the snowman incident.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.800]   So the snowman incident happened when I was seven years old
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.680]   and it was snowing, that's why there was a snowman.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.240]   It was snowing at my house where I was.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.440]   I didn't grow up here.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.880]   I grew up in the Washington, DC area.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.180]   And so it had snowed and I went outside
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.600]   to go play in the snow.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   And my next door neighbor had a snowman in their front yard
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.320]   and on that snowman, there were two older neighbor kids.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.720]   They were on that snowman tearing it down.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.640]   They were destroying it.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.700]   And so the seven year old Adam got pretty excited
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.740]   watching these older kids tear this snowman down.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.700]   And so I decided to go next door and to watch them
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640]   as they tore this snowman down.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.740]   And as they were tearing down the snowman,
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.220]   they kept saying this word over and over and over again
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.500]   that I had never heard before.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.560]   My little first grade seven year old mind
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.920]   had never, or your ears, had never heard this word.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.280]   And this was the F word, all right?
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.760]   So they kept, I'm not gonna write the whole word,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880]   I'm just gonna say F word.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   Honestly, I was about to write it.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.400]   I really was.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.640]   So that is the spirit of God at work right now in me
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.820]   to hold me back from all that.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.920]   So anyway, seven years old, I am hearing this word
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.080]   and I'm asking these guys, I'm like,
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.600]   "Hey, what is that word you're saying?"
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.440]   And they're like, "Which word?"
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.800]   And I'm like, "That one, the F word
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.640]   "that you keep saying over and over and over again
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.440]   "in probably all the wrong contexts, you know,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.160]   "using it as an adverb and an adjective and a noun
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.360]   "and all that kind of stuff."
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   And so they, in the most crass way humanly possible,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.400]   described to me what the F word really meant.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.880]   They talked about body parts
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.160]   and this is where babies came from.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.780]   I mean, they gave me the complete education
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.800]   at seven years old.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.720]   And at the end of that conversation, I'll never forget,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800]   they said, "If you don't believe us, go ask your dad."
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.720]   And so I just filed that, you know,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.800]   and so that may be some information
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.120]   that is gonna be helpful.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.940]   Well, fast forward two hours, all right?
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.940]   So I'm now in my house, we had just finished eating
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.560]   and we're getting the bedtime routine
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   is getting ready to start.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.840]   My mom is now in the bathroom giving my baby sister a bath.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.000]   My dad happened to be in the bathroom at the same time
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.080]   talking to my mom about something.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.460]   And so I remembered this word
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.680]   and that I should ask my dad.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.560]   And so I walked right into that bathroom
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.840]   and I just said, "Dad, what's F mean?"
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.040]   And my mom screamed and she's like,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.240]   covered my baby sister's ears.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.480]   My dad picked me up and like took me out into his office
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.200]   and we sat down and he said,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.360]   "Well, what do you think it means?"
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.180]   And I used all those crass words over again.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.120]   And he said, "Yes, that is a somewhat accurate description
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.640]   "of what that word means and help me say it
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   "in a little better way."
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.980]   And so from seven years old, I was, my little mind
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.400]   was now exposed because of the snowman incident
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.200]   into this world of sex.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.120]   And I learned the F word.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   So now fast forward a couple of years.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.680]   So now I'm about 10 years old.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.680]   I'm about 10 years old and my dad decides to give me a book.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.600]   And I'll never forget the title of this book.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.580]   I was 10 years old, it was right,
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.440]   I think I was in fifth grade.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.980]   And my dad comes up to me one day and he goes,
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.980]   "Here's a book that you're gonna need.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.100]   "There's some information in here
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.280]   "that's gonna be helpful for you."
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.840]   And I'll never forget the book.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.320]   It was called, "What's Happening to My Body,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.640]   "A Book for Boys."
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.920]   [congregation laughing]
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.880]   Now, I'm a little bit of a late bloomer, okay?
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.240]   And my kids still, my two boys now still make fun
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.280]   of my lack of ability to really grow a beard
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280]   or anything like that.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.800]   So I promise you at 10 years old,
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.840]   there was nothing at all happening to my body, okay?
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.520]   So this was literally just a book for boys for me.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.860]   And so I remember being handed this book
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.780]   and he just telling me, "Hey, there's some information here
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.620]   "you're gonna need."
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.840]   And so I go into my bedroom and I open up the book
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.480]   and I'm like, I see these drawings
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   of different stages of puberty
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.680]   and a husband and wife engaged in some sexual activity.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.200]   And I'm like, I do not know what this book is.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.280]   I don't even think I read all of it.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.120]   I do remember at one point going to ask my dad one question
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.340]   of like, what does this word mean?
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.840]   And it was the word circumcision.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.760]   And so we had a conversation about that.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.320]   And so I had this book and it was,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.000]   "What's Happening to My Body, A Book for Boys."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.220]   So I knew what this sexual activity was.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.140]   I knew some, now had some mental pictures in my mind,
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.940]   some drawings of what sex meant,
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.820]   but that wasn't the end of my miseducation.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.780]   The end of my miseducation happened
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.460]   when I was about 12 years old.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.620]   And it happened when I was hanging out with some friends.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.740]   And so at 12 years old was still a time here in America
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.180]   where Netflix wasn't around, DVDs weren't around.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.640]   And so if you wanted to watch a movie,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.500]   you had to go to a video store.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.140]   And so some of your parents maybe have talked to you
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.140]   about a video store, but basically a video store
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.360]   is where you went and that's where you rented videos.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.200]   And then you went home
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.580]   and then you had to take the videos back.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.580]   And so this one video store in the neighborhood
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.380]   or in the town where I was growing up in,
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.940]   my buddies and I would get on our bike.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.220]   We drive up to this video store one day
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.780]   and we knew this video store had an adult section
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.860]   and it was so seedy.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.500]   It was like back in the corner,
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.860]   there was this dark curtain that would cover up the section
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.660]   and people would sneak in there.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.260]   And the way this video store worked is out on the floor
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.700]   where all the movies that you could rent,
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.060]   it was just the cover of the movie.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.720]   You would take the cover up to the counter
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.120]   and you'd say, I wanna rent this movie.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.500]   This is ET or Raiders of the Lost Ark or whatever it is.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.540]   And then they would go back behind the counter
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.740]   on the shelves and they would take the movie off
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.740]   and they would hand it to you and that's how you rented it.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.180]   Well, one of my friends figured out
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.520]   that all of those adult movies
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.660]   that were back there behind that curtain,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.220]   where they were stored on the shelves
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.740]   was actually right by the front door.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.380]   And so he decided one day, he said,
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.700]   hey, let's go up there, let's steal one of those movies.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.220]   I'll hop over the counter, I'll grab it and we'll run out.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.760]   And as 12 year olds, we said, that sounds like fun.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.660]   So we rode our bikes up there and my friend went over there.
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.140]   He pulled that movie off the shelf.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.540]   We jumped off, or he jumped over the counter.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.540]   We got on our bikes and we went home.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.960]   His parents were not home and we plopped in that movie.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.160]   And I saw for the first time,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.120]   my first pornographic movie at the age of 12.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.600]   So I was 12 years old when that happened.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.560]   So I had heard about it when I was seven.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.360]   I had seen pictures of it when I was 10
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.240]   and now two years later at 12, all of it came together.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240]   And for the very first time,
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.300]   I saw how all of this was supposed to work.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.140]   So from the age of 12 up until the age of 21,
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.920]   my goal when it came to this new information
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.600]   that I had found, my goal was basically to consume
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.960]   as much pornography as I possibly could
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.360]   and to try to engage in as much activity
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.640]   that I saw on those movies as I could.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   And unfortunately, I had some success.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.880]   I was able to consume a lot of pornography
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.120]   from the ages of 12 until about age 21.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.760]   And unfortunately, I was able to engage
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.920]   in some inappropriate relationships with other girls.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.480]   And I just thought this was normal.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.300]   This is what all my friends were doing.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.840]   And my parents really,
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.880]   we weren't having too many conversations about it.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.200]   And I just thought, hey, I have a sex education
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.160]   and now I'm using that education.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.960]   And then it all kind of came to an end
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.080]   and it came to an end very dramatically.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.920]   And the miseducation now ended when I was 21
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.780]   and it ended when I met this guy.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:54.420]   And I'll call, and his name is John and I was 21 years old.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.400]   I was in college at the time
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.440]   and I had just become a Christian.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.480]   A guy in my fraternity had shared with me
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.600]   about this Jesus that Shane had just gotten done
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.760]   talking about and I had come to understand
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.800]   that I was a sinner in need of a Savior
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.440]   and that Savior was Jesus Christ.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.040]   And God in His grace and in His mercy,
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.260]   He opened my eyes right before my 21st birthday
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.720]   to see that I needed that Savior Jesus.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.480]   And I placed my trust in Jesus Christ
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.360]   as my Lord and Savior.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.400]   A lot of things started to change immediately
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.500]   when I came to know Jesus.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.040]   And one of the things that started to change
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.840]   is I no longer had this goal of trying to seek out
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.560]   inappropriate relationships with females.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.080]   And the only reason that that changed immediately
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.840]   is because my view of the Bible,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.280]   what I learned during my miseducation
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.160]   is my view of the Bible is that God
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.560]   did not want us to have sex.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.080]   My view of the Bible at that time was,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.220]   hey, don't do a bunch of stuff if you wanna get to heaven.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.080]   And so even though I understood
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.960]   just these early understandings of grace,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.760]   I still had this wrong view of God
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.920]   that He didn't want me to do stuff that was fun,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.160]   that He was this killjoy in the sky.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.200]   And so I still believed that,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.920]   hey, God doesn't want me to have sex,
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.680]   and so therefore I'm not gonna have sex.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.400]   But I meet this guy named John.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.660]   He starts to disciple me,
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.120]   meaning he starts to spend time with me.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.440]   He starts to teach me the Bible.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.600]   And John starts to really challenge my view of God.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.960]   He's like, Adam, he's not just this God
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.960]   that is up there trying to hold you back
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.120]   and say, hey, don't do all this kind of fun stuff.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   He's not trying to rip you off.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.960]   He's trying to set you free.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.680]   He's got views of life,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.420]   and he's got this preferred future for you,
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.080]   and he's got these ways that he wants you to walk in.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.920]   And it's not because he doesn't want you to have fun.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.360]   He wants you to walk in these ways because he loves you
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.240]   and because he knows what is best for you.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.160]   And so for a few years there in college,
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.240]   I got to spend time with John,
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.960]   and John was the first adult man that I had ever talked to
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.400]   that we had this really frank
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.160]   and healthy conversation about sex.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.060]   And he started to tell me about God's view of sex,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.140]   and he was saying things that I had never heard before,
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.640]   that sex was designed by God, that it was created by God,
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.120]   that it wasn't dirty,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.960]   that it was something that was reserved for married couples,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.800]   all this kind of stuff.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   It was all brand new based on the miseducation that I had.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.520]   And so then by the grace of God from about age 22
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.360]   until about the age 27,
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.880]   I had this great opportunity to be involved in the church.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.940]   So all the things that John had told me
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.020]   as he opened up God's word and he explained to me
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.540]   this heart of God and how much he loved us,
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.620]   I then got to sit in all these great churches
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.660]   that were continuing to faithfully open up God's word
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.180]   and teach.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.020]   And oftentimes they taught about this view,
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.620]   God's view of human sexuality.
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.940]   And it was completely different
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.120]   than anything I had ever heard before.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.660]   And then when I was 28 years old,
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.660]   by this time I had gotten into a relationship
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.940]   with a young lady named Jackie,
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.660]   and when I was 28 years old,
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.900]   we got to take a class here at Watermark.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.220]   And the class was called Merge.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.880]   And that's the logo.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.000]   Don't tell Scott, all right?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.100]   And so we were seriously dating,
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.500]   we were about ready to get engaged,
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.300]   and we wanted to take this pre-married class.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.780]   And in that class we heard about a whole bunch of subjects,
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.740]   and one of the subjects we talked about
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.660]   was physical intimacy.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.100]   And we talked about, from a biblical perspective, sex.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.500]   And I was learning for the very first time
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.740]   that sex isn't just this physical act
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.300]   that a husband and wife do or that two people do.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.020]   It's not just body parts that are touching.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.380]   That this is deeply emotional, it's even spiritual.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.460]   It's largely dependent on the quality of a relationship.
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.340]   And so all of this happened by the time that I was 28.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.340]   And by the grace of God, by the time I got married,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.400]   I not only went through a miseducation,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.140]   by the grace of God I was able to go through a re-education
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.780]   of a completely, totally different view of sex,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.100]   a biblical view of sex.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.420]   And I start with all that tonight
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.900]   because that's what I wanna do tonight.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.300]   I wanna try tonight for us to re-educate ourselves
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.220]   on this subject that has been so distorted.
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.100]   It has been, there's so many lies out there in the culture,
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.900]   and that so many of us probably have stories
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.740]   very similar to mine.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.860]   You may not have it go out the exact same way,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.020]   but I bet a lot of you would go,
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.860]   "Hey, that's my story too.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.460]   "I have had a miseducation, and by the grace of God,
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.220]   "I'm experiencing a re-education."
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.460]   And so tonight, I hope is a part of that process
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.140]   for all of us as we're re-educating our minds
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.380]   and trying to view this really sensitive
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.100]   and important subject from God's perspective.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.460]   And so hopefully that's what we're gonna be able to do.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.900]   And the reason that I start with all this,
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.700]   or one of the things that I want to say,
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.700]   why this is so important is that as I went through
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.620]   both of these educations, here's what's crazy.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.700]   I can stand up here with complete and total confidence
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.700]   and tell you the church has the best information on sex.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.900]   The best.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.540]   And there's one person really excited about that.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.380]   I hope there's gonna be a lot of you clapping
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.260]   by the end of this, and I can convince you
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.140]   that the church has the best information on sex.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.660]   I've been through, I've listened to what my friends told me,
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.380]   I've listened to what books have told me,
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.780]   and what the culture through movies would try to tell me,
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.860]   and I would tell you this,
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.060]   is that what the church teaches about sex,
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.820]   what God's word says about sex, is without a doubt,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.300]   the most helpful, the most refreshing,
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.260]   and the best information that is out there.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.980]   And I know for some of you, that sounds like crazy talk,
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.900]   but it makes complete and total sense,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.140]   because sex is not the world's idea.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.820]   It's God's idea.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.420]   And so it makes complete and total sense
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.700]   that God would have the best information about all this.
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.540]   And so what we're gonna do
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.820]   as we go through this re-education
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.380]   is we're gonna try to look at two things, really.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.020]   We're gonna just look at some of the basics.
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.020]   We can't cover all of it,
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.020]   but we're gonna look at some of the basics
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.500]   on what the biblical overview is on sex,
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.700]   and then we're gonna come down here second,
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.780]   and we're gonna look at some common misunderstandings
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.660]   that are out there.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.020]   'Cause we've all got 'em,
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.460]   and so we're gonna look at three common misunderstandings
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.300]   that are out there.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.420]   So let's go through the basics here first.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.700]   Here's some of the basics
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.100]   from a biblical perspective on sex.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.460]   The very first thing that we need to know
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.780]   is that it was that sex was created by God.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.860]   If you got your Bibles, look at this.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.860]   In Genesis chapter one, verse 28, here's what it says.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.220]   It said, "God blessed them,"
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.340]   he's talking to Adam and Eve,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.140]   "God blessed them and said to them,
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.340]   "'Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.820]   "'Fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.780]   "'Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.980]   "'and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'"
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.980]   And so here it is, 28 verses into this book, okay?
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.940]   28 verses into this book.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.300]   I don't know about you, but my guess is every single Bible,
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.420]   if you open it up, on the very first page,
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:00.580]   the very first page we see that God created sex.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.900]   He created it.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.620]   He wanted Adam and Eve, the first couple,
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.660]   to be fruitful and to multiply, to increase in number,
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.220]   to fill the earth with babies.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.380]   And so you've gotta be sitting in there,
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.220]   and if you came in here
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.740]   and you've never heard about the Bible before,
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.540]   or you've never read the Bible,
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.540]   or you're just into this Jesus thing now,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.420]   this has gotta be really good news to you,
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.580]   or very intriguing news.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.140]   I mean, I know there's some of you guys out there
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.860]   that are sitting there going, "Really, first page?"
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.380]   Like, you know, you're putting on your to-do list,
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.380]   "Read more Bible right now," okay?
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.020]   It reminds me of when I first came on staff
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.020]   here at Watermark Dallas about seven years ago,
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.620]   I spent about a year leading our foundation group ministry,
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.180]   and the foundation group ministry
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.580]   is a small group for newly married couples.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.220]   And it's a great ministry,
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.900]   and it was a lot of fun to lead it.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.300]   And part of the foundation group ministry,
[00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.740]   what you do is you read through four books.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.900]   And at the time when I was leading it,
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.860]   the books kinda changed,
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.660]   but they're all basically on the same subjects.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.860]   And so it's kind of a biblical view of marriage,
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.860]   is one book, you read a book,
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.020]   or go through a resource on how to steward your finances,
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.660]   you read a book on communication,
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.180]   and then you read a book on sex.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.140]   And so every time we would give those books
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.820]   to the married couples, to the newly married couples,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.700]   it was amazing, there'd be a stack of books there,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.580]   and the sex book was always the last book
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:15.980]   that you were to go through
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.460]   after you'd been in the group about a month,
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.700]   'cause it's a sensitive topic,
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.380]   and so you'd never really start with that book.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.860]   You just go, "All right, read these in order,"
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:24.140]   and then the last book you'll go through is the sex book.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.660]   And what I knew every time is that when those guys,
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.540]   those husbands, they got those books,
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.060]   they would drive home,
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.980]   and they would immediately just kinda look at their wife
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.860]   and just go, "I'm feeling like reading right now."
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.220]   And they would start with that sex book every single time.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.460]   They were so intrigued by the sex book,
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.660]   and by like three weeks into the foundation group,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.740]   they had already read the sex book
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.940]   because they were so intrigued by this topic,
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.140]   and it was basically what we see here in Genesis 1:28,
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.820]   is that they were just, like, God is into this,
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.340]   He created all of this.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.660]   And so that means that it's not dirty,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.820]   that means that it's good,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.380]   that it is something that has been created by God.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.260]   And so we see here in Genesis 1:28, all right?
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.100]   Now, let's keep going.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.420]   The second thing that we'll see here
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.020]   is that not only did God create sex,
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.380]   but God also commands
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.740]   married couples to have sex.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.180]   This is seen in 1 Corinthians 7, so look at this.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.940]   1 Corinthians 7, verses two and three,
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.500]   and then we'll skip down and read verse five.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.580]   "But since sexual immorality is occurring,
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.100]   "each man should have sexual relations with his own wife,
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.220]   "and each woman with her own husband.
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.140]   "The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife,
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.260]   "and likewise the wife to her husband.
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.460]   "Do not deprive each other, except perhaps by mutual consent,
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:53.220]   "and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.260]   "Then come together again, so that Satan will not tempt you
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.940]   "because of your lack of self-control."
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.980]   So the first thing we see is that God created sex,
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.980]   and so it's good, it's not dirty, it's a good thing.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.180]   The second thing that we see
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.820]   is that God commands married couples to have sex,
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.980]   and this is really fascinating to think about.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.900]   One of the reasons that he wants a married couple
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.620]   to engage in sexual activity
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.340]   is so that they can devote themselves to prayer,
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.020]   so that their minds will not be distracted,
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.540]   so that they can focus on praying.
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.740]   And so this good thing that God created,
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.900]   this good thing that he designed,
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.820]   he commands married couples,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.460]   he commands them to be able to engage in this
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.420]   so that they can focus on their relationship with God,
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.980]   so that they can pray to him.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.660]   The third thing we see here is that God deeply cares.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.740]   He cares about sex,
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.180]   and he cares about sex in the right context.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.260]   And so let's look here at Hebrews chapter 13, verse four.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.260]   Here's what the author of Hebrews says,
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.700]   one of my favorite verses about all of it,
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.580]   because there's just so much in these few words
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.060]   to describe this biblical and godly view of sex.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.140]   Here's what he says, "Marriage should be honored by all.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.460]   "It should be honored by all,
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.240]   "and the marriage bed kept pure,
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.780]   "for God will judge the adulterer
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.700]   "in all of the sexually and moral."
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.820]   And so he wants this activity to be honored by all,
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.180]   and he wants this activity to be reserved for marriage.
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.100]   And so the bottom line that we see here,
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.180]   if we look at all of these,
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.540]   and then specifically what we see here
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.820]   in Hebrews chapter 13, verse four, is this,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:39.820]   is that sex is a gift from God reserved for a married couple.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.500]   Sex is a gift from God that is given to
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.060]   and reserved for a married couple.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.820]   And so what we need to understand is it's not dirty,
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.620]   it's not something that he tells you not to do,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.260]   it is a gift that he has given in the right context,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.540]   and that is in the context of marriage.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.740]   And so this idea of marriage or sex being a gift from God,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.940]   I mean, this is something that I have got to remind myself
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.520]   over and over and over again.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.980]   This is something that Jackie and I,
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.820]   the way that we're trying to communicate this to our boys.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.100]   So I've got a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.380]   and we had the conversation with them
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.620]   before they started school last year
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.540]   of just wanting to be the first ones to describe sex to them
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.860]   so that they wouldn't have a snowman incident.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.120]   So I'll never forget that night
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.740]   that we were having the conversation with them at dinner,
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.160]   and it was one of my favorite moments
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   just because of the comedy that ensued
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.740]   as we were having that conversation with them
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.420]   and asking them, "Hey, have you ever heard of what sex is?"
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.680]   And they kind of look at us and they're like,
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.380]   "No, I don't know what that is, what is that?"
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.940]   And the very first thing we told them,
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.940]   what we wanted them to know is that sex is a gift from God
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.040]   that is reserved for a married couple.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.420]   And so they were like, "All right, well,
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.660]   "what is this gift for?"
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.580]   And we talked about, "Oh, this is where babies come from."
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.500]   And at that point, the kindergartner was just kind of like
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.340]   looking around like, "Where are babies coming from?
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.860]   "And how does that happen?"
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.580]   And you know, we're using this language,
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.780]   we're not talking about pleasure,
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.580]   we're just talking about the physical act with them,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.220]   just trying to give them some vocabulary,
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.660]   something deep inside dad goes deep inside mom,
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.380]   and the seed from inside dad
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.820]   matches with the seed inside mom,
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.860]   and then a baby is born and the baby comes out.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.180]   And at that point, I mean, the kindergartner is just like,
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:15.140]   "Can we please talk about something else right now?"
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.620]   And the first grader at that point,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.100]   or the second grader at that point
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.740]   was just very intrigued by all of this
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.760]   and just kind of grossed out at the same time.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.780]   And so we have to remind them,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.180]   we've had multiple conversations with them about this.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.140]   I mean, even as early as this Sunday,
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.500]   this Sunday, I went on a walk with my now third grader
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.180]   and he was talking about something
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.020]   in a song that he heard that maybe mentioned sex,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.380]   and he talked about how sex was bad,
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.620]   and I just corrected him again to say,
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.580]   "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.220]   "remember, sex isn't bad.
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.060]   "Remember what we say,
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:45.260]   "sex is a gift from God reserved for married couples."
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.780]   If you're married, then sex is good.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.860]   And what I love about this verse
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.220]   is that we're seeing the flip side of that,
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.300]   that context matters,
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.260]   context matters when it comes to whether or not
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.320]   God views sex positively or negatively.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.960]   In the context of marriage,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.640]   then sex is something that is to be richly enjoyed,
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.160]   but when you get out of the context of marriage,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.980]   sex is something that Scripture is incredibly clear
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.820]   is deeply troubling.
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.020]   And you see it right here in this verse,
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.780]   "So the marriage bed should be honored by all,
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.180]   "the marriage bed kept pure."
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.460]   So that's in the right context of marriage,
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.860]   it should be richly enjoyed.
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.700]   But then God is going to judge,
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.120]   and then we see two words here to describe
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.700]   sexual activity that takes place
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.740]   outside of the context of marriage.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.380]   God is going to judge the adulterer.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.700]   An adulterer is somebody who has sex with somebody
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.500]   who is not their spouse.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.400]   You have sex with another married person
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:40.300]   that is not your spouse, that's what an adulterer is.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.260]   And that is viewed negatively here.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.040]   And all the sexually immoral.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.380]   And so sexual immorality,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.040]   if you go and you read through the New Testament,
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.380]   that's one of the words that is used over and over again,
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.220]   and usually in a negative connotation to describe sex.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.900]   What the author of Hebrews here is using,
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.240]   and Paul uses it, and again,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.380]   it's all throughout the New Testament,
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.140]   when you run across the word sexual immorality
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.220]   or the sexually immoral,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.380]   what that is in the original language,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.580]   in the Greek language when the New Testament was written,
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.860]   that is the Greek word porneia.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.980]   And that is where we get the English word pornography from.
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   In your Bibles, it is translated sexual immorality.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.320]   Sexual immorality or porneia, what it is,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.820]   it's this kind of this junk drawer of a word
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.160]   that describes any and all sexual activity
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.240]   that takes place outside of the context of marriage.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.160]   All of that is sexual immorality, it's all porneia.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.500]   So this would be sex with your boyfriend or your girlfriend,
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.720]   oral sex, casual sex, masturbation, friends with benefits,
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.680]   pornography, raunchy films, strip clubs,
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.360]   all of that is porneia.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.360]   It's all a cheap imitation of something that God designed
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.960]   and a gift that he gave for married couples.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.280]   It's not the real deal, a cheap imitation.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.440]   It's like turkey bacon.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.040]   Like who cares, right?
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.240]   Like what's that worth?
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.960]   It's all porneia.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.840]   In the context of marriage,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.120]   in the context of marriage, sex is good.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.420]   It's to be richly enjoyed.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.160]   When you take it out of marriage,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.520]   it can be deeply troubling.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.260]   And so basically, the basics, what we need to know
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.760]   is we need to know this, is that you can trust,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.460]   you can trust the designer.
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:38.720]   You can trust the designer.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.060]   And you know what, we all know this is true.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.320]   We get this, we experience things like this all the time.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.640]   I mean, if you ever buy an appliance from Home Depot
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.800]   or from Lowe's, or you ever go buy a big piece
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.720]   of electronic equipment or something from Best Buy,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.920]   you know, every time you go buy something from Home Depot
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.520]   or Lowe's or from Best Buy, and you get it home
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.480]   and you open it up, there are always instructions
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.840]   in that box telling you exactly how to use that dishwasher,
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   how to use that refrigerator, how to use that DVD player,
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.200]   how to use that iPhone, or how to use any of those things.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.320]   And the reason why the instructions are in that box
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.160]   and they don't come from Best Buy,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.280]   and they don't come from Lowe's,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.760]   and they don't come from Home Depot,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.780]   is because those stores know that the designers
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.960]   of those products know the best information
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.100]   about those products.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.560]   And so Home Depot doesn't want you calling them
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.080]   if you can't install the dishwasher,
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.300]   they want you calling the manufacturer
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.720]   because the designer knows best how to install that
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.840]   and knows best how to work it.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.240]   And the exact same thing is true for us with sex.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.160]   We can trust the designer.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.520]   It's his idea, it's God's idea.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.540]   So we can trust him.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.920]   He's not trying to rip us off, he's trying to set us free.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   He knows the best way that this gift was intended to be used.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.520]   And so the summary of the basics is this,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.440]   is that we can trust the designer.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.040]   Now, let's go and move on to the second movement here
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.160]   and the second act of all of this.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.720]   And now let's start to think about some
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.840]   of the misunderstandings that are out there,
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.360]   'cause there were a lot of misunderstandings
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.120]   that I had about sex as I went through my miseducation,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.160]   that I had to relearn or unlearn
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.520]   as I went through the reeducation.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.280]   So again, we could be up here all night
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.900]   and talk about 20 or 30 misunderstandings
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.200]   and we just don't have time to do that.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.000]   So let's just talk about three of them.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.200]   And the first one that I wanna talk about is this idea
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.880]   that's out there that practice makes perfect.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.200]   This idea that practice makes perfect is a misunderstanding.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.800]   It is just not true.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.240]   Now, I understand why many of us would think
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.520]   that practice makes perfect,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.520]   because we are concerned about this thing
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.660]   that we like to call sexual compatibility.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.520]   Sexual compatibility, that's one of the things
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.420]   that maybe some of you that are not married
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:50.260]   that you're worried about is,
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.800]   "Hey, if I get married and I'm gonna be monogamous
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.200]   and I'm gonna have a sexual relationship
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.360]   with just one person,
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.760]   I wanna make sure that I'm compatible with that person.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.600]   So therefore I should probably practice
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.880]   or I should try before I buy here."
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.680]   And so I understand the reasoning behind all of that,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.000]   but let me just remind you of something
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.080]   that I know you've heard from this stage multiple times.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.160]   When it comes to sexual compatibility,
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.800]   you do not have to worry.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.960]   If you are a man and you marry a woman,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.620]   you are compatible sexually, okay?
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.520]   You're not just gonna be sexually compatible
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.720]   with one person.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   You are sexually compatible with millions of people, okay?
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.160]   So you do not have to worry about sexual compatibility
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.400]   and use that as an excuse to engage in sexual activity
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.800]   outside of the context of marriage.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.440]   And so sexual compatibility though,
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.820]   I think what a lot of us don't understand
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.280]   about sexual compatibility
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.660]   is that it doesn't have nearly as much to do
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.760]   with the physical side of the relationship
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.880]   as it has to do with the relational
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.120]   or the emotional side of the relationship.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.480]   And so compatibility is mostly relational.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   It's not mostly physical.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.080]   And so I wanna prove this to you guys with some numbers,
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.560]   okay, so before I became a pastor
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.760]   and came on staff here at Watermark,
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.320]   I was a CPA for 10 years and so I love numbers.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.280]   And so I was sitting there thinking about this one day
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.600]   and I just had this thought.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.740]   And the thought was this,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.840]   is how much time does the average married couple spend
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.640]   engaged in sex, okay?
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.480]   Like how much time?
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.880]   I know I had what my eighth grade dream was
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.920]   of how much time a married couple would spend
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.960]   engaged in sex and I was just sitting there going,
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.000]   all right, like how much time is it really?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Like let's put some numbers down on the paper
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.840]   and let's look at it.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.160]   So we were checking out some stats today
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.720]   about how many times the average married couple has sex.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.040]   And so let's just for argument's sake today,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.000]   let's say that the average couple
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.560]   engages in sexual activity six times a month, okay?
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.000]   Let's just say for argument's sake, six times a month.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And let's say with those six times
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.480]   that every time the couple engages,
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.560]   let's say the entire process lasts 30 minutes, okay?
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   Now, and when I say entire process,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.880]   I mean like from brushing your teeth
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.480]   all the way to getting dressed again
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.240]   and going back and turning on the television, okay?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.920]   Like the entire process lasting 30 minutes.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.880]   So six times a month, six times a month,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.760]   and if it's 30 minutes each time,
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.320]   that is 180 minutes a month, okay?
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.240]   Now, multiply that by 12 over a year
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.760]   and what that comes out to
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.760]   is that comes out to 2,160 minutes a year.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:46.200]   Average married couple would spend engaged in sex, okay?
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.420]   Anybody know off the top of their head
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.440]   how many minutes there are in a year?
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.440]   Glad you asked.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.320]   525,600 minutes, okay?
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.040]   You don't have to be a numbers person to know,
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.440]   you are not gonna like the answer to this, okay?
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.820]   So let's take this, let's do the math, all right?
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.320]   If the average married couple spends 2,160 minutes a year
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.640]   engaged in sex and there are 525,600,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.560]   [congregation laughing]
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.860]   525,600 minutes in a year,
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.360]   what that means is this,
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.280]   that means that the average married couple spends
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.640]   0.41% of their year having sex.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.620]   Now, let's just be generous
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.300]   'cause you guys are gonna be different, right?
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.120]   Let's just round that up.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.080]   You all are gonna be different.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.440]   Let's just round it up to 1%, okay?
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.560]   I'm giving you twice as much sex as the average, okay?
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.480]   So let's just imagine you're gonna have 1%.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.540]   So if you can double the average,
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.780]   if you can double the average,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.780]   you will spend as a married couple 1% of your year
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.160]   engaged in sexual activity.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.260]   Let me show you another number.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   That means you will spend 99% of your life
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:17.140]   not having sex, okay?
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.940]   Sex, okay?
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.220]   Emphasis on not, all right?
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.460]   So here's what this means.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.880]   Here's what this means.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.940]   This means that sexual compatibility
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.480]   has a whole lot more to do with the 99%
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.420]   than it does with the 1% because it's relational.
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   It's not merely physical.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.520]   And what's crazy for me,
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.580]   and you guys can identify this,
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.600]   those of you that are not married,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.040]   is that average dating couples,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.880]   as a dating couple,
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   it seems like you spend 99% of your time
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.600]   trying to avoid something
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.440]   that you will spend 1% of your time doing
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   as a married couple.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.160]   This is an incredibly important 1% of a relationship,
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.640]   but you better believe that that 1% is directly impacted
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.280]   by the quality of the 99%.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.360]   Compatibility is not just a physical thing.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.560]   Compatibility is a relational thing.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.060]   And if you wanna be able to be compatible,
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.780]   then you better be focused on the 99%.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.980]   So this idea that practice makes perfect
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.340]   really is not true at all.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.580]   But, well, let me qualify that a little bit.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.020]   There is one group where practice does make perfect,
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.980]   and that is when you get married.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.700]   When you get married, practice does make perfect.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.420]   And I got another kind of discouraging statistic for you.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.600]   It's this, is that when researchers,
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.500]   marriage researchers,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.460]   when they poll married couples
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.180]   and try to figure out which married couple,
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.380]   which age group is the most sexually satisfied,
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.060]   the studies consistently show
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.460]   that the most sexually satisfied couples
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.220]   are in their 50s and 60s.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.100]   That's your parents' age, okay?
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.100]   So I'll just let you throw open your mouth for a second.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.820]   Let's get over all that.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.340]   Makes total sense to me, though.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.300]   Makes total sense to me,
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.260]   because they're focused on the 99%.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:23.300]   And you grow, and you continue to make progress in that.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.880]   You don't bless your spouse with practice.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.940]   You bless your spouse with purity.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:35.260]   Because when you're pure, when you're pure,
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.100]   when you're avoiding sexual activity,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.900]   you know what you're focused on?
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.920]   The relationship.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.740]   The relationship.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.260]   And when you're focusing on the relationship,
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.380]   you know what you're really focusing on,
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.020]   what's eventually gonna possibly help,
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.340]   is that's gonna help with compatibility.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.060]   So the first misunderstanding that's out there
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.340]   for many of us is this idea that practice makes perfect.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.960]   And what I want us to see as we're reeducating ourselves
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.380]   is that practice does not make perfect.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.140]   Purity is what we are to do.
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.940]   The second one is this.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.620]   Second misconception that's out there
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.940]   is that if we wait,
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.860]   if we wait, then sex will be great.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.500]   This idea, if we wait, then sex will be great.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.300]   And some of you, maybe if you grew up in the church,
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.460]   you have heard this, or you've believed this.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.180]   Maybe this is what your youth pastor told you,
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.500]   or your parents told you, to try to convince you
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.980]   to remain pure, to remain a virgin.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.600]   This idea that, hey, when you get married,
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.860]   if you're a virgin when you get married,
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.700]   then sex is going to be great.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.180]   And I just wanna kinda bust that myth here
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.020]   to let you know this, that if you wait,
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.320]   that is not a guarantee that sex will be great.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.660]   The worst year of sex for just about every married couple,
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.860]   the worst year of sex is the first year of sex.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.080]   And it makes total sense 'cause if you're a virgin
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.580]   when you get married, then that makes sense
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.580]   that that first year of sex is going to be
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.860]   a little awkward and unusual,
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.440]   and you got all this vulnerability
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.320]   that you've gotta work through
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.700]   and how to communicate about this.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.820]   And so that makes sense that it's gonna be work.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.980]   But what's interesting is even if you've had sex before,
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.980]   that first year of sex is the worst year of sex.
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.480]   And the reason why is because just because
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.240]   you've had sex before you got married
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   does not mean that you know what you're doing.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.500]   Because if you've had sex before you've gotten married,
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.200]   you've been messing around with the cheap alternative.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.340]   If you think just because you've had sex
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.140]   before you get married that that area of your life
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   is gonna be perfect, that line of thinking
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.380]   is just as crazy as if my two boys when they turned 16,
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.580]   if they were gonna come up to me and go,
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:37.620]   "You know what, Dad?
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.020]   "We don't have to take driver's ed.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.300]   "We think we know how to drive."
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.140]   And I'd be like, "Really?
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.960]   "Why don't you think you need to take driver's ed?
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.980]   "How do you know how to drive?"
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.040]   They go, "We got it.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.380]   "We know how to drive.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.300]   "We totally crush Mario Kart."
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.700]   All right?
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.780]   We totally crush Mario Kart.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.860]   We finished in first and second place every time.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.480]   We know how to drive.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.020]   And so now I don't need to take driver's education.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.200]   I just need to go take the test because I'm a good driver.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.220]   That's crazy talk.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.780]   Mario Kart is a cheap imitation of the real thing.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.500]   And if they think they know how to drive
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.060]   just 'cause they can play Mario Kart,
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.300]   they're gonna be sorely mistaken
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.740]   when they get behind the wheel of a real car.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.700]   And just because you've been messing around
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.260]   with the cheap imitation of the real thing
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.400]   does not mean you know,
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.700]   you know what this thing is that God intended.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.240]   If you wait, it doesn't necessarily mean
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.140]   that sex will be great.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.940]   I think if you wait, you're gonna be happy that you did.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.240]   I think there's gonna be a lot less baggage
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.200]   that you're gonna be dealing with.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.660]   I think there's gonna be a lot less guilt
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.160]   and a lot less shame.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.780]   But don't wait.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.280]   Don't wait just to put God on the line
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.680]   because maybe he owes you a good sex life.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.120]   Wait.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.840]   Wait as an act of trust and obedience in worship.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.260]   Wait because you believe that God is good
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.460]   and that he is for you and he's not trying to rip you off.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:02.400]   Don't wait because you think he's gonna owe you something.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.840]   Wait for the right reason.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.500]   And the last misconception that's out there
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.700]   is just this idea that marriage
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.540]   is gonna satisfy.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:21.940]   That marriage is gonna satisfy your sexual desires.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.640]   And unfortunately, that's not true either.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.300]   And again, that line of thinking makes sense
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.340]   that, hey, I've got all these sexual desires right now.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.940]   I've got this lust that I'm struggling with.
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.160]   I've got all these hormones that are going crazy right now.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.980]   And the reason that I'm struggling with these desires
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.640]   is because I don't have a sexual outlet.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.580]   Therefore, if when I'm married
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.860]   and I do have a sexual outlet,
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.420]   then those desires will go down
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.780]   and I'm not gonna struggle that much anymore.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.700]   Makes total sense, that line of thinking,
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.500]   but I'm just telling you, it's not true.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   And the reason it's not true
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.420]   is because your sexual desires, that sex drive that's there,
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.980]   that lust, it's not a physical issue.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.880]   It's a heart issue.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.200]   And heart issues are not fixed by marriage.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.720]   Heart issues are not addressed by marriage.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.620]   Heart issues are fixed and addressed by Jesus.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.340]   And so what we do right now,
[00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.900]   what we do right now while we're struggling
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.260]   is we believe what Paul said
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.900]   in the 1 Thessalonians 4, verses three and five.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.260]   Look at this.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.740]   He says, "It is God's will that you should be sanctified,
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:27.240]   "that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.060]   "that each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.300]   "in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.900]   "not in passionate lust like the pagans
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.460]   "who do not know God."
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:44.260]   If you can't control those desires and those urges
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.600]   and those lusts right now,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.360]   then if you get married,
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.740]   you're gonna have trouble controlling them then too.
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.220]   Now is the time.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.580]   Now is the time to start battling those urges.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.460]   Now is the time to start battling those desires.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.160]   Now is the time to work on your heart.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:10.260]   And I am so grateful that God gave me these years up here.
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.200]   And I'm so grateful for this season
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.140]   when I was dating Jackie and trying to battle these desires
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.140]   and learning God's heart for sexuality
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.060]   and learning that He doesn't just say no,
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.800]   He's saying, "Hey, I want this to be done
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   "in the right context."
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.460]   I am so grateful for those years
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.860]   when I was able to learn how to battle these desires
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.160]   and learn that these desires are not the ultimate in life.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:35.540]   Because those are tactics
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.020]   and those are skills that I have had to use
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.740]   every single, just about every single day
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:42.940]   since I've been married.
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.700]   And so you learn to battle that stuff now.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:47.540]   It makes me think about this.
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.020]   When my wife and I, when we first got married,
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.280]   one of our hobbies, because we had no kids and no pets,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.240]   is that we ran marathons.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.840]   And so we would train for marathons.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.000]   And I remember the very first time
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.300]   we were training for a marathon,
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.080]   I thought that training for a marathon
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.560]   would make the running of the marathon easier.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.000]   And it doesn't.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.440]   The training for a marathon
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.300]   doesn't make the running of a marathon easier.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.680]   When you train for a marathon,
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.640]   it is still really, really difficult to run
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.960]   26.2 miles in a row.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.320]   The training for the marathon
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.240]   didn't make the marathon running easier.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.700]   The training for the marathon
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.860]   got you more mentally prepared
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.260]   for the running of the race.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.100]   You knew what it was like to feel
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.060]   or you knew how it felt
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.500]   when you were starting to run low on fuel.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.720]   You knew how it felt
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.840]   when you needed to take a break and walk.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.120]   You knew how it felt
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.320]   when mentally you were starting to get discouraged.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.100]   And so you had trained for those moments
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.140]   so that when you faced them,
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.340]   you had all the skills you needed
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.940]   to be able to battle those.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.320]   And this idea that marriage
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.240]   is gonna satisfy all of those urges
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.320]   is just false now.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.080]   This is when you start to work on it.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.920]   So these misunderstandings really
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.600]   can be summarized this way,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.960]   that it's not about practice makes perfect,
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.060]   it's not about wait
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.600]   and that's gonna make sex life great,
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.440]   and it's not that,
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.760]   hey, I'm just waiting until I get married
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.220]   and then all these urges and desires
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.060]   are gonna go away.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.940]   The way that we could summarize
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.200]   the right way to look at this
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.960]   is to pursue purity.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.040]   That's what this season is for.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.520]   So I don't know what your miseducation looked like
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:23.960]   or what reeducation you need.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.840]   I don't know if you had similar instances
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:26.680]   like I did
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.720]   or you're in the middle
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.520]   of going through your reeducation right now,
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.960]   but for every single one of us,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.780]   what we need to do
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.840]   is we need to be able to trust the designer
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.640]   and understand that marriage is a gift from God
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:37.480]   or excuse me,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.300]   sex is a gift from God
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.200]   reserved for married people
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.880]   and we can pursue purity
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.800]   in this time right now
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.000]   when we are not married.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.400]   And so I'll close with this last story,
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.040]   this last weekend,
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.480]   my family and I,
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.280]   we went camping with our community group.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.360]   There were five couples and 17 kids.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.240]   We went over to Mineral Wells State Park
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.920]   and I'm not a camping guy,
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.000]   I'm not an outdoor guy.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.320]   So there's a lot of things
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.640]   that I do not like about camping.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.760]   I've never been able to sleep in a tent.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.080]   My wife and I realized this weekend
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.020]   after another sleepless night in our tent
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.340]   that we have spent many more hours awake
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.320]   inside of our tent
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.560]   than we have asleep inside of our tent.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.800]   And so camping is very difficult for me
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.040]   because I get tired
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.760]   and I'm not sleeping well.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.560]   It's dirty,
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.400]   it's hot,
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.960]   there are bugs all over the place.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.320]   I noticed this weekend
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.160]   that I just kind of give up on life
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   when I'm camping.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.040]   I don't change my clothes,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.920]   I don't brush my teeth,
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.820]   I like, I don't comb my hair.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.400]   I'm just like, what does it matter?
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.240]   We're out here in the wild right now.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.520]   I'm gonna get dirty again.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.820]   My wife, before she went to bed,
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.940]   she's like, I'm gonna go wash my face
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.780]   and brush my teeth.
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.620]   And I'm like, why?
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.580]   What does it matter?
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.080]   And I just give up on life when we're there.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.720]   I just, I don't like camping
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.540]   and that's a whole nother issue.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.140]   But there is one part of camping
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:58.980]   that I really do like
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.820]   that is my favorite,
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.180]   one of my favorite things to do in life
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.720]   and that's at night
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.000]   after the 17 kids go to bed
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.160]   and all the adults are around.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.040]   What I love doing
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.320]   is I love getting around the campfire.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.220]   There's just something mesmerizing about it.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.020]   So you sit around the campfire
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.860]   and it's amazing.
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:15.680]   You got the fire there
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.100]   and it's just interesting to watch
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.180]   and you can cook, make the s'mores
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.340]   and just seems like around a campfire,
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.800]   there's, you're never short of conversation.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.920]   It's always something to say.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.660]   The conversation is great.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.740]   The warmth is there.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:30.940]   It brings people together
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.900]   and it's just an awesome experience.
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.900]   And so as I was looking at our campfire this weekend,
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.600]   the thought just kind of dawned on me
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.640]   that right now this campfire is contained.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.380]   There's these stones all around here
[00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.340]   and that campfire is right there
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.580]   and we're all gathered around it
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.580]   and it's providing warmth and life for us
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.060]   and we're making these s'mores
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.460]   and we're having great conversation
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.300]   and we're all around it.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.620]   It's great.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.300]   But if that fire moved,
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.300]   if it moved just a few feet over to the right,
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.940]   if it went up just a little bit higher
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.040]   and caught that tree,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.580]   you take that thing that is so contained right there
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.420]   in that fire pit
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.900]   and brings so much joy and so much life.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.780]   If you take it
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.500]   and you move it out of its context,
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.900]   it could reap just so much destruction so quickly.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.180]   If you guys saw the headlines,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.940]   this is what's going on out in California right now.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.380]   Out in Sonoma and Napa Valley right now in that area,
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.600]   I wrote down some stats of what's going on there right now.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.460]   These fires are going crazy out there right now.
[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.560]   Right now they've consumed,
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.840]   as of about five o'clock today,
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.960]   they've consumed an area
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.580]   that's three times the size of Washington, DC.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.220]   This fire is moving at a rate
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.780]   where it's moving 300 yards in about three seconds.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.180]   That's how fast it's moving.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:50.700]   Over 20,000 homes have been destroyed.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.420]   15 people have lost their lives in this fire.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:59.180]   It's amazing that fire is this thing
[00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.740]   that when it's in the right context,
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.060]   when it's in a fireplace or it's in a campfire,
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:05.900]   it's in a fire pit,
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:09.460]   can provide so much life, so much joy,
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.220]   provide warmth and bring people together.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.300]   But if you take it out of its context,
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   it can cause destruction, it can cause damage,
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.260]   and it can ruin lives and leave scars.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.600]   And the exact same thing is true about sex.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.620]   In the right context, in marriage,
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.700]   it can be this beautiful thing
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.620]   that can draw people together,
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.180]   it can draw a husband and wife together,
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.840]   that can bring new life,
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.420]   something where you can enjoy
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.700]   this deep intimacy with one another.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:48.740]   And it's amazing when it's in the right context of marriage.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.260]   But when you take it out of the right context,
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.420]   when you take it out of marriage
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.460]   and it involves sexual immorality or it involves adultery,
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:59.340]   it's damage, just like fire.
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:04.340]   It destroys lives, it destroys people's paths,
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.720]   and it leaves an unbelievable scar on so many.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.700]   We can trust the designer and we can pursue purity, amen?
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.640]   Amen, let me pray for us.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.840]   God, thank you so much
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.760]   for the gift that you have given.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:30.320]   And God, we recognize that although sex is a great
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.880]   and an amazing gift that you have given to married couples,
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.520]   it is nowhere close to the ultimate gift.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.820]   And that ultimate gift is the gift you gave us
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.360]   in your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:45.020]   And so I thank you, Lord.
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.100]   I thank you for Jesus.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.020]   I thank you that we can be forgiven
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.180]   and that we can be redeemed.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.820]   And I thank you, Lord,
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.860]   and because he has risen,
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.260]   that we now can pursue purity in this season,
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.420]   that we can trust you in this season,
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.960]   that we can follow your path,
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.380]   and we do not have to follow the ways
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.100]   of the world on this subject.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:09.820]   So God, I pray for my friends in this room.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.460]   I pray that they will reject the lies that they have heard.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.560]   I pray for my friends that still need some more reeducation,
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.060]   that you will bring people into their lives,
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.540]   that your word will speak into their hearts
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.780]   and that it will help them as they are reeducated,
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.100]   to have the right and proper view of this amazing gift
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.660]   that you've given to humanity.
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.360]   And so God, we thank you.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.140]   We can come together and then we can talk about this
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.340]   and that your word guides us and instructs us.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.940]   And so we need help and we ask for it.
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.120]   And we ask this in Jesus's name, amen.
