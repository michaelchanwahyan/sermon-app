00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Every time Kanye makes me want to go into "We Are War With Terrorism."

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Just go into it.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hey, welcome! If you are listening in, you're so confused because copyright laws do not allow us to play that song online.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 But that was Kanye and the "Jesus Walks" song as we continue the series "Jesus Walks."

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Any Diet Coke fans in the room? That feels like a left turn.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Yes.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Wow, there's a lot of animosity towards Diet Coke. Good grief, people.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I'm a big Diet Coke fan.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And if I was going to drink a soda, I'm going to choose Diet Coke all the time.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 My wife will make fun of me.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And she's always like, "Why would you choose Diet Coke?"

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And I don't know why there's like a bad rap on Diet Coke.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 It feels like a very clear option to me.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 You got one soda that has zero calories in it.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And then you got one that's got 180.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Why would you choose?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Like people are like, "Dude, that's not manly to drink Diet Coke."

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 It feels like it's stupid to not drink Diet Coke.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Why? Because the options are this.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And I know the aspartame and whatever that's doing is not exactly probably great.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 But when it comes down to the option of the two drinks, I'm like, "Dude, I'm going to go with that every single time."

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It's like this is calorie free.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Or I can like hit the treadmill for an extra two hours to do that.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 This feels like a no-brainer.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And the reason why is because like for me, I'm going, "Hey, it feels like it."

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Look, it's not as good as real soda.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 That's probably the biggest knock against it.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 But it's pretty good.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 You know, it's not that bad.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And it doesn't come with nearly as much of kind of the side effects or consequences or the calories that come with it.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And you're sitting here, you're probably wondering, "What is this? Can we get to the Bible already, Pastor?"

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 I'm going somewhere and it's it's it's because here's why I introduced that.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 In the same way that in that scenario or with me, I'm like, "Dude, it's not nearly as good as the real thing."

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But it's pretty good, you know, doesn't come with all the all the calories included.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's a way that a lot of us think about the Christian life.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's like, "Hey, it's not nearly, you know, following Jesus.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's not nearly as fun or as good as the real life out there to do whatever you want would be awesome.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But it's not that bad and you don't go to hell."

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And that's pretty cool.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And that there's people in the room, like that's how people think about Christianity.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 They're like, "Hey, look, no, of course, we all know Diet Coke is not as good as the real thing.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But, you know, it's it's it's not that bad and doesn't have the calories."

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 "Hey, Christianity, look, the Christian life is, I mean, we all know it's not as good as the real thing

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 or the real life of doing whatever you want to all the time.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But, you know, it's not terrible and and you don't go to hell."

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And a lot of us think that way.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 That we think that, hey, that the Christian life isn't as good.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It's not the abundant life.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 It's not as great as as doing whatever you would want to do.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's not as it's not really the greatest life that you can experience.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 But, you know, it's kind of close.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 It's in the ballpark and it has some perks.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And you are so, and I, to any degree that I believe that, have been so misled.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 The extreme of someone believing that idea of like, hey, the Christian life, you know, it's not that great.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 But you get to go to heaven someday and not hell.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And it's close.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It's not at all what the Bible presents.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Some of us walked in the room.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 That's what we think Christ is offering us.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 That's what we think the Christian life really is.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 It's like, it's not Diet Coke.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 It's kind of diet life is how we think about it.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 We're like, yeah, it's in the ballpark.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But really, it's all about the next one.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And the other extreme is that maybe you didn't come into the room believing that.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Maybe you came in the room and you believe the Christian life is really, you know, it's not that big of a deal.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And it really doesn't matter.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It also is all about eternity.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But you can kind of live however you want right now.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 As long as you trust in Jesus, you prayed the prayer, you get to go to heaven when you die.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 You can have sex in a windmill all you want.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 It doesn't even matter.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Some people are so confused right now.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 But is that it?

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I mean, is that what it is?

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It's like, hey, I can do what I want when I want.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I know where I'm going when I die.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And it doesn't matter what I do.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And Jesus doesn't even really care about it because Jesus does love me.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Let me be abundantly clear.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Jesus loves everyone in this room and everyone who said any sentence is close to what I said just now.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 But that's also not the Christian life.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And so some of us are going to walk in the room and we came into the room tonight.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 We're buying a bill of goods on either side that we think, hey, Christian life, it's really not that great.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 But, you know, you've got to do it if you want to go to heaven.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Or we think, hey, it doesn't matter how you live.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I can live however I want, do whatever I want, whoever I want.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Doesn't even matter.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And both of those are missing what Christ says he calls us to in experiencing the abundant life, the best life you could possibly experience.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Both of those in error miss out on what Jesus says he ultimately came to invite and to call you into.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And both of those candidly, like here's the challenge.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 If you fall in either of those extremes, if you're the person who's like, dude, I do whatever I want with whoever I want.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 You can't tell me nothing else.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Or if you're the person who's like, look, I don't love following Jesus in this kind of diet life, but it's as good as it gets.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Both of those have their downsides.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 If you follow those lines of thinking, on the one hand, you're going to miss out not just in this life,

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 but in the eternity to come.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 If you just go through the motions of saying, hey, life is not that great, but I guess it's just what we have to do.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So I don't go to hell.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 You're going to find yourself depressed.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You're going to find following Jesus is exhausting.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Is anything but what Jesus says when he's like, hey, put on my yoke.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 My burden is easy and light.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Come to me if you're thirsty.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 That's not going to be where you're experiencing.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You're going to be experiencing.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Hey, I guess I just have to.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 If God's going to love me, if I'm going to have eternal life.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So that's the one side.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And then on the other side, if you like, I'm going to live however I want with whoever I want.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 You are going to either likely.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 You have bought some version of Christianity that's not Christianity at all, or you're going to live just for this life and for all of eternity.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 There's going to be a way in which you regret not having stewarded and lived in line with God's will and God's way.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And so both of those fall short and fail to really capture the essence of what Jesus said when he was on this planet.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Here's what I've come and the life that I'm inviting you to.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And there's errors in which both of us or many of us have fallen for some of the lies contained in both of those.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So tonight we're going to look at a story as we continue to series.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Jesus walks that captures the heart of what Jesus said.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Here's the life that I'm calling you to.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Here's what you can know.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Here's what you can expect, both in this life and in the life to come.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's a very famous story.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Jesus walks.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 If you just joining us is serious.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 We just kicked off a couple weeks ago where our heart for the next six weeks is to capture some of the most meaningful encounters that we see Jesus having with people inside of the New Testament.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And our hope is that you see Jesus that all of us kind of walk away going, wow, that's what when God was on this planet, when the Savior walked around God in a bod on this planet, walking around, interacting with people.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Here's what he looked like.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Here's what the God who's there is like, because we're told that Jesus is God.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And our heart is that over the next six weeks, you're seeing more and more of what the Savior who's there is like.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And more and more align yourself and align ourselves with the reality of what he says, where life is found.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 So tonight we're going to be in Mark chapter 10.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 We're going to look at a dude.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 If there was ever a most eligible bachelor award in the Bible.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Other than Jesus, it would be the guy we're going to look at.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 His name has been famously called the rich young ruler.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 This guy is the total package, ladies and gentlemen.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 He's got riches.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 He is young.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 He is a ruler, which just basically means he's part of the religious synagogue.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He had influence.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 This dude is the guy that you want to bring home to your mom.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 He's the guy that you grow up thinking, oh, if only I could have dated someone like him when he lived.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 This little rich young ruler.

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 The community around would have said like, man, that's an upstanding citizen.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 This is Tim Tebow, if you will.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And only not a Christian.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And but that's who the man that we're going to see is.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And he asked some very relevant questions.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And in the dialogue that he has with Jesus, we are given a vision into what Jesus says life ultimately is about.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And how if you follow either of those different directions of, hey, I'm going to work my way to God or it's really not that great, but I guess I have to.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Or, hey, I'm going to do whatever I want.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You're going to fall short of experiencing the life that he calls you to.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 So we're going to look at three observations really from this story.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It's in Mark chapter 10.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 This story is included three times in the Bible.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Not a lot of stories that are like that.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Three different times.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Matthew includes it.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Mark includes it.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And Luke includes it.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Matthew includes.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 So in other words, it's a story that God wants to make sure, you know, that his people learn from.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 That is recorded for all of history for people to observe and see what God's heart for the life that he's called you to experience.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 So we'll start in verse 17 and go from there.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 As he, that's Jesus, was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So in Luke's gospel, we're told that he is a ruler.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 In Matthew's gospel, we're told that he's young.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And all three of them eventually said that he's a very rich man.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 So, again, total package.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 He's the guy that you want to be.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 If you're a fellow in the room, he's the guy that you want to marry.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 If you're a lady, you would think.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Runs up to Jesus, kneels before him.

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And he asked him, good teacher.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 What must I do to inherit eternal life?

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And Jesus said to him, why do you call me good?

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 No one is good except God alone.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Jesus stops.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He doesn't even immediately answer the question.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It's kind of funny if you read it on the surface like, Jesus, what are you saying right there?

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 He's trying to address a fundamental flaw in this guy's worldview that, hey, are you equating me with God?

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 You know that no one on the planet is good but God, right?

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So are you calling me God?

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Is that what you're saying right now?

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Because there isn't anyone who is good except for God alone.

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And he is addressing a flawed perspective that many people still today believe that there are good people, there are bad people,

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 that goodness is something that you can achieve if you're a good enough person in the way that you behave.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And Jesus says, hey, hey, hey, listen.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Let's all get on the same page here really quick.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You know that nobody ever who's ever lived is good, right, except for God.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And he's addressing a man who would go on in a few sentences later to be like, hey, he basically had an identity that he thought he was good.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And Jesus right off the bat says, hey, if you're going to know the life that God calls you to, you need to know that there's only one who is good.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 There's never been a person who's lived up to the standard of God's definition of what goodness is.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 The first idea really from the text and really that the Bible over and over emphasizes is the idea that you are going to the Christian life is all about you just pursuing being good is a lie.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 The goal of the Christian life is not just you being good.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Jesus did not come to make bad people good or decent people gooder.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He came to make dead people alive, to make people new, to totally transform.

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 He didn't come to some like, hey, I'm going to come in there and kind of renovate just a little bit this fixer upper.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 He came to tear down the house and in its place put something entirely new he's building and creating.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 The Christian life, and you need to know if you're going to ever become a Christian or if you're in the room and you would say to be a Christian, in order to trust in a savior, you have to know that you are a sinner.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And Jesus would say, and this is such like a hard truth for us to believe, because I think a lot of us think, I'm not that bad of a person.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Like, I feel like I'm pretty good.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 But I would say there's no one who's ever lived who is good.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 No one listening to my voice right now who is good by God's definition.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 No one tuning in at any locations, no one in this room, not your grandma, not anybody who's ever lived, he would say.

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And that's honestly like, that's hard for me to believe.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And I think it's because like my standard of goodness is kind of relative.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Like I think that I'm good or bad or not that bad just kind of based on the fact that I bump into people and I'm like, I feel like I'm a good person, try to be nice, pay my taxes.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You know, I would give somebody money if they were looking to eat and all of the ways that I find myself good, oftentimes are kind of in comparison of people around me.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And so I look at like the extremes and I'm like, oh, that's a really bad dude.

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 I am not, that's a bad apple right there.

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Or I look at people who are really good and though I wouldn't put myself there with the epitome of the kindest life or kindest person ever, I'm like, I certainly wouldn't put myself at the most evil person life.

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So I bet I'm close to whatever the standard of good is.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 The problem with even that thinking that a lot of us have is it really breaks down because no one even knows what it means to be good.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Like to embrace the idea that, hey, there are good people and bad people in the world would be to embrace not just something the Bible says is wrong, would be to embrace something that none of us would even agree on what is good.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Like what, what is the standard of the definition of good?

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 If you do this amount of good things, you're a good person.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Like, like on the scale and kind of our life or kind of in our mind, most of us would begin to think through on the spectrum of humanity.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 There's a scale.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And at some point in terms of behavior.

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 If you cross over on this side of the line of the number of good things that you do in life and the ways that you live your life, you're probably good person.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 If you, if you don't and you live really terribly and you hurt other people, you murder people, then you'd be a bad person.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 None of us would agree even where to put the line of where, hey, everything past this side would be good.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Everything over here would be bad.

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Like, let's say if this is the spectrum of human behavior and this person over here is good.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 When I think about the epitome of like good living or good person, I would say, man, at the top of the list other than Jesus, I would put mother Teresa.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 There you go, mother looking good.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And she's over there in Calcutta serving lepers.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 She gives up her whole life.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And she's like, dude, I'm gonna lay it on the line.

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 I'm gonna go serve people.

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I'm giving everything that I have to you.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 God, I'm gonna be single for the sake of the gospel.

235
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I'm gonna do everything I can to serve the least of these.

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Even if it means me contracting leprosy, she gave up her entire life to serving.

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 So I'd be like, dude, that that would be the epitome other than Jesus of a really good life.

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 There may be some other examples that you would insert.

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So fill in the blank, whoever you would put over here.

240
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 This is kind of the height of it.

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And then over here, we'd have like the universal symbol of what it means to be evil, which I think all of us would agree on.

242
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 No, that's wrong.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Sorry about that.

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We put this like right here, maybe.

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And I'm just messing.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Good grief.

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 It's going to get an email.

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I'm like, that's really not appropriate.

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 OK.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Over here, we would have something like Hitler.

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Where we go like, OK, so over here, we've got Mother Teresa, the best life you could probably live.

252
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And then over here, Hitler, not a great guy.

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And so wherever the line would be of everyone over here is a good person.

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And then everyone closer to Hitler, all of us would disagree.

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Like some of you may be like, yeah, most people are pretty good, except for kind of over here, definitely not good people.

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But I think for the most part, generally, you'll hear people say things like that.

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 That I just think everyone has a good heart.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Or I think most people in general are good.

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Maybe you're on the other side, and you'd be like, no, I think most people are not good.

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 You've seen the world out there?

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And you'd be like, no, it's definitely only like the top 10%, kind of like the college rule.

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 That is the people who are good in life.

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And so we wouldn't even agree on the same standard.

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Maybe you'd go like, man, now it's 50%.

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 You've got to just divide the line and do 50% more things.

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Maybe it's like 70, kind of the college or the school grading system.

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 That's where it all came from.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 You've got to do 70% good things in order to be good.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 But the point being, none of us would all land on the same place in terms of the scale of what even good is.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 But what is clear in the Bible is the standard of where the line is for what's good and not falls way past Mother Teresa.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It would be as though the rope went way over there for all of eternity.

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 That Mother Teresa, as good as she was as a person, falls way short of God's standard of what is good.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And Jesus is starting this conversation by going like, hey, before you go into eternal life, you know that the goal is not a good life, right?

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Or the goal is not you just being good.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 That would be an impossible goal.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 No one is good but God.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 So if you think like the whole message of God is just here to like, hey, I'm just trying to make good people good or you've got a lie.

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 You're setting out for a goal that you'll never be able to reach because God's standard and definition of goodness is way different than yours.

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Like God's definition of goodness.

280
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Here's I think further why it's hard for us.

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 The standard of goodness, according to the Bible, that God has is completely good.

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Like on earth, for me, it's kind of like, yeah, if it's mostly good, if they're mostly a good person, then they're a good person.

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The Bible says something crazy.

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 It's like, hey, if there's any part of them that's not good, they're not good.

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 They're a bad person.

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 It's like there's certain things in life where we've all seen, hey, if there's any part that's not good, then the entire thing is ruined.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 What do I mean by that?

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Like for example, if you've traveled recently and you went on vacation for a week.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 You come home, go to the fridge.

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 What do you do?

291
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You begin to check food and look at stuff and you're like, is this good?

292
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You're checking expiration date.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You pull out the milk.

294
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 All of a sudden you see that there's like curdled parts of the milk.

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 What would you not do?

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 You wouldn't take that out and be like, look, the curdles are just on the top.

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Let's strain this out.

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Everything else is fine in here.

299
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Unless you're psychotic, because that's not what normal, because you are rational enough to know, hey, if any part of this is not good, the whole thing's not good.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And the Bible is crazy.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It is.

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 That is God's standard for heaven.

303
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That is God's standard in terms of goodness, that there is no person who has ever lived that is good, that is as good as God, that has lived in such a way that

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 they could even be classified as good and certainly not classified as good enough for heaven.

305
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And the goal of the Christian life is not to just be good.

306
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 It is so much more than that.

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And so Jesus engages in a conversation with the guy saying, hey, why do you call me good?

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 There's nobody who's ever been good but God.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Maybe you're thinking, isn't the Bible stories of good people and good principles?

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Like, isn't that kind of what the Bible is?

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Like a bunch of stories of people who try their best to kind of live a good life and some good guys in there and follow their example.

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 No.

313
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 The Bible is a story or story after story of a bunch of bad guys and one good guy.

314
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And the bad guys are so bad that they kill the one good guy.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 That's Jesus.

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And if you don't think if you think I'm kidding, no.

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Every single story you read person after person is someone who is totally broken, messed up.

318
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 And God, despite all of that, uses them.

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 I mean, think about it.

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Abraham, father of faith.

321
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Remember Abraham?

322
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Father Abraham, many sons.

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Abe.

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Abraham pimps out his wife Sarah twice.

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I think we can all agree that's at least two times too many.

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 That's Abraham.

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 That's the guy that God's like, you, hey, I'm picking you.

328
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Father of many nations.

329
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Everyone is going to be descended from you.

330
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 That's the one that God chooses.

331
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 David.

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Remember King David?

333
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Killed Goliath, went out there, slingshot, took him down.

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 David sleeps with one of his best friend's wife and then kills him to cover it up.

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Think about that.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 That's the guy.

337
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 The Bible says, man, after God's own heart, that's what that guy is.

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I'm not even sure we'd let him serve at the porch.

339
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 I mean, it's like he's a little crazy.

340
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 For real.

341
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Moses.

342
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Moses had an anger problem to the point where he killed another guy with his bare hands.

343
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 The apostle Paul, the apostle Paul, the guy.

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Spent half of his life trying to stomp out Christianity, oversaw people losing their lives.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 That's the guy that Jesus decided, you know what?

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 We're going to let him write half of the New Testament.

347
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The Bible is not story after story of good people and good principles.

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It is a story about a bunch of bad, broken people and one good guy named Christ or Jesus

349
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 who came into this world, who died for all of the bad different people.

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And the goal of the Christian life is not to just be good.

351
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And if you're ever going to step into experiencing everything God wants for you, you got to recognize that you in and of yourself are not a good person.

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Because that need of being a sinner sets you up to experience the solution of your Savior coming into your life.

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And with the end, if you can't get there, you're never going to see a need for a Savior.

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 But Jesus continues going in the conversation with the man and takes an interesting direction.

355
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Here's what he responds with in response to, hey, you know, there's nobody good with God.

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 You know the commandments. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery.

357
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Do not defraud. Honor your father and your mother.

358
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And he said to him, the guy responds, teacher, all of these I have kept from my youth.

359
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I'm not entirely confident this is right, but my guess is that's probably not true.

360
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And if I'm Jesus, I'm sitting there being like all of these really, huh?

361
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Always honored your parents, your father and your mother, never sped on the camel, never done anything.

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Hmm.

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 I would be like calling him out like, hey, I don't know if you know this, but I'm God.

364
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And I saw when you were 11 and 11 1/2 and 12 when you talked back to your mom and every day of your life.

365
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And but Jesus didn't do that at all. Here's what it says.

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I love this.

367
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Jesus looked at him and he loved him.

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And he said, one thing you lack.

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Go and sell everything that you have and give it to the poor.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And you will have treasure in heaven.

371
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And come follow me.

372
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Disheartened by the saying, the man went away very sorrowful.

373
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 He was sad because he had great possessions.

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 What is Jesus saying?

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 In Matthew's version of the story, Jesus said in response to the man saying, hey, look, I've done all the commandments, all of those five commandments.

376
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Interesting, there's only five of them.

377
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Come back to that in a second.

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And he mentions.

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But I've done all of them my entire life.

380
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 What else must I do?

381
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 It says, hey, if you want to be perfect, here's what you have to do.

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 It's interesting.

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Jesus says you still lack one thing.

384
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And then he tells him, like, at least four things to go do.

385
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Go sell, give, follow.

386
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 What's the one thing?

387
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 What are you saying here, Jesus?

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Jesus is telling man, hey, if you want to live by the standard of perfection and by the law and you want to get into heaven or have a relationship with God, according to the law, you got to be perfect.

389
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 You got to follow everything that God's word has ever said.

390
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And clearly you don't love your neighbor as yourself, which is a command, because you have all this money and there's a lot of poor people out there.

391
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So go sell everything that you have.

392
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Jesus wasn't against the man, and it wasn't even about money.

393
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Jesus loved this man, but he knew there was something that was holding him back from going all in with Jesus.

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And that was his money.

395
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Ultimately, what Jesus presses on is so relevant to our lives, because you know what disabled the guy from going and selling everything, from doing what God said to do or from doing what Jesus, who is God, in that moment said to do?

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 He didn't really believe Jesus was as good as he said.

397
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 He really didn't believe Jesus was either God or that God was good and that everything God ever asks of me to do is always good.

398
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 I can trust him.

399
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 It's better than my plan.

400
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So I can go sell everything that I have.

401
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And it's only going to be for my benefit.

402
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 I'm going to see it's only better than I could have even imagined.

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And not believing God was good kept him from going all in with God.

404
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 It was not believing fully.

405
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 He may have said, you know, God is good.

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Praise God.

407
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 But there were areas of his life that didn't believe God's ways are always good.

408
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 God's commands, God's will for your life is always good.

409
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And it kept him from going all in with God.

410
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And I think that truth is so relevant to us today because I think I know there's parts of my heart when it comes to God's commands in the Bible.

411
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 God's ways for my life.

412
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 There's parts of me that are like, I don't know that I really believe God is as good as he says he is.

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Like, I think I would give more.

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 If I really believe that, hey, everything that I ever give, like I'm gonna have treasure and everything that I've ever given, I'll never regret anything that I sacrifice for God's kingdom.

415
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 I think I would give more if I fully and totally believe God is as good as he says.

416
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 So everything he tells me to do is good.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I think I'd probably worry less.

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I think I care a lot less what other people think.

419
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And there's parts of my life and parts of your life that may not believe that God is as good.

420
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 His ways are as good as he says that they are.

421
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I wrote my notes that anytime I resist the will of God.

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I resist what God's word in the Bible says, what his commands say.

423
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 It reflects the fact that I don't believe God is as good as God says he is.

424
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Maybe even as I say he is.

425
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Because I think a lot of us in the room would be like, look, dude, God is great.

426
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 God is good.

427
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 He's Lord over everything.

428
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 He's so good.

429
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But when it comes to you breaking up with your girlfriend, who you know, man, is not who God has for you.

430
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 When it comes to you not living together before marriage, you're like, I can't do that.

431
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I mean, that's just crazy.

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That's just not wise.

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I mean, it's not what people do today.

434
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 You don't believe God is as good as he says.

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He says, keep the marriage bed undefiled.

436
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 You don't believe that's actually good.

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 If you're doing it, you're like, hey, begrudgingly, I guess I'll do it.

438
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 I don't really like to.

439
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And I guess I have to go to heaven.

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 That's not believing that God and everything that he says in the Bible and every command that he gives you is really good.

441
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 It's for your good.

442
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It's going to lead to life.

443
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Like I can trust him.

444
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I can do it.

445
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 If you have no regrets in life, take it to the bank.

446
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And sadly, I think if most of us were honest, there's parts of us that it's like, I just don't know that I actually believe doing what God says every time is really that good.

447
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Everything God commands is good.

448
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And this was a man who he didn't believe that following Jesus's command would actually be something that for the rest of his days, he would go, man, I never regret that decision.

449
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 What's interesting is Jesus even says in a second, like four verses later, hey, this is not about money.

450
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 This is about do you trust me?

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Are you all in with me?

452
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Do you surrender?

453
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Do you believe that I'm as good as I say I am?

454
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Do you believe that I'm better than anything the world could offer?

455
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Do you believe that I'm better than your possessions?

456
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 That's what this whole thing was about.

457
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 It wasn't about money.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 How do I know that?

459
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Because in verse 28, think about these sentences.

460
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Verse 28, it says this.

461
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Peter said, after this whole thing goes down, God, we left everything to follow you.

462
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And Jesus said, truly I say to you, there's no one who's left a house or brothers or mother or father, children or lands for my sake and for the gospel, who will not receive a hundredfold in this life.

463
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the age to come eternal life, but many who are first will be last.

464
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 In other words, people read this text and like, you see, Jesus is against you having stuff.

465
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 That's insane.

466
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Jesus just said anyone who goes all in with his kingdom is going to have more stuff than ever before.

467
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 For all of eternity, they're going to have a hundred times as much stuff.

468
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Jesus isn't against your stuff.

469
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And people will be like, hey, if you really want to be spiritual, you got to give everything away and pretend like you like it.

470
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And that is not what the Bible teaches.

471
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And that's not the point he's trying to make.

472
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 He's saying, do you believe me?

473
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I'm as good as I say I am.

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Who do you think that I am?

475
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Do you trust me?

476
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Are you going all in?

477
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Are you just trying to control the circumstances and kind of get what you want?

478
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Rich, young ruler out of life.

479
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 For you, maybe it's not money.

480
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Maybe you wouldn't be like, hey, you don't.

481
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You're like, I'll do.

482
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I'll give it all away.

483
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 I've got like $4.

484
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I'm all in.

485
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I surrender it.

486
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 But to you, and maybe you say, hey, are you willing to save sex for marriage?

487
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Are you willing to stop partying on the weekend?

488
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Are you willing to change the friend group that you're running with that you know they're pulling you down?

489
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Are you willing to give up alcohol?

490
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Are you willing to surrender the areas of your life that you know you're experiencing less than God's best?

491
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Areas where you're living just outside of what God says in his words, how to live and where life is found.

492
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 And there's part of us, if you're resisting right now and you're like, no, I don't know that I could do that.

493
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Are you willing to give up your reputation and your community group by bringing forward and confessing the sin that you've been hiding?

494
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Like you're like, I'm over it.

495
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I don't care what they think about me.

496
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I want to be free and I want to honor God.

497
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Are you willing to do that?

498
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And if not, it's because there's an area of your heart that doesn't believe God is as good as he says that he is, and you can trust him, and you can do what he says, and it always leads to your good.

499
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Because that's what the Bible says.

500
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Some of us, sadly, man, we do what the rich, unruly did, which is like we want to have this relationship with God that's like friends with benefits.

501
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Like, you know what friends with benefits is?

502
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It's like whenever you have a relationship with somebody and you're like, hey, I'm for sure you're in the friend zone, but you're kind of attractive enough for us to have casual sex every now and then.

503
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 We're definitely not getting married.

504
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And this is not that serious.

505
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 And I kind of keep my options open still.

506
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And I get to fool around whenever I want to and kind of hook up and then also still date.

507
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 It's telling that person that, hey, I like what I can get from you, but I'm not ready to really commit to you and I want to explore because I think there's probably a better option out there.

508
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And a lot of people think that way and live that way with God.

509
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Where it's like, hey, I want to go to heaven when I die.

510
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I want to have everything that I want.

511
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 I want to be able to have sex in as many windmills as I can possible, and I want to do whatever I want to.

512
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 But I'm not really ready to go all in.

513
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 But, hey, I want to spend this season building my career.

514
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And I know God is like, you're supposed to be involved in a church.

515
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And I'm like, that's a little intense.

516
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 I'll do that at some point.

517
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I'm going to settle down and get more serious about my faith.

518
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 But I'm not ready to right now.

519
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But I still want to go to heaven when I die.

520
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Still love the good vibes that I get whenever I go and hear the service.

521
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And, yeah, it's good for me.

522
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Here we go.

523
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 But I'm not ready to go all in.

524
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And it's like a weird friends with benefits thing where Jesus is saying, hey, just like in that scenario, the reason you don't go all in with her is because you're like, I think there may be something better.

525
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 The same thing is being said about Jesus where it's like rich young ruler looks at son of God in the face.

526
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 And he says, oh, dude, I think I might have something better.

527
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 That's insane.

528
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 When I read that story, I'm like, dude, what did you even have?

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Like you got a lot of possessions?

530
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Like a camel?

531
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 What do you got in the first century?

532
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 I got a lot of cool stuff here, Jesus.

533
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 I don't know if I can give up this basket here.

534
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And this is my camel and it got a blanket.

535
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And I don't think so.

536
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 I mean, it's like what?

537
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It's not like you have like an iPhone.

538
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And he's like, all right, well, Jesus, I don't know.

539
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 What can you do that an iPhone can do?

540
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 It's not like he had cool stuff but he's still going.

541
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It's crazy.

542
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And from this vantage point, you're going, dude, you just turned down the son of God.

543
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 You were afraid of missing out.

544
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And look at what you missed out on.

545
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Like think about that.

546
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 That's crazy.

547
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 This dude would have been the 13th disciple.

548
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 He's the guy who told Jesus no.

549
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 There's a very small list of people that said no to Jesus.

550
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 There's a lot of people who wanted to follow Jesus that Jesus said no to.

551
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Slow your ride.

552
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 To this guy he says, follow me.

553
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And the guy says no.

554
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 We would have been naming our children after him.

555
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 It would have been Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Rory.

556
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Rory is over here.

557
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Think about that.

558
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And he looked at the son of God in the face and said, no, I really like my stuff.

559
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 I wonder how much that's still happening today.

560
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 We look at God in the face and as silly as that looks, we're like, really?

561
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 A camel?

562
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Ten camels?

563
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 A house?

564
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 That's why you turned him down?

565
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 It's got to look just as silly.

566
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Eternity's vantage point where you're like, really?

567
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 He asked you to save and when it came to dating, to date in a specific way and to preserve and pursue purity,

568
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 and you were like, no, I don't really care about that.

569
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 You thought your way would be better than God's?

570
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 You didn't think that you were going to miss out on all that comes with the good life that God wants for you by following his ways?

571
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Really?

572
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 You want to live for you in this life and spend all of your time just focused on you?

573
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 And he said anything you do in this life and in this world will be for all of eternity echoed?

574
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You want to spend all of that on you?

575
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 It's got to look just as crazy.

576
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And the reason why it happens, I know in my life, is because there's areas of my heart that do not believe God is as good as he says he is.

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 His ways are as good as he says.

578
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And Jesus looks at the man and he pushes his thumb on that.

579
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 You don't think you could trust me?

580
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And he loved him.

581
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 This wasn't about his stuff.

582
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 This was about a relationship.

583
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Finally, it says Jesus looked around as the man goes away sad, and he says, how difficult is it -- I put this back up so we're not all looking at the little mustache this whole time.

584
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Just realize that.

585
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Sleep well.

586
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 It says this.

587
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 How difficult is it for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God?

588
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 The disciples were amazed at his words.

589
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Jesus said to them, again, children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God.

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.

591
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And they were exceedingly astonished.

592
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And they said to him, then who can be saved?

593
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Jesus looked at them and said, with man, it's impossible.

594
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 But all things are possible for God.

595
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 The disciples are astonished because in this day and this time, the idea of a wealthy person was wealthy because God was blessing him.

596
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And Jesus just says, that's not what's going on.

597
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 In other words, people have this wrong idea that, hey, if you're really wealthy, it's because you're #blessed and God has blessed your life and that's why you're rich.

598
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 So you're going to have a closer relationship with God.

599
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And Jesus says, that's not true at all.

600
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 The point, again, is not about rich people.

601
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You can be rich and go to hell.

602
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 You can be poor and go to hell.

603
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 You can be rich and go to heaven and be poor and go to heaven.

604
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 The point of the story is that dependence, the ability of being able to say, man, I'm not good.

605
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 I need a savior.

606
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Keeping the commandments will never save me.

607
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Becoming a person who sees their desperate need for God to bridge the gap that their behavior can't do.

608
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Like, I can't be a good enough person.

609
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 It's like, that becomes more and more difficult to see your need for God the more money that you have.

610
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 That's all that he's saying.

611
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 But if you read the last verse of this whole section, he says, it's impossible for anyone to be saved.

612
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 The man can never save himself.

613
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 That only God saves.

614
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 That God alone saves every single time.

615
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 If you're in church for the first time in a while, I want you to listen to me.

616
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Keeping sacraments will not get you to heaven.

617
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Getting baptized will not save you.

618
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Your church attendance will not save you.

619
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Reading your Bible will not save you.

620
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Doing anything that involves you will not save you.

621
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Christianity is not what you achieve.

622
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It is who you receive in Jesus.

623
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 That's the message of Christianity.

624
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 You don't have to accept that.

625
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Maybe you're like, huh, that's at least fascinating.

626
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 You need to at least walk out of here if you don't have a Christian faith, knowing that's what the Bible teaches.

627
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 It doesn't teach, hey, do a bunch of good things and good people, and this is what God is here for.

628
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Good, good, good.

629
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 It teaches that there's no one who can do good but God.

630
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And he came and he died for bad people like you and bad people like me.

631
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 God alone is the one who saves.

632
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 All that we do is we receive.

633
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 We accept the free gift that God has offered us.

634
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 What is the free gift?

635
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Jesus.

636
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 And he gave his life.

637
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 That's what he was doing on the cross.

638
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 He died for you.

639
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 The message of Christianity is not good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.

640
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 It's forgiving people.

641
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And there's only one way to be forgiven.

642
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Forgiveness, what does it do?

643
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 It restores a relationship.

644
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Like if I hurt you and we're upset with one another,

645
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 and I come and I ask for forgiveness,

646
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 it allows the relationship to heal.

647
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Jesus,

648
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 in dying for you,

649
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 extended the invitation

650
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 that, "Hey, I've paid for everything wrong you did."

651
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 It's forgiving.

652
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Forgiveness is yours,

653
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 but you have to accept it.

654
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 How do I accept it?

655
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Stop trusting in how good of a person you are.

656
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Stop believing that

657
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 all these I've kept from my youth,

658
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 and that's why I should get in.

659
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Honestly, the flip side is probably more relevant today.

660
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 I'd less hear people being like,

661
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 "Look, I've kept all the commandments from my youth."

662
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And more like,

663
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 "I've just been a really bad person."

664
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And just like this guy's off

665
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 'cause he's like, "Doing good gets me in."

666
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 This guy is off 'cause he thinks,

667
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 "Doing bad keeps me out."

668
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And the Bible doesn't teach any of that.

669
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 It teaches trusting in Jesus

670
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 is what grants access to eternal life.

671
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And the rich person in this story,

672
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 the reason why it is so difficult

673
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 is because he was unable to see his need

674
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 for a savior.

675
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 He was unable to see his need

676
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 for a savior.

677
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 And depending on himself,

678
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 depending on the good things that he had done.

679
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Even right before this verse,

680
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 or even right before this section,

681
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 you know what it says?

682
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 The verse is right before, I've never noticed this before.

683
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Like literally in Mark chapter 10,

684
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 three verses before this story we're reading,

685
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 it says this, "And they were bringing children

686
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 to Jesus, that he might touch them,

687
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 and the disciples rebuked them."

688
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 So Jesus is sitting there,

689
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 the rich young ruler is about to run up,

690
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 he's sitting there hanging out,

691
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 and people are like, "Oh, it's Jesus, bring our kids over there,

692
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 maybe he can bless them."

693
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And the disciples are like, "What do you think, is this Disney World?

694
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Get these kids out of here." And Jesus looks at them,

695
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 and says, "He saw it and was indignant

696
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 at the disciples," or upset.

697
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 He said, "Let the children

698
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 come to me,

699
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 or little ones come to me."

700
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 He's talking about little children.

701
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 "And do not hinder them,

702
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 for to such

703
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 belongs the kingdom of God.

704
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Truly I say to you,

705
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 whoever does not receive the kingdom of God

706
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 like a child, shall not enter it."

707
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 And he took them in his arms and he blessed them, laying his hands on them.

708
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 What is he saying?

709
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 In Jesus' day, just like in our day,

710
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 children

711
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 were totally dependent on their parents.

712
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Like, children didn't bring

713
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 anything to the table, they didn't provide for themselves,

714
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 they often didn't change their clothes,

715
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 depending on their age, like, they literally bring

716
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 nothing to the table. Like, I've got

717
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 two kids, I have a one-year-old daughter, she brings

718
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 nothing to the table but need.

719
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 I mean, nothing.

720
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 She brings, hey, she can't feed herself,

721
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 she can't walk, she can't change

722
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 her diaper, she literally brings

723
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 nothing but noise into our home.

724
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 That's her contribution.

725
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 She's totally dependent.

726
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Before going into the story of the rich and ruler, Jesus said,

727
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 "You know how you enter the kingdom of God?

728
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Totally dependent.

729
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 You gotta see yourself as

730
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 you bring nothing to the table but need."

731
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 As easy as that sounds,

732
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 for many of us, it's the hardest thing we can do.

733
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 'Cause you still think that, man,

734
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 your need keeps you out of heaven.

735
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 Your failure.

736
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 You've brought a lie.

737
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Jesus, in another place,

738
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 would say,

739
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 "You have to exceed

740
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 the righteousness of the Pharisees

741
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 and scribes in order

742
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 to enter heaven." In Matthew chapter 5,

743
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 verse 20, it says this, "For I tell you,

744
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 unless your righteousness," that's your behavior,

745
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 "unless your goodness exceeds

746
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,

747
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 you will not enter the kingdom of heaven." When his audience

748
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 heard that, they would have gasped. Because the teachers of the law

749
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and the Pharisees, his dudes were like, "They're professional

750
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Christians. This is what we do." They memorized

751
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 the Old Testament. Most of them haven't

752
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 read the Old Testament. They fasted

753
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 all the time, like they gave their whole life, God, you've got all of it.

754
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And Jesus, in the crowd, he looks at these guys, he said,

755
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 "Unless you're a lot better than

756
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 these guys, you're not getting into heaven.

757
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Unless the righteousness you have

758
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 is better than them." This would be like me

759
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 saying to you, "Hey,

760
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 guys, in order to get into heaven, you've got to be fast."

761
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 You might go,

762
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 "How fast?" I say,

763
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 "You've got to be faster than Usain Bolt."

764
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 You would go,

765
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 "That's impossible." You mean the guy

766
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 who literally holds the world record

767
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 for fastest human of all time?

768
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 That guy?

769
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Yeah, that guy.

770
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Well, if he's not good enough,

771
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 then no one is good enough.

772
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Jesus would say,

773
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 "Exactly.

774
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 That's the point.

775
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 If you try to act and behave your way,

776
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 you're never going to get there."

777
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 The message of you obeying the law, and he

778
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 looks into the eyes of this man saying, "Hey, you obeying

779
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 the law was never to be the way that you could have

780
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 a road to God. In the Old Testament,

781
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 it was not given for that purpose, and you need to know

782
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 this."

783
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Do you know what the very first thing that is given after the Ten

784
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Commandments, where I said earlier, Jesus, he goes

785
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 through and he says off five of the Ten Commandments?

786
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 Do you know in the Old Testament, Exodus chapter 20,

787
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 God gives the Ten Commands? You've probably

788
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 heard the Ten Commandments before, and he's sitting there and he tells

789
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 us that God comes to Moses, and he's like, "I write these

790
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 things down, and let my people go." And he gets

791
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 the tablets, and he's writing them out there, and he's like, "These are

792
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 awesome, dude. These are original, and

793
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 this is great. Don't commit adultery. You got it. Don't kill."

794
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Goes through all Ten Commandments, Moses goes down the mountain,

795
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 he's got the Ten Commands with the guy. Do you know what the next

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 thing that happens is?

797
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 I mean, the very next thing

798
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 that God says, "Here's what

799
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 I want you to do next.

800
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Build an altar.

801
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Get the people together

802
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 and build an altar. I know I just gave you

803
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 the Ten Commandments, and nobody's even tried

804
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 to follow them yet. You're never gonna be

805
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 able to, so build an altar and

806
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 sacrifice to me on it." Think about

807
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 that. Before anything

808
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 has ever taken place, or before

809
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 any laws have even really been broken,

810
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 God, he's like, "Here's the law, and I know you're not

811
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 gonna follow them, and so I need you to set up an

812
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 altar to make sacrifices." It is the

813
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 very next thing. The purpose of the law was never

814
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 to give you some path that you can keep

815
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 these things, you can have a relationship with God. He knew that

816
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 you couldn't. That's why the next

817
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 thing he says, "Build an altar,

818
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 and on it you're gonna sacrifice

819
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 to me for all the ways that you failed to live up to these

820
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Ten before anyone had even broken

821
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 one yet."

822
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 The engraving on the

823
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 stone or ink, whatever they wrote with,

824
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 hadn't even dried, and God said, "Build an altar."

825
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Because the point

826
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 was never that these things could earn your

827
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 relationship with God.

828
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 He knew that you were gonna fail. He knew that I was

829
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 gonna fail, and he said, "Every time that you

830
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 fail, I want you to sacrifice to me so that you

831
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 associate sin and

832
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 sacrifice together, 'cause it's gonna point

833
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 ultimately to the great sacrifice that's coming,

834
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 which is my son."

835
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 It was never meant, the Old Testament

836
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 was never some book that, "Hey, if you do these things,

837
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 then you can have a relationship with God," or, "Keep

838
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 these rules,

839
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 or else you gotta reconcile."

840
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 That's insane. Here's the law,

841
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 and then build an altar, 'cause no one can keep it.

842
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 That's what God says.

843
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And Jesus looks at this

844
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 man who's bought the lie that

845
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 if I keep everything,

846
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 if I keep the commandments,

847
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 then I can have a

848
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 relationship with God, and he says, "You missed it."

849
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 As I said, the gospel says it's not about something you achieve, or eternal life is not something you achieve, it's something you receive, because it is not what you do. The man asks the wrong question.

850
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 What must I do to inherit eternal life?

851
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 And the question over and over is,

852
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 "Who must I believe in?

853
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 What must I

854
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 receive

855
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 in order to inherit eternal life?"

856
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 Because the gospel's not about what you do, it's about

857
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 who you are in relationship with,

858
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 or who you know. Not long

859
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 ago, I was invited to go to,

860
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 when Cowboy Stadium here in Dallas was

861
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 shortly after it was built, Jerry Jones,

862
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 or the Jerry World got built,

863
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 and this massive stadium, and I

864
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 had some friends that had a

865
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 suite, like they owned a suite inside

866
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 of it, and so invited, got a chance

867
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 to go with their family. And it wasn't

868
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 just the up-high suites,

869
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 it was like suites I didn't even know existed.

870
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 Suites that are on the ground floor, where you

871
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 step out of the stadium, or

872
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 out of your suite, sorry, and you walk up onto

873
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 the field. And I'm going there, and we park in this

874
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 special parking garage, and it's like, "Dude, this

875
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 is, I didn't even know this existed."

876
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 And everywhere you look, there's just

877
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 like, "Dallas is who's who."

878
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 It's like, "These are not my people, and these

879
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 are a lot of shiny people in here."

880
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 And walking around, and just kind of like seeing

881
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 all of it, and it's just like crazy, mind-blowing stuff.

882
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 Like all the food that we ate inside of the suite

883
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 was just, you've never been to a place that's so nice?

884
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 And I'm like, "Do you guys do to-go boxes or anything?"

885
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 And it's like, just flaming on, and they're like,

886
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 "Sir, if we don't have something you like, just tell us,

887
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 we'll make any of it." And it's like, "I don't think

888
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 I'm ever leaving here." And it just was

889
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 one thing, out of the next, it was amazing.

890
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 And then at some point, we got to walk up

891
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 onto the field, and you're like, 10 feet away,

892
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 you're like, "Dude, there's Tony. There he is, Tony Romo.

893
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 He's throwing it around, and still not winning."

894
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 And it was just like this crazy, surreal

895
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 experience, sorry, Tony.

896
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And it just was this amazing deal.

897
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 And I remember thinking like, "Bro, this is crazy.

898
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 How did that...they've got to be thinking,

899
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 'Who is that guy? What is he doing in here?

900
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 There's some imposter amongst us.

901
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 We can tell, because he's not dressed like us.'"

902
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 And then realizing,

903
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 I have every right to be here.

904
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Not because I deserved it, not because I earned it,

905
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 not because I paid for it, but because I'm with their son.

906
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Because of who I'm with.

907
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 In the same way, that's what Christianity says.

908
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 The reason why you can have eternal life,

909
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 and you have access to the sweet of heaven,

910
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 is because you are with the son.

911
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 The son of God. Not their son in there.

912
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 And what you have been given access to is far greater

913
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 than any sweet that we could experience in this life.

914
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 And the only way that you can

915
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 have access to God,

916
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 have access to eternal life with him,

917
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 is because you're associated with the son.

918
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 The Bible says, "When you trust in Jesus,

919
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 you are placed in Christ."

920
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 That he no longer looks at you,

921
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 and he sees you.

922
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 He sees all of the righteousness of God.

923
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 That's what the Bible teaches, as it relates to you.

924
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 He doesn't see your sin.

925
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 Whatever you did today, if you're a Christian, you're in Christ.

926
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 You are the righteousness of God.

927
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Think about that.

928
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Because of what you do.

929
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Because of who you are with.

930
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 Who you are associated with.

931
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 Jesus, that's the message of Christianity.

932
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 Conclusion, there's no one who's good.

933
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 The goal is not to be good.

934
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 He came to make dead people alive.

935
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Resisting God's will reflects areas

936
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 where we just don't believe God is as good as he says.

937
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 And some of you need to hear and be reminded tonight,

938
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 or you need to hear for the first time,

939
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 you can't save yourself.

940
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 Only Jesus saves.

941
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 And if you're ever gonna have that eternal life,

942
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 it's gonna come by doing what this young man didn't do.

943
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Trusting in Jesus.

944
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 The irony of the whole story is

945
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 Jesus is like 32 years old.

946
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Sitting there and he's looking eyeball to eyeball with this guy.

947
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 It's probably about his age.

948
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Some really striking similarities, if you think about it.

949
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 They're both young.

950
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 So the young man was rich.

951
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 Is there anyone who's ever lived richer than Jesus?

952
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 No.

953
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 He's the richest there has ever been.

954
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 All things are his.

955
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 This man owned a house and a home and some stuff.

956
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 Jesus owned all of it, everything.

957
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 This young man was a ruler.

958
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 He had some authority and influence.

959
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 Jesus was also a ruler.

960
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 He ruled over not just some synagogue,

961
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 over all things.

962
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 But Jesus is the ultimate rich young ruler.

963
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 He's a greater, more true,

964
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 and he's a rich young ruler

965
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 that was willing to do what this young ruler was not.

966
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 Go to greater lengths out of the expression

967
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 of his love to sacrifice everything.

968
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 I'll lay down even my life.

969
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 That's what the Bible says.

970
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 That Christ became infinitely more poor,

971
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 was as rich as you could be,

972
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 and left the riches of heaven

973
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 to become poor

974
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 so that in him, you who are poor

975
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 might become rich.

976
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 And he's given himself,

977
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 despite the fact that it's to people

978
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 who hold on to things,

979
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 who hold on to relationships,

980
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 who hold on to their method of dating,

981
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 who hold on to anxiety, who hold on to all kinds of different things

982
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 that only hurt them.

983
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 That if they would just let go, they'll come a day

984
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 where they'll look back and say, "I can't even believe I was tempted

985
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 to hold on to that." And despite all of that,

986
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 he came and died.

987
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 He laid all of it aside

988
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 for you, for me,

989
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 for this young man

990
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 who never even trusted in him,

991
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 as far as we know.

992
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 He's the richest of all,

993
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 the ruler of all,

994
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 and the savior of all who will trust in him.

995
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 Let me pray.

996
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 Father, you are worthy of all,

997
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 all of our life,

998
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 our hearts, our self,

999
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 our stuff, our time,

1000
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 our years, and we

1001
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 confess we have divided

1002
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
 hearts, we have divided minds,

1003
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 we have chased after

1004
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 idols

1005
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 and sin, we've looked for

1006
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 security and

1007
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 money, we've looked for identity and

1008
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
 relationships, we have

1009
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 despaired over circumstances rather than

1010
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 trust you, and we are in desperate

1011
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 need of you winning more ground in our hearts,

1012
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 and so we ask you to do that,

1013
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 God. We invite you here,

1014
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 and we invite you to take more ground in our heart.

1015
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 God, start with me.

1016
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Would you

1017
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 be the

1018
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 ruler of

1019
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 our life, our stuff,

1020
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 ourselves? I pray for anyone who's never trusted

1021
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 in you, God. Tonight, you would do what only

1022
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 you could do, which is save,

1023
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 awaken them to the reality they have

1024
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 bite the lie just like this young man.

1025
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
 That they're just good enough,

1026
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 they just live enough consecutive days doing

1027
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 some good stuff that you'll love them.

1028
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 They can have certainty with you.

1029
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 Or they'll just go a long enough

1030
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 time without whatever

1031
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 sin they feel like has

1032
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 owned them, then you'll love them. You would

1033
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 break through that wall.

1034
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 We worship you now in song.

1035
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Amen.
