 [ Music ]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,400
 >> Well, good evening.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,320
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,180
 Hey, it is so good to be here.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,320
 My name is Timothy Atik and I am one of the teaching pastors here

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,340
 at Watermark Community Church.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,420
 And I always love getting to be at the porch.

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,980
 David and his team do such an incredible job.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,320
 So, just get to step in tonight is truly a joy.

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,560
 If you don't have a church that you call home, I want to invite you to come

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,460
 and join us on a Sunday morning.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,140
 We would love to have you join us.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,440
 I want to start tonight just by sharing with you a very unwise

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,820
 and unfortunate decision that I made several years ago.

15
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:15,240
 I attempted to drive from Austin to Dallas without my wife, but with my two kids who were 2

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,180
 and a half and 5 months old at the time.

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,360
 Very unfortunate decision.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,880
 You think that that's an easy task.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,840
 It's really not.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,300
 It's one of those things that you do and then you're like,

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,220
 "That was really unwise.

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,160
 I need a mentor."

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,840
 And so, here's how things played out.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,860
 I left Austin.

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,620
 I began to make my way up I-35 and for the first hour, I was crushing it as a dad,

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,020
 primarily because both boys were asleep.

27
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,860
 But an hour into the trip, they both woke up and I decided that it was time for lunch.

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,820
 So, I pulled off into the parking lot of the Chick-fil-A in Temple, Texas.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,960
 If you've been to that Chick-fil-A, you know what I'm talking about.

30
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,380
 And so, we pulled in and I parked and I just stopped and I thought about everything that needed

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,620
 to happen in order for me to get in and out with my two boys without dying.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,480
 And so, I felt like I had my game plan.

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,580
 I got out of the car and I began to make my way in and I just looked like a circus.

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,260
 I mean, I had diaper bags slung over my chest.

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,840
 I had my 5-month-old in his car seat in this hand.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,520
 I had my 2 and a half-year-old Noah in this hand.

37
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,700
 And you could like see the sympathy on the faces of the Chick-fil-A workers.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,880
 They were like, "My pleasure."

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,640
 Like, I know it's always their pleasure that night or that day.

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,820
 It was truly their pleasure.

41
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,760
 And so, I walked in, we got our food, we sat down, we began to enjoy our meal.

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,340
 Everything was going incredible until right there in the middle of that meal,

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,120
 my 5-month-old did something devastating in his diaper.

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,160
 I mean, just dropped a massive bomb.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,600
 It was the type of thing that it was like, "Okay, am I going to sit here and finish my

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,880
 number one with no pickles and a sweet tea with Chick-fil-A sauce or am I going to be a good dad

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,840
 and I'm actually going to go clean him up before I continue to enjoy my food?"

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,440
 And so, I just made the right decision that we need to clean this guy up.

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 And so, I got to gather up all of our stuff.

50
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,420
 I got both kids and we went into the bathroom of the Chick-fil-A in Temple, Texas.

51
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,760
 I pulled down the changing table, I put Andrew, my 5-month-old, on it and I told my 2-year-old,

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,360
 "Hey, you just stand right here."

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,800
 And it was like every man's bladder was synced up that day because they all converged on the

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 bathroom at the same time.

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,360
 So, we're in this tight space and I'm just ferociously wiping this kid down.

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,960
 And right there in the middle of trying to clean him up, he floods the changing table,

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,400
 a different number this time, and he floods it to the point where the changing table is

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,320
 completely out of order.

59
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,680
 And right as he floods the changing table, I use my last wet wipe.

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,960
 So, here I am, people, I am stranded in a moment with a changing table that is out of order

61
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:13,240
 and I am holding a bare-bottomed 5-month-old up in the air with nowhere to put him and nothing to

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,120
 clean him out with.

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,960
 And you might hear that and say, "Sounds like the worst-case scenario."

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,200
 It isn't.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,920
 The worst-case scenario is looking left just in time to see your 2-and-a-half-year-old playing

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,000
 with the urinal cake.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's the worst-case scenario.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,480
 So, let's talk about stress.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:42,880
 Yes, it does.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,200
 That's all you need to know.

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
 Let's pray and get out of here.

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,880
 No.

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,640
 I don't know if you've ever been stranded in a Chick-fil-A bathroom like that.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 Maybe you haven't.

75
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,440
 But I'll tell you what I felt in that moment holding that bare-bottomed baby.

76
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,240
 I felt stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,120
 And here's the deal.

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,440
 If you have more to do than time to do it, if finances feel tight, if you are single and you

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,040
 don't want to be, if you feel lonely heading into each weekend, if you've got some major

80
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,080
 project coming up at work, I wouldn't be surprised if you feel the same exact way.

81
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,520
 Stressed out, overwhelmed, and out of control.

82
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,200
 Just show of hands right now.

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,800
 Who can identify with that?

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,160
 Just be honest.

85
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,320
 Any...yeah.

86
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,480
 The majority of the people in the room in some way feel stressed out, overwhelmed,

87
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,800
 and out of control.

88
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,560
 And so tonight, I just want to encourage you, don't suppress your stress, address your

89
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
 stress.

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,760
 And you might be like, "I ain't suppressing my stress.

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,080
 Like, I am constantly stressed."

92
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,000
 Do you know what it looks like to suppress your stress?

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,800
 It's to let stress move into your life and just make itself at home to where the life you know is a

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,320
 life where there's always stress.

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,280
 Like, when I was in sixth grade, this freak accident happened and it necessitated me wearing

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,640
 an eye patch for a week because I got hit in the eye.

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,840
 But out of that experience, I developed what's known as an eye floater, which means at any

98
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:30,240
 given time, I still have it to today, at any given time, I see black dots right here.

99
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,800
 And for the first year I had it, I just thought a mosquito was constantly following me around.

100
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,400
 So I was like, and I could never get it.

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,120
 It was crazy.

102
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,080
 But then that one black dot got some friends.

103
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,560
 And so now I see a few black dots.

104
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,040
 The world that I know is a world with black dots.

105
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,280
 As far as I'm concerned, there are black dots in all of your worlds.

106
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,120
 That's just the world that I know.

107
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,280
 To suppress your stress is just to believe the world that you know, the life that you know,

108
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,640
 this is just the way it is, it's just stressful.

109
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,640
 That's what it means to suppress your stress.

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,320
 It's to believe that that is just the normal and natural reality of life.

111
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,160
 But as we open up the scriptures, which I believe is the word of God, here's what we're

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,900
 going to see tonight.

113
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,320
 Stress isn't inevitable, it's actually optional.

114
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,080
 Why?

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,600
 Because Jesus Christ is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.

116
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,080
 And so what I want to do is I want to look at a story in the Bible that might be familiar

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,320
 for some and for others.

118
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,520
 It might be the first time that you've ever heard it.

119
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,040
 But as we look at the story, what I want to do is I want to give you four key truths that

120
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,200
 you need to know if you want to address the stress in your life.

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,280
 And what you do with these four key truths will determine whether your life is chaotic

122
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
 or calm.

123
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,240
 It will determine if you go through this week feeling pressure or peace.

124
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,320
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me tonight to Mark chapter four.

125
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,360
 Mark chapter four is where we're going to be.

126
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,640
 And as you're turning there, I just want to acknowledge the fact that there are thousands

127
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,440
 of people in this room, which is amazing.

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,600
 And yet there are thousands of people all over this nation watching right now.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,440
 So as you're turning there, hello, Porch Live Midland, Texas, in Indy, in Scottsdale, in

130
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,600
 Austin, in Boise, I just love the fact that there are people all over this nation right

131
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,840
 now who are going to address their stress.

132
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,880
 Okay?

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,040
 Mark chapter four is where we're going to be.

134
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,120
 Okay, let me read you verses 35 through 38.

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,040
 It'll just kind of set the scene for us.

136
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,200
 It says this, "On that day when evening had come, he," that's Jesus, "said to them, 'Let

137
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,000
 us go across to the other side.'

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,560
 And other boats were with him.

140
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,880
 And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat

141
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 was already filling.

142
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,460
 But he," that's Jesus, "was in the stern, asleep on the cushion.

143
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:25,500
 And they woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?'"

144
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,200
 So all eyes on me, don't miss this.

145
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,800
 Okay, this is a story that is taking place on the Sea of Galilee, real place.

146
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,880
 Okay, the Sea of Galilee is situated at about 700 feet below sea level.

147
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,080
 It's surrounded by hills, and it is said that with the right mixture of temperature, pressure,

148
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,720
 wind, that sudden and violent storms can arise on the Sea of Galilee.

149
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,320
 This is a story about Jesus inviting his closest friends to get in a boat and to go to the

150
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
 other side of the Sea of Galilee.

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,640
 And it's interesting what happens because as Jesus and his friends make their way across

152
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,920
 the sea, they find themselves in a massive storm.

153
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:19,680
 And as water fills the boat, stress begins to fill their souls.

154
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,980
 And the reason that I find that interesting is because, I don't know if you know anything

155
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:31,120
 about Jesus' closest friends, but before several of his friends began to follow him, what was

156
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
 their occupation?

157
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
 Anyone know?

158
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
 Fishermen.

159
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,200
 So many of them were fishermen.

160
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 Do you know what that means?

161
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,320
 It means that the Sea of Galilee had been their office.

162
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,840
 These were boat guys.

163
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,280
 They were lake guys.

164
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,160
 Surely they had been in storms on the Sea of Galilee before.

165
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
 And yet what do we see?

166
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,560
 We see professional fishermen running to Jesus saying, "Do you not care that we are perishing?"

167
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:04,240
 These professional fishermen find themselves in, "I think we are going to die," type of

168
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
 storm.

169
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,680
 And as water fills the boat, stress fills their souls.

170
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,880
 Why?

171
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,760
 Because they begin to feel out of control.

172
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,880
 We don't see any of these professional fishermen saying, "Been here, done this.

173
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,320
 We know what these storms are like.

174
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,800
 We just need to do that.

175
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
 Do this.

176
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 You sit here.

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 I'll do this."

178
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 No.

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,040
 We see all of them saying, "I think that this is it.

180
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,480
 This is how the story of my life ends."

181
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,820
 And it shows us something very important.

182
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,840
 At the root of your stress, don't miss it.

183
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,820
 Here's the first key truth that you need to know if you want to address your stress.

184
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,920
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
 Do you realize that?

186
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,720
 Like if you were to just excavate down to the root of what is stressing you out, this

187
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
 is it.

188
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,040
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

189
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,480
 Like if you have more to do than time to do it, the reason that you're stressed is because

190
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,700
 you can't control the clock.

191
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,760
 You can't manufacture a 30-hour workday.

192
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,640
 If you're stressed out by the thought of being a bachelor to the rapture, some of you are

193
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,800
 like, "Sounds incredible."

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,000
 Others of you are like, "God, please no."

195
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,760
 But if the idea of being single for forever stresses you out, it's because you can't control

196
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,760
 when you're going to find somebody that it just makes sense to do life with for the rest

197
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,440
 of your life.

198
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
 If you're lonely and you just feel that stress of like, "What am I going to do this weekend?

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,040
 Is it going to be another weekend of me sitting here by myself?"

200
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,840
 If finances are tight, inflation is real right now, and yet maybe your salary isn't changing

201
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,520
 with it, and that is stressful.

202
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,760
 You're looking at your debt, you're looking at living in Dallas, and you're like, "Those

203
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,560
 two things don't work well together."

204
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,560
 It's stressing you out.

205
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
 Why?

206
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,720
 Because you feel out of control.

207
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,840
 You can't change how much money is coming in at the frequency it's coming in.

208
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,120
 At the root of your stress is a lack of control.

209
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,620
 So just do a deep dive into your own life.

210
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,880
 What is at the root of your stress?

211
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,520
 What is the thing that you cannot control?

212
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,160
 You're going to love the second key truth.

213
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,860
 Here it is.

214
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,920
 God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.

215
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,120
 No one's saying amen to that.

216
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,320
 But that's a reality.

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,440
 Like God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.

218
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,280
 Whose idea was it to go across to the other side of the Sea of Galilee?

219
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,080
 It was Jesus' idea.

220
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,840
 We know that Jesus is God, which means he knows all things.

221
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,480
 He knew that an "I think we are going to die" type of storm was going to come, and yet he

222
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,280
 suggested that they go across the sea at the exact time that there would be a storm.

223
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,480
 And then if you were to take this book and you were to just read the stories, you know

224
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
 what you would just see?

225
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,880
 You would see story after story of God putting his people in situations that they cannot

226
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 control.

227
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,960
 Like Moses busts two million plus people out of slavery to Egypt and begins to take

228
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,560
 them on the largest road trip in history.

229
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,160
 And yet where did they find themselves?

230
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
 At a dead end.

231
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,160
 At a dead end with the Egyptian army in pursuit.

232
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,280
 Daniel was thrown into a den of lions.

233
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,880
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace.

234
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,200
 Zechariah and Elizabeth were old, wrinkly, and barren.

235
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,760
 It's just story after story of God putting his people into situations that they cannot

236
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 control.

237
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,240
 And I think it just begs the question, if God truly loved us, why would he do that?

238
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,400
 And I promise you I'll answer that question before I'm done.

239
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,040
 But the reason that we struggle with the fact that God will lead us into situations that

240
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:11,560
 we cannot control is because the majority of us are control freaks.

241
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
 We're control freaks.

242
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,560
 Like some of you are budding control freaks and some of you are in full bloom and you

243
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
 know who you are.

244
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,720
 We need to have every aspect of our lives under control.

245
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,900
 We need to have our bank account under control.

246
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,200
 We need to have our job title under control.

247
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,680
 We need to have our future plans under control.

248
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
 We need to have our relationship status under control.

249
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,260
 We need to have the number on the scale under control.

250
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,840
 We need to have the reflection in the mirror under control.

251
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,180
 We need to have our weekend plans under, we need every single aspect of our lives under

252
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,260
 control.

253
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,880
 And if that's you, if you need to be in control of every aspect of your life, let me just

254
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,140
 lovingly tell you what your life will perpetually feel like.

255
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,080
 It will constantly feel like trying to carry a big pile of laundry.

256
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
 What do I mean by that?

257
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:13,920
 Well, for the people in here who do their own laundry, hopefully that's everyone.

258
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
 What do you do?

259
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,240
 Okay, you stuff the washing machine with everything that you can get into it, sometimes too much

260
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,680
 stuff but then you take that stuff and you put it in the dryer and after the dryer's

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
 run its cycle, what do you do?

262
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,480
 You open the door.

263
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,620
 And you think to yourself, like, I'm going to get this all in one load.

264
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,120
 Like we're busy people.

265
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,840
 We don't have time to make multiple trips from the dryer to the couch or from the dryer

266
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
 to our bedroom.

267
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
 And so what do we do?

268
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,420
 We get in there and we scrape the inside of the dryer and it's a feeling deal.

269
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,740
 You just got to wait till you feel it.

270
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,940
 And when you just sense that you have every article of clothing in your grasp, that's

271
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,040
 when you begin to make the walk, the walk to the couch or to the bed.

272
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:08,100
 But as you're walking, you get this deep sense inside of you to look back.

273
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,340
 And what do you see?

274
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,420
 Man down.

275
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,820
 Sock down.

276
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,340
 Now, this is where we display our brilliance, people.

277
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:27,340
 Because instead of going and dropping off the pile and coming back, no, we developed

278
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,100
 this very noble and heroic mantra of no sock left behind.

279
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:40,540
 And so we back up with the entire pile and we try and balance the entire pile of laundry

280
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,740
 in one hand as if two hands was working out for us.

281
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,660
 We free up an entire hand to grab the sock.

282
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,940
 And when we have the sock in our grasp, just when we think we have it all together, what

283
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,660
 do you see?

284
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,860
 Whitey tighties down and shame on you for never switching to boxers, but this will be,

285
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,700
 this will just be your life.

286
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,300
 You will want control and you just won't have it.

287
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,020
 Like just when you think life is good, you know what?

288
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,020
 Financial sock down.

289
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,100
 And just when finances begin to come together, you know what?

290
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,900
 Relationship stock underwear, or those are two different things.

291
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,300
 Relationship underwear down.

292
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,780
 This is just your reality.

293
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,740
 God will intentionally lead you into situations that you cannot control.

294
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,000
 It leads me to the third key truth that you need to know if you want to address your stress.

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,180
 You don't have to be in control because Jesus already is.

296
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
 That's it.

297
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:51,020
 You don't have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.

298
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
 Look back at the text.

299
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,540
 Look at what it says in verses 39 through 41.

300
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,380
 It says this, "And he," that's Jesus, "he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the

301
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,460
 sea, 'Peace, be still.'

302
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,860
 And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.

303
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,780
 And he said to them, 'Why are you so afraid?

304
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,820
 Have you still no faith?'

305
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,300
 And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this that even

306
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,380
 the wind and the sea obey him?'"

307
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,860
 So Jesus gets woken up and what does he do?

308
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,840
 He begins to talk to the sea.

309
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,820
 And I love it because in the original language of the New Testament, those words, "Peace,

310
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,980
 be still," do you know what they literally mean?

311
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,060
 It literally means be muzzled.

312
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,340
 So I don't know what type of image you have of Jesus in your head when you think about

313
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,440
 him calming the storm.

314
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,380
 But if your picture is of a meek and mild Jesus, kind of groggy, standing up, he's like,

315
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,380
 "Oh man, peace, dude, peace, peace, be still."

316
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,700
 No, it's be muzzled.

317
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,820
 It's shut up.

318
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,940
 Be quiet.

319
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,100
 I love that idea of like putting a muzzle on a barking dog.

320
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,100
 There was this TV show that used to be on a long time ago.

321
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,780
 It's called "The Dog Whisperer."

322
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,660
 I don't know if anyone in here ever encountered Cesar Millan is the dog whisperer.

323
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,660
 This show was fascinating.

324
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,420
 If you never saw it, let me just fill you in.

325
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,340
 Just try and picture this in your head.

326
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,820
 Like the show would start with a montage of clips of an unruly dog.

327
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,340
 I mean, the dog would be like biting its owner and barking at everyone that walked by and

328
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,580
 like eating the couch like in one swallow.

329
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,500
 Like it was nuts.

330
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,160
 And then Cesar would like pull up in his car and walk up to the door and knock and walk

331
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,900
 in and like within three seconds of Cesar being there, Cesar would just walk in, look

332
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,380
 at the dog and here's, this is all he would do.

333
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
 This is it.

334
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,420
 He would just go, "Hey, hey."

335
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:18,340
 And the dog would like stop eating the couch, look at Cesar, do the head tilt and fall over

336
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
 and die.

337
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,660
 It was crazy.

338
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,300
 It's crazy.

339
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,820
 He's the dog whisperer.

340
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,540
 And I think about that and I read this and I'm like, Jesus is the sea whisperer.

341
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:36,460
 He stands up, he's like, "Shut up, put a muzzle on it, be quiet."

342
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,820
 And in a moment in time, that sea goes from chaotic to calm.

343
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,380
 This is the power of Jesus.

344
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,860
 This is why I say you don't have to be in control because Jesus already is.

345
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,340
 Have you ever thought about the fact that Jesus was sleeping in the middle of a storm

346
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:58,180
 when everyone else on the boat is like, "This is it.

347
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,380
 This is how my life ends."

348
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,580
 And he's just asleep.

349
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,820
 He has to be woken up.

350
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,540
 Why was Jesus able to sleep in the midst of a, "I think we're going to die" type of storm?

351
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,360
 Because he wasn't threatened by the storm.

352
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,700
 He was already in control of the storm.

353
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,420
 Those waters had been created by God simply saying the word.

354
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,820
 Surely they could be calmed in the exact same way.

355
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,460
 And so can you just imagine if the great calm of the sea could become the great calm of

356
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,020
 your soul?

357
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,260
 Like when was the last time you just experienced peace?

358
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,420
 Like when I say that, when's the last time?

359
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,820
 Like try and date it.

360
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:56,460
 When's the last time you didn't have just that churning inside of you of stress?

361
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,780
 Like if you want the great calm of the sea to be the great calm of the soul, here's the

362
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
 good news.

363
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,660
 The apostle Paul, who wrote the majority of the New Testament, he helps us navigate the

364
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
 way.

365
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,380
 Here's what he says in Philippians chapter 4, verses 6 through 7.

366
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,180
 These are two verses that are great to commit to memory.

367
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
 But here's what he says.

368
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:25,220
 He says, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer, in supplication,

369
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,340
 with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

370
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:41,100
 In the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ

371
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
 Jesus."

372
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,380
 Okay, so this is it.

373
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,500
 Like if you want to experience peace, Paul is showing us the way.

374
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,620
 So let's just break it down.

375
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
 He says what?

376
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,260
 He says, "Do not be anxious about anything."

377
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,900
 Do you know what that is?

378
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
 That's a command.

379
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,340
 It's not a suggestion.

380
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,060
 That's a command from God through Paul to you.

381
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,820
 Do not be anxious about, and what's the next word?

382
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,740
 The next word is anything.

383
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,660
 Do not be anxious about anything.

384
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,980
 Do you know what the word anything means in the Greek?

385
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,580
 It means anything.

386
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580
 That's it.

387
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,860
 Do not be anxious about anything.

388
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,220
 And if you have a Bible, I just want you to look.

389
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,940
 Do you have an asterisk next to the word anything?

390
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,180
 No.

391
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:32,060
 There's no asterisk pointing you to a footnote where Paul caveats his statement with the

392
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,140
 things that it is okay to be anxious about.

393
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:43,420
 Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when inflation is happening.

394
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,980
 And you know what?

395
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,180
 Life is crazy right now.

396
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,140
 Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when you're single and you

397
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,460
 don't want to be.

398
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,780
 Do not be anxious about anything, asterisk, footnote, except when you lose your job and

399
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,340
 you don't know what is next.

400
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,380
 Now the command is do not be anxious about anything.

401
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,460
 And let me just say this.

402
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,700
 Some of you in here, you heard me start tonight by saying that stress isn't inevitable, it's

403
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
 actually optional.

404
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,340
 And now you're hearing me say it's a command, do not be anxious about anything.

405
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,940
 And that is stressing you out.

406
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:30,460
 So I just want to acknowledge that there is a clinical diagnosis of anxiety.

407
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,220
 And that is a real thing.

408
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,340
 And so when you hear me say, don't just, don't be anxious about anything, I'm talking to

409
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,900
 the majority of people in this room that our stress is situational.

410
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,820
 But you know what, if you have a clinical diagnosis, hey, it is okay to get help for

411
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,180
 that.

412
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,980
 It's okay.

413
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:58,020
 But what I want the majority of people in here to hear is this is a command, do not

414
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,220
 be anxious about anything.

415
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:06,580
 But then Paul goes on and says this, but in everything, but in everything.

416
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,140
 What's the Greek of everything?

417
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,140
 Everything, everything.

418
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,380
 You name it, it counts, but in everything, by what?

419
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,100
 By prayer and supplication.

420
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,220
 Here's what Paul is saying.

421
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,540
 He's saying if it's stressing you out, God cares about it and you should talk to Him

422
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
 about it.

423
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,740
 So let me just ask you this, whatever is stressing you out right now, have you talked to God

424
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
 about it?

425
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,940
 Here's what I didn't say.

426
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,940
 I didn't say have you talked at God about it.

427
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,780
 I asked you, have you talked with God about it?

428
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:47,100
 To talk at God about it is simply to allow God to eavesdrop on you as you process through

429
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,020
 what you're going to do to try and figure out your situation to try and get back in

430
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,060
 control.

431
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:02,860
 To talk at God about it is to go through the spiritual motions, but in the end, you're

432
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,700
 still going to try and quarterback your life.

433
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,140
 You're going to still try and control something that you can't control.

434
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,900
 So what I'm asking when I say have you talked to God about it is I'm asking you, have you

435
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:24,580
 gotten on your knees and have you just said, God, I can't, but you can.

436
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,260
 Like my shoulders are not sturdy enough to shoulder this thing that's going on in my

437
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
 life.

438
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
 So you know what?

439
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,140
 I'm going to control it onto your shoulders because your shoulders are sturdy enough for

440
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,900
 it and I trust you.

441
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,100
 And then at 15 minutes later, you know what?

442
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,980
 When you start stressing out again, you're going to get on your knees and you're going

443
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,140
 to be like, God, okay.

444
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,620
 So I'm stressing out again because I'm trying to control my life again.

445
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,460
 And so I just want to acknowledge that you, Jesus, you are before all things and in you

446
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
 all things hold together.

447
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:02,460
 So I'm going to trust you with the next 15 minutes of my life that you are in control.

448
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,900
 I trust you.

449
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,020
 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication.

450
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,220
 Now watch this.

451
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,700
 With thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

452
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,100
 Did you see that?

453
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,860
 It feels like Paul says, I want you to pray to God about it.

454
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,100
 I want you to thank God and I want you to let him know what you need.

455
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,660
 It feels like he got things out of order with that thanksgiving, like right there in the

456
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
 middle.

457
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,420
 It's like Paul was like, well, shoot, erasers don't exist yet.

458
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,020
 And I wrote it and, but I got it out of order.

459
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,740
 All right, we'll send it to print.

460
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:50,940
 Like it's what we want it to be is you stress out, you ask God to do something.

461
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,540
 God does something and then you say, thank you for it.

462
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,500
 Paul is saying you stress out, you talk to God about it.

463
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,660
 You thank him in the middle of it and you wait and watch for him to do something.

464
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,940
 Do you know what it looks like to thank God in the process?

465
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,340
 It's to look back and thank God for what he's already done in your life.

466
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,100
 Because when you look back and you remember that God has been faithful, it reminds you

467
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,740
 that he's capable.

468
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,360
 He's been faithful with your past.

469
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,140
 He's capable in your present.

470
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,620
 So I want you to try just thanking him for what he's already done.

471
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,740
 And then I want to encourage you to thank him for what he's going to do.

472
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,980
 This isn't like some like prosperity gospel, like God, I thank you that you are going to

473
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,700
 give me a wife tomorrow.

474
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,740
 That's not what I'm talking about.

475
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,860
 This isn't thank you God that when I go to the mailbox, there will be a check in the

476
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,860
 name of Jesus.

477
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,860
 That's not what I'm talking about.

478
00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:01,340
 No, I'm talking about like God, I thank you in advance that your will for my life is good,

479
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,020
 pleasing and perfect.

480
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,700
 I don't know what you are going to do.

481
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,980
 Honestly, God, I can't see a way out of this thing.

482
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:16,140
 But I thank you in advance that I am in your hands and I am safe there.

483
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:22,820
 And the worst thing that could happen, the worst thing that could happen is that you

484
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,340
 take me home to be with you.

485
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,420
 And that ain't that bad.

486
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,860
 It just puts it in perspective that God is in control.

487
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,940
 And so he says, do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication

488
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,780
 with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

489
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,380
 Watch this, what will happen?

490
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,900
 And in the peace of God, that's what we want.

491
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,020
 We want peace in the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding.

492
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
 What will it do?

493
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,700
 It will not, it might, it will guard two things.

494
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
 It'll guard what?

495
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
 Your heart.

496
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,020
 It's the seed of your emotions.

497
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,840
 It'll guard your heart and it'll guard your mind.

498
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:14,140
 Can you imagine reaching a place where your mind just, it just stops racing for five minutes.

499
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:20,380
 It stops trying to solve the equation and you can just rest even in the midst of the

500
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,620
 unknown.

501
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:33,260
 Paul is saying, this is what it looks like to flip the switch on your stress.

502
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:39,860
 Prior to moving to Dallas, I lived in College Station and prior to living there, yep, it's

503
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,580
 good to see you, Ax.

504
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:48,140
 Prior to College Station, we lived in Waco.

505
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:55,820
 And when we lived in Waco, it was when my kids were really young and we were renting

506
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,620
 a three bedroom house and I officed out of my bedroom.

507
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,220
 It was just, it was pretty depressing.

508
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,940
 It was like a chair in the corner of my bedroom.

509
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,620
 That was my office.

510
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,100
 And the ministry that I led, it met on Monday nights.

511
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,440
 And so a 6 p.m. on Monday nights was like go time of me trying to figure out exactly

512
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,580
 like where are we going tonight, God?

513
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,220
 Like what are we getting, what do you want to do?

514
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,460
 Well, 6 p.m. was also meltdown time for my kids.

515
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,460
 And so a good friend of mine figured that out and he bought me this $200 pair of Bose

516
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:36,780
 noise canceling headphones, which was amazing because like diapers could be exploding and

517
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,860
 kids could be melting down and all I had to do was put these headphones on and flip a

518
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,580
 switch and my life would go from chaotic to calm.

519
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,900
 I know this makes me sound like a really bad dad, but I'm just telling you reality, that

520
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,940
 the switch would get flipped.

521
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,780
 And Paul is saying if you want to flip the switch on your stress, here it is, don't miss

522
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
 it.

523
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
 Look inward instead of inward.

524
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,220
 Do you know what stress really is?

525
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:09,260
 It's a distress signal of your soul that you're looking inward instead of upward.

526
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,640
 You are actually made to look upward at God for your help.

527
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,580
 But our tendency is to look inward to try and figure it out ourselves.

528
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,060
 You don't have to be in control because Jesus Christ already is.

529
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,980
 The final truth that I need you to know if you want to address your stress is this, when

530
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,660
 you can't control life, you have two options.

531
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,380
 Here they are, fear or faith.

532
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,960
 Those are your two options.

533
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
 Why do I say that?

534
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,780
 It's because of what Jesus said right there at the end.

535
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,460
 Did you see what he said?

536
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,140
 He said, "The wind ceased," and there was a great column, verse 40, he said to them,

537
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,580
 "Why are you so afraid?

538
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,900
 Have you still no faith?"

539
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,660
 So Jesus is giving them the options.

540
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,340
 He's saying, "Look, why did you freak out?

541
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,520
 Why did you choose fear when you actually had a second option?

542
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,060
 You could have chosen faith."

543
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,060
 Why?

544
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,780
 Because I'm in your boat.

545
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,860
 I'm in your boat.

546
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:14,380
 The one who simply has to say the word is in your boat.

547
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:22,220
 The natural response to seasons of life where we feel out of control is fear.

548
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,180
 Stress is simply our response to the unknown.

549
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:32,860
 It's really just fear of not being able to control the outcome.

550
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,860
 It's not being able to see around the corner to see if everything's actually going to work

551
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
 out.

552
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
 That's all stress is.

553
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,740
 It's just fear of the unknown.

554
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,740
 The normal natural response is stress.

555
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,980
 And yet maybe God brought you here tonight so that you could simply hear that you have

556
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,980
 another option.

557
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
 It's faith.

558
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
 Why?

559
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,980
 Because he's in the boat of your life.

560
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,860
 The one who simply has to say the word is in the boat of your life.

561
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,420
 And he cares.

562
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,380
 He cares about your life.

563
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,180
 Like if you ever question if God cares for you, all you have to do is look at the cross

564
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,300
 of Jesus Christ.

565
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,900
 Like if you ever wonder if Jesus cares about your peace, all you have to do is look at

566
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,900
 the cross.

567
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,700
 Listen to what Colossians 1 says.

568
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,020
 It says this, "For in him," that's in Jesus, "all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell

569
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:35,780
 and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether on earth or in heaven, making

570
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,740
 peace by the blood of his cross."

571
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,980
 So here's what that's saying.

572
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:46,020
 It's saying the reason that we remember and we reflect on and sing about and talk about

573
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,900
 Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection is because Jesus died, was buried, and rose from

574
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,820
 the dead so that we could experience peace.

575
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,860
 See whether you realize it or not, every single one of us finds ourselves in a life-threatening

576
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
 storm.

577
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,960
 It's the storm of sin.

578
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,660
 Every single one of us, whether we realize it or not, we are not born right with God

579
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,700
 because not one of us lives the perfect life that God requires.

580
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:21,260
 And so when the storm of sin was threatening to separate each one of us from God for all

581
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,740
 of eternity, do you know what Jesus did?

582
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,820
 Is he got on a cross voluntarily.

583
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,500
 He was nailed to a cross.

584
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,300
 He was punished for you and for me.

585
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,820
 He died for your sins and for my sins.

586
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,060
 And when he hung on that cross, what were his final words on the cross?

587
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,740
 His final words were, "It is finished."

588
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:50,420
 And that was another way for Jesus to say, "Shut up.

589
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,540
 Be muzzled."

590
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:58,540
 To the storm of sin that was threatening to separate you and me from God for all of eternity.

591
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,660
 On the cross, Jesus conquered our sin.

592
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,980
 He was punished so that you wouldn't have to be.

593
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,860
 He was put in a tomb and he walked out of that tomb victoriously so that his victory

594
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:17,580
 could become your victory and you could be made right with God, not through your performance,

595
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,380
 but through his perfect work on the cross.

596
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,340
 Do you know that piece?

597
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
 Let's get real.

598
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,540
 You might be stressed out about your job.

599
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,500
 You might be stressed out about finances.

600
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:35,300
 You know what you really need to be stressed out about is if you're right with God.

601
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,420
 Because that's the one thing that matters for all of eternity.

602
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,140
 You know what the good news is?

603
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,420
 You don't have to stress out about that if you know Jesus.

604
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,700
 Because Jesus is before all things and in him all things hold together.

605
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,700
 And if you know him, then the wrath of God for your sin has been silenced for all of

606
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,860
 eternity.

607
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:09,100
 And you can enjoy peace with God for all of eternity because of Jesus Christ.

608
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,420
 I want to just answer the question real quick.

609
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:18,460
 If God truly loved us, why would he allow, why would he lead us into situations that

610
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,860
 we can't control?

611
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,180
 Let me just tell you one reason why I love the Bible.

612
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,340
 One of the reasons I love the Bible is because it gets us.

613
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,500
 What was the question that the disciples ran to Jesus with?

614
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,500
 Look back at the text.

615
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,060
 What was their question?

616
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,420
 Do you not care?

617
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
 Do you not care?

618
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,540
 Have you ever had that question to God?

619
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,720
 God, do you not care that I'm perishing?

620
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,100
 Do you not care that I don't know what I'm doing with the rest of my life?

621
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,980
 Do you not care that I don't have a job?

622
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,580
 Do you not care that finances aren't working right now?

623
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,640
 Do you not care that I'm lonely?

624
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,340
 Like the Bible gets us.

625
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,780
 It's not just a bunch of sugar-coated stories of people who live unrealistic lives.

626
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,580
 No, these were Jesus's closest friends and they're like, "I don't think you care about

627
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,620
 us."

628
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,940
 Why does Jesus lead us into situations that we cannot control?

629
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,400
 Here's the answer.

630
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,540
 Because it gives them an opportunity to show up in our lives.

631
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:23,780
 It gives us, it gives him an opportunity to show up and display his goodness and greatness

632
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,340
 in our lives.

633
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:34,540
 And what if Jesus knows that there is more joy waiting for you and for me in dependence

634
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,800
 than in control?

635
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,380
 What if he cares about us more than we care about ourselves and he cares about us enough

636
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,900
 to lead us to dependence upon him instead of us just letting us go trying to control

637
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,900
 our own lives?

638
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,300
 There is more joy in dependence than in control.

639
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,220
 It gives him an opportunity to show up.

640
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,020
 He might not show up how you think he should show up.

641
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,380
 He might not stop the storm, but his goodness and greatness might sustain you through the

642
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,300
 storm.

643
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:13,020
 Like the fact that you're here tonight, that's a demonstration of his goodness.

644
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,140
 Some of you might feel like you're barely standing.

645
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:24,220
 You're still standing because Jesus has allowed you to be sustained through the storm.

646
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:29,580
 I want to finish tonight just by focusing for a moment on Peter.

647
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
 Okay?

648
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,260
 And this is so cool, so I hope that you just stick with me for just a few more minutes

649
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,900
 so I can show you this connection.

650
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,740
 I want to focus for a minute on Peter.

651
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:45,180
 The reason I want to focus on Peter is because Mark, the one who wrote this book, he was

652
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:51,180
 not an eyewitness of Jesus or of this story.

653
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:59,100
 He was not an eyewitness of this story, and yet this story, it has the details of an eyewitness

654
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
 account.

655
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,940
 Like it mentioned the other boats around them.

656
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,660
 It talked about the cushion that Jesus was sleeping on.

657
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,580
 Where did Mark get his account?

658
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,300
 Most likely he got it from Peter.

659
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,820
 Okay?

660
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,820
 Now here's what we know about Peter.

661
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,700
 We know that the question that the disciples asked Jesus, "Do you not care that we are

662
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,740
 perishing?"

663
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,540
 We know that Peter at least thought that question.

664
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,620
 If you know anything about Peter, there's a good chance he's the one who said the question

665
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,540
 because Peter was kind of a speak first, think second kind of guy.

666
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,940
 But we know that that question at least represents how Peter felt.

667
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,940
 So how meaningful that years later, Peter would write these words in 1 Peter chapter

668
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
 5.

669
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,660
 He writes, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper

670
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:58,100
 time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him."

671
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,100
 Why?

672
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,620
 "Because he cares for you."

673
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,540
 Like I just picture Peter writing and he says, "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of

674
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
 God."

675
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,660
 And I just wonder, we have no way of knowing, but I wonder if as he wrote about the mighty

676
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,820
 hand of God, I wonder if he pictured Jesus' hand stretched out toward the sea and he's

677
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,700
 like, "Humble yourselves under those mighty hands, casting all your anxieties on him."

678
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
 Why?

679
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,540
 "Because I've run to him and I've questioned if he cares and he's shown up.

680
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,420
 He's calmed the storm in my life.

681
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,780
 I know he cares.

682
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:40,620
 Cares for me, cares for you."

683
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,220
 Several years ago I was dealing with some anxiety in my own life.

684
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,580
 And so I went to see a biblical counselor.

685
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,340
 About a biblical counselor is simply someone who takes the Bible and opens it up, listens

686
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,220
 to what you're struggling with, and then speaks to your struggle from the scriptures.

687
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,220
 And so just imagine, I go into this counseling appointment, I tell him I'm struggling with

688
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,860
 anxiety, so what story do you think he turned me to?

689
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,900
 Mark chapter 4.

690
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,500
 So we talk about Jesus calming the storm.

691
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
 Thanks a lot, counselor.

692
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
 Really good.

693
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
 That's great.

694
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,620
 Really appreciate it.

695
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,020
 Before the session ended, though, this is where the gold was in the session.

696
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:21,460
 He said, "Hey, you have to see the connection between Mark chapter 4 and Acts chapter 12.

697
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,460
 In Acts chapter 12, you don't have to turn there, but in Acts chapter 12, here's what's

698
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,460
 going on.

699
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:34,380
 At the beginning of Acts chapter 12, King Herod has just killed James, a Christian.

700
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:39,620
 And King Herod sees how pleasing it is to the people that he has just put a Christian

701
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,100
 to death, that he arrests Peter.

702
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:52,060
 And so we are left to assume that King Herod intends to put Peter to death.

703
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,780
 Now watch what we find Peter doing.

704
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,780
 Here's what it says.

705
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
 This is beautiful.

706
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,180
 Acts chapter 12, verses 6 through 7.

707
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,700
 It says, "Now when Herod was about to bring him out," bring him out to do what?

708
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,060
 Probably to kill him.

709
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,900
 On that very night, what was Peter doing?

710
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:16,140
 Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and sentries before the door

711
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,300
 were guarding the prison.

712
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,220
 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him and a light shone in the cell.

713
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,860
 He struck Peter on the side and woke him saying, "Get up quickly."

714
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,180
 And the chains fell off his hands.

715
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,820
 Here's why I love this so much.

716
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,740
 Peter found himself in the midst of a physical storm.

717
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:41,580
 And in the midst of that physical storm, what was Jesus doing?

718
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,380
 He was sleeping.

719
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,860
 Jesus Christ went to the cross, rose from the dead, and he had this special moment with

720
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,860
 Peter in John 21.

721
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,820
 And what did Jesus tell Peter?

722
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,620
 He said, "Hey, Peter, you follow me.

723
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,980
 Follow me."

724
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:05,220
 And Peter took him so seriously that on another night with a different type of storm, when

725
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:12,300
 his life was potentially about to end, what does Peter do?

726
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,780
 What he saw Jesus do on the cushion.

727
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,380
 He goes to sleep.

728
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,140
 He goes to sleep.

729
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,220
 That's peace.

730
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:35,540
 So if that's the goal, if the goal is to be able to sleep peacefully when potentially

731
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,620
 your life is on the line, can't we all agree that we all have some room to grow?

732
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,860
 Like we all have a step to take.

733
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,620
 Stress isn't inevitable.

734
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,660
 It's actually optional.

735
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,660
 Why?

736
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,140
 Because Jesus Christ is in the boat of your life.

737
00:45:54,140 --> 00:46:00,020
 The one who simply has to say the word is in the boat of your life, and he cares for

738
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,060
 you.

739
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,900
 So choose faith, not fear.

740
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,580
 Look upward instead of inward.

741
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:22,980
 Let's pray together.

742
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,140
 And I just want to ask you to listen to me right now.

743
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:32,820
 If you're sitting here in this room, and here's the reality, the thing that is stressing you

744
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:39,820
 out is if you were to die tonight, you don't know where you would be.

745
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,360
 You don't know if you're right with God.

746
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:49,840
 If that's you, you can put that stress to rest right now.

747
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:57,120
 Jesus says, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest."

748
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,380
 The scriptures say that all who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

749
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,340
 So if that's you right now, if you're sitting there just saying, "I want to know.

750
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,060
 I want to know Jesus.

751
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,060
 I want to be right with him.

752
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,460
 I want peace with God."

753
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:17,700
 If that's you, then let me just encourage you right in this moment, would you just pray

754
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,700
 along with me?

755
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,080
 Say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?"

756
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,540
 Just say, "Jesus, I believe that you died for me.

757
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:31,980
 I believe that you rose from the dead for me."

758
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,660
 Just say, "Would you come into my life?

759
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,740
 Would you forgive me of all of my sins?

760
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,940
 Would you make me right with God?"

761
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,340
 Just say, "I want complete peace with God."

762
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:53,940
 And then just tell him, "Would you begin to lead me in a new life as my Savior and as

763
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,740
 my King?"

764
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:03,060
 And then let me just ask, whoever is in here, I mean, the majority of the room, raise their

765
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,840
 hands that they feel stressed out, overwhelmed, out of control.

766
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,660
 If that's you, like, do business with the Lord now.

767
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,020
 Look upward now.

768
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,640
 Don't just talk at God, talk with him.

769
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,640
 Invite him in.

770
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,040
 Roll your stress onto his shoulders.

771
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
 Invite him in.

772
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,880
 Express your desperation for him to move.

773
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,800
 And at the same time, ask him to sustain you through the storm.

774
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,520
 If he chooses not to stop it, would you just ask him to sustain you through it?

775
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,400
 Lord Jesus, we need you.

776
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,620
 You are the Prince of Peace.

777
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,440
 You are the one who simply has to say the word.

778
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,640
 I just pray that you would come and calm our souls.

779
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:57,800
 I pray that we would all sleep better tonight than we have slept in a long time.

780
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,440
 I pray that for many of us, our brains would just turn off for a few minutes.

781
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:10,120
 I pray that that gnawing sense of stress or anxiety would just fall silent for a little

782
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
 bit.

783
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,680
 God, because you, Jesus, are in the boat of our lives and you care.

784
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,640
 Tonight, Lord Jesus, we choose faith.

785
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,280
 We choose to believe that you have been faithful in the past.

786
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,120
 You are capable in the present.

787
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:33,720
 And one day, we'll spend all of eternity with you, celebrating your faithfulness in the

788
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,900
 past, present, and forevermore.

789
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,540
 We need you.

790
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,860
 We love you.

791
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,080
 In Jesus' name, amen.
