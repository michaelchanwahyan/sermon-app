4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:36,640
 All right, Porsche, let's go.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,880
 How we doing?

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,600
 We doing OK?

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,440
 It's great to see you.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,840
 Man, it makes my week every weekend to be here with you.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,900
 Thanks so much for choosing to be here at the Porsche,

10
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,080
 not just in Dallas, Texas, but also all over the globe.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,160
 There's so many people tuning in with us all over the place.

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,760
 And so we want to just say a special hello.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,880
 If you're tuning in with us online somewhere,

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,520
 from wherever it is you stream, or if you're listening to this

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,240
 at some point in the future, welcome.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,440
 We're really glad to have you here.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,520
 Special shout out to Portslife, Dayton, Scottsdale, and Boise.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,600
 Let's give it up.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,080
 Hey, I want to do an exercise with you.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,360
 Now listen, this is going to be a rhetorical exercise.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,980
 I do not need you to speak back to me.

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,840
 I need you to think in the quietness of your inner self.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,340
 I want you to go through the halls of your personal history

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,840
 back to that very first moment where you felt

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,640
 some sense of personal panic, like some social embarrassment.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,180
 You can work your way back there while I tell you about mine,

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,280
 because mine was when I was in the seventh grade

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,000
 and I joined the football team for the very first time.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
 I know.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,120
 I had not grown up playing football.

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,880
 I had been around sports, baseball, soccer,

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,080
 but I had never really spent any time around football.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
 I didn't watch it.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
 I didn't know the rules.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,360
 I didn't know the position.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,040
 And yet what I knew is that I had a bunch of friends

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,440
 that were all joining the team, and so I was eager to jump

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,120
 on board with them as well.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,160
 So the day comes, and we make our way out

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,080
 to try out for a specific position.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,960
 But I didn't know anything about the sport,

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,040
 and so I picked the only position that I knew of.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
 I chose to try out for quarterback.

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
 Did I know any professional quarterbacks?

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,840
 No.

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,640
 Did I know how to spin the peel?

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,360
 No, I did not.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,480
 Did I know that it was the most important position

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,580
 on the team?

50
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,760
 Of course not.

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,600
 I just simply knew that this was an important position to--

52
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,680
 this was a position that everybody knew about.

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
 And so the day came for me to try out,

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,440
 and what I found out is that the tryout's really

55
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,800
 just a matter of you self-selecting

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
 into what you wanted.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
 So I got put into this position, and it was amazing.

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
 I started learning the role really well,

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,640
 and then eventually, as season started to approach,

60
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,520
 we got delegated into a variety of different teams.

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,360
 Much to my surprise, I was put on the A team, which

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,960
 was surprising to me because, listen, I was not

63
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,840
 under the illusion that I was God's gift to the sport

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
 of football.

65
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
 I knew that I had worked really hard,

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,240
 that I had given it the good college try,

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920
 that I had showed up early and I had stayed late.

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,240
 And I thought, man, this is just my coaches recognizing

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,680
 the fact that I had really gone for it.

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,840
 And so they're rewarding all of my effort.

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,160
 And so the day comes for us to make our journey

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
 to my very first football game.

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
 I grab my gear.

74
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,200
 I board the bus.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,400
 I say hey to my buddies, and we go to Paris, Texas.

76
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,960
 And in Paris, Texas, we offload from the bus,

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,720
 and I do what I always do.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
 I find my fellow quarterbacks, and I grab a ball,

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 and I start to warm up the old arm,

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,360
 like eye socket to hip pocket.

81
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,840
 I'm working my drills with these guys

82
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,520
 until eventually our coach comes over, and he does what he always

83
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,000
 does.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
 He does a head count.

85
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,320
 And then he does a second head count.

86
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,480
 And then he does a third head count.

87
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,240
 Because come to find out, he had one more quarterback

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,400
 than he was expecting--

89
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,120
 me.

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,000
 My name had accidentally been placed on the wrong roster.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
 And because I was not, in fact, qualified

92
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
 to quarterback the best of my 12-year-old companions,

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,440
 my coaches decided in that moment

94
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,760
 to remove me from the only position I was familiar with

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,640
 and put me in a completely different position

96
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,400
 that I had no familiarity with whatsoever.

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,040
 This is the stuff of prepubescent panic.

98
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
 OK?

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,960
 I was freaking out.

100
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
 Like, my whole world had flipped upside down.

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,240
 It felt like the sky was coming down on top of me

102
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,000
 because I was no longer playing on offense.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
 Now I was playing on defense.

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,360
 I was no longer calling the shots on the field.

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
 I was lost on the field.

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,840
 I had no idea what I was doing.

107
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,520
 I was not under the mistake that I was a part of the A team.

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,640
 No, I actually thought that I had made the mistake

109
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,680
 of playing this sport to begin with.

110
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,920
 You see, I had expected one thing,

111
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,000
 but I experienced something completely different.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,440
 Now, why do I tell you that?

113
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,640
 Because for many of us, faith can feel the same way.

114
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,640
 Like you boarded the bus of belief

115
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,240
 and you made your way out to the big game

116
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,880
 and then you offloaded and you realized,

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,680
 this is nothing like what I thought it was.

118
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,720
 Like, I thought not just that I'm lost on the field,

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
 I'm actually lost in my faith.

120
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,900
 It's not just that I am a part of the wrong roster.

121
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,480
 I might be a part of the wrong religion.

122
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
 It's not just that I'm questioning

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,640
 how to play this position.

124
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,120
 I'm actually questioning all of my claims to belief.

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,400
 Like, I'm in a position where I'm not sure

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,580
 that this is exactly what I thought it was supposed to be.

127
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,000
 I had some expectations,

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 but my experience in walking with God

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,160
 has not panned out like I thought it would.

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,920
 And the result is you've been left with disappointment.

131
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,600
 Brene Brown in her book "Rising Strong,"

132
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,560
 she says, "Disappointment is unmet expectations."

133
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,320
 And the more significant the expectations,

134
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,080
 the more significant the disappointment.

135
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
 And listen, there's nothing more significant

136
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,160
 about a person than what they believe about God.

137
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,840
 Which is why today, many young adults,

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,800
 some of you included,

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,080
 are actually on the road to deconstruction

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,960
 because your deconstruction from God

141
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,840
 is the result of your disappointment in God.

142
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,040
 Now, here's the thing that we need to know.

143
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,920
 When we wrestle with disappointment on God,

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,280
 there's a variety of different reasons

145
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,160
 why that could be happening.

146
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,820
 Like, it could be rooted

147
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,560
 in some sort of theological breakdown.

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,480
 Like, you thought you believed one thing,

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
 but then you learned something different,

150
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,680
 and now your spirituality is spiraling.

151
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,240
 It could be that you're facing a sociological dilemma.

152
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,800
 Like, you know Christians, and you know what they claim,

153
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,120
 but then you know the way they live,

154
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,760
 and all it feels like is hypocrisy,

155
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,200
 and all you can do is question the claims they say

156
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
 are in fact true.

157
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
 Maybe it's not theological, maybe it's not sociological,

158
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,160
 maybe it's just circumstantial.

159
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,360
 Like, you know God can show up,

160
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,520
 you know He will show up for others,

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,800
 but it just hasn't happened for you,

162
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,840
 and it feels like the circumstances in your life,

163
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,720
 they have gone from good to bad to worse.

164
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,560
 And again and again, you found yourself

165
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,520
 facing the unfairness of life,

166
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
 having your hopes dashed against the rocks of reality.

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,760
 Whatever the reason, for many people,

168
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,320
 their experience of Christianity

169
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,640
 is more synonymous with disappointment

170
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,220
 than enjoyment of God.

171
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,220
 So, if you're here, and you're somewhere

172
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,460
 on the road to deconstruction,

173
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,340
 at the very least wrestling with your belief,

174
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,140
 and at the very most walking away from your belief,

175
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,300
 then you need to know this talk is for you.

176
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,180
 Because we're gonna see Jesus engage with someone

177
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,040
 that is facing their own personal disappointment in God.

178
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,860
 So if you have a Bible, you can grab it,

179
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,460
 and you can turn with me to Matthew chapter 11.

180
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,380
 We've been in a series called "Deconstructed"

181
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,060
 because we know now more than ever before,

182
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,500
 people are questioning their faith,

183
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 and we don't think that's inherently a bad thing.

184
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,300
 A.J. Swoboda says it in his book, "After Doubt."

185
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,660
 "Deconstruction is a double-edged sword.

186
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,820
 "It can edify our faith

187
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,640
 "by helping us critically rethink wrong beliefs,

188
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,660
 "but it can also go too far and bring our faith to nothing."

189
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,580
 You see, there's a major difference in remodeling a room

190
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,540
 and tearing a house down.

191
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,680
 One is taking a space and making it more livable.

192
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,740
 The other is taking a space

193
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,940
 and rendering it completely inhospitable.

194
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,900
 My goal in this series,

195
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,660
 if you're here for the very first time,

196
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,180
 is I want to make the space where your soul resides

197
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,340
 as livable as possible.

198
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,460
 Like, I want your faith to flourish.

199
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,460
 Like, I want your inner person to thrive.

200
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,940
 And yet what we often have to do

201
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,220
 is we have to critically evaluate our belief

202
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,540
 and see what parts are weak.

203
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,780
 Like, what in the foundation feels cracked?

204
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,540
 What do we actually need to reassess?

205
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,420
 And then what does it look like

206
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,080
 to not just deconstruct what feels weak,

207
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,100
 but actually reconstruct something strong in its place?

208
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,540
 That's what we've been doing.

209
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,320
 And what we know is that as we step further

210
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,620
 inside the Christian story of reality,

211
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,460
 what we often have to do

212
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,820
 is deal with the disappointments we feel about that reality,

213
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,700
 which is what Jesus is going to do

214
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,780
 with a guy by the name of John the Baptist tonight.

215
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
 And so we'll pick it up

216
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,300
 as they kind of work through a series of steps

217
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,580
 on how to deal with disappointment.

218
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,780
 So it says this, Matthew chapter 11,

219
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,740
 starting in verse one,

220
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,700
 we're just going to take it little by little.

221
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,220
 "When Jesus had finished instructing his 12 disciples,

222
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,100
 "he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.

223
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,600
 "Now, when John heard in prison

224
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
 "about the deeds of the Christ,

225
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,960
 "he sent word by his disciples and said to him,

226
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,020
 "Are you the one who is to come

227
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,720
 "or shall we look for another?"

228
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,220
 Now, listen, if you know anything about John B,

229
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,660
 not John B from Outer Banks, but John B from the West Bank,

230
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,420
 what you need to know is that John the Baptist

231
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,020
 is Jesus' guy.

232
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,460
 Like his entire story is one of effectively serving life.

233
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,740
 Jesus is hype man.

234
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,580
 You know what that is?

235
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,620
 Like it's the guy that comes up

236
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,500
 before the main act takes the stage

237
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,780
 and gets the crowd excited

238
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,380
 and keeps injecting energy into the room,

239
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,780
 make sure the vibes are really great.

240
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,980
 Like that's who John is.

241
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,380
 He's the forerunner.

242
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,180
 Like it says that he's the one

243
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,100
 who came to prepare the way for God's Messiah,

244
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,740
 the anointed one of Israel.

245
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,100
 He baptized Jesus in the Jordan.

246
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,020
 He stood there and he heard the voice from heaven say,

247
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,340
 "This is my son with whom I'm well pleased."

248
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,520
 He also was self-identified as the voice in the wilderness

249
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,540
 claiming make straight the ways of the Lord.

250
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,640
 John was a spiritual giant.

251
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,420
 Think about it in your own life.

252
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,860
 Who is the best believer,

253
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,700
 like the fiercest of faith that you know?

254
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,860
 They don't stand a chance in comparison to John.

255
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,180
 John is a spiritual savant,

256
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,020
 literally at the very beginning of his life

257
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,660
 while he's still in his mother's womb.

258
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,860
 It says that he received the Holy Spirit.

259
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,500
 The best of us does not have that going for him, okay?

260
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,460
 John was just built different.

261
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,540
 And yet what we know is despite the fact that his history

262
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,780
 is marked by moments of incredible faithfulness

263
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,980
 in this story, what we find is a moment

264
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,140
 marked by weak faithfulness.

265
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,140
 And the reason for that is disappointment.

266
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,860
 You see, John is in prison for doing the right thing.

267
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,060
 He called out a wicked ruler by the name of Herod

268
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,700
 who had slept with his brother's wife, which is messed up.

269
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,480
 She also happened to be Herod's niece,

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,380
 which is really messed up.

271
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,580
 And so John is doing the only right thing

272
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,460
 and yet they're not facing judgment for their wrong.

273
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,780
 He is facing judgment for his righteousness.

274
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,740
 And that is disorienting.

275
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,460
 Like that's disillusioning.

276
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,380
 That's disappointing.

277
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,700
 Like, God, this is not the way it's supposed to be.

278
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,180
 Like I'm doing the right thing.

279
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,540
 I'm saying the right thing.

280
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,060
 I'm taking the right stand.

281
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,660
 Why God is this happening?

282
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,820
 Like Jesus, you're the one who's coming

283
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,620
 to deliver us from evil.

284
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,420
 And yet it feels like I'm being delivered

285
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,860
 straight into evil's hands

286
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,540
 as I await my own execution.

287
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,860
 If we're honest, some of us have felt that way

288
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,620
 or we feel that way here tonight with God.

289
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,660
 We have felt disappointed with them.

290
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,540
 We are asking the same question that John himself is asking.

291
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,980
 Hey, are you sure you're the right one?

292
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,820
 No, no, no, hold on.

293
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,640
 Let me clarify.

294
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,820
 Are you actually the right one

295
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,340
 or do I need to be looking for someone else?

296
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,580
 Because I've had great expectations of who you are.

297
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,660
 And yet my experience as I sit in prison

298
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,100
 for the last year to year and a half

299
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,620
 doesn't necessarily jive with what I expected.

300
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:50,700
 You see, John is helping us realize the first point

301
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,300
 as we talk through disappointment tonight

302
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,900
 that disappointment can lead to disenchantment.

303
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,840
 Disappointment can lead to disenchantment.

304
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,620
 Like you know this feeling.

305
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,980
 Like you go back and you watch a movie

306
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,260
 that you loved when you were a kid

307
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,220
 or you pull out all the toys that you used to play with

308
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,940
 or you go to the park, that place that you love

309
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,040
 from that time past or like me,

310
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,500
 maybe you collected rocks when you were a kid.

311
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,660
 That's kind of a weird thing to admit,

312
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,020
 but you go back and you look at it

313
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,860
 and you're like, man, this is actually

314
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,380
 a pretty shambly collection of rocks.

315
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,540
 I don't really know what I was doing.

316
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,660
 I just kind of picked these things up

317
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,020
 at some point at some time in the past.

318
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,780
 You look at the things you once took great delight in

319
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,460
 and yet you find them semi-disappointing

320
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,560
 because they're not what you thought.

321
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,100
 And then really what it does

322
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,340
 is it disenchants the entire experience that you remember.

323
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,060
 That's what's happening right here.

324
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,260
 That happens to Christians.

325
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,800
 Like we experience something in the faith

326
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,660
 that doesn't match what we expect

327
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,540
 and it not only makes us sad, it makes us skeptical.

328
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,060
 You wonder, Jesus, are you sure

329
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,860
 you're actually who you say you are?

330
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,060
 Are you someone different altogether?

331
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,540
 Because this is not playing out the way

332
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,020
 that I actually expected.

333
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,600
 Maybe it happened in your own life.

334
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,620
 Like you thought Jesus was supposed to be loving,

335
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,780
 but your experience with him has felt

336
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,620
 like he honestly could care less about you.

337
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,740
 Maybe you thought Jesus was supposed to be in control

338
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,820
 and yet you're dealing with some stuff

339
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,140
 and it feels like he's nowhere to be found.

340
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,100
 He has forgotten about you altogether.

341
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,180
 Or maybe you thought Christianity

342
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,460
 was meant to be more fulfilling.

343
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,260
 Like you've heard of this joy that Christians walk in

344
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,420
 and yet you've never found that.

345
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,340
 You've heard of the peace

346
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,300
 that's supposed to surpass all understanding

347
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,980
 and yet you've never felt that.

348
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,260
 You've heard of this forgiveness

349
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,780
 that transcends all wrongs

350
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,240
 and yet you don't know that you've ever received that.

351
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,420
 Maybe it's not something

352
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,500
 that's actually happening in your life.

353
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,340
 Maybe it's actually something

354
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,440
 that happened in someone else's life.

355
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,420
 Maybe it's a youth pastor that you grew up knowing

356
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,140
 or maybe it was a senior pastor of a church that you loved.

357
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,140
 Or maybe it wasn't that.

358
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,540
 Maybe it wasn't someone that worked for the church.

359
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,880
 Maybe it was someone that you went to church with,

360
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,740
 a parent or a brother or a sister

361
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,020
 or a spiritual mentor in your story.

362
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,300
 That man, they loved God so much.

363
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,540
 They loved God more than anybody you had ever known.

364
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,420
 And then they decided to walk away from it all.

365
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,600
 They punted on their faith.

366
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,380
 They denied their devotion.

367
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,260
 They went AWOL from everything they once believed.

368
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,180
 And as you have seen them leave it all behind,

369
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,700
 it's only left you wondering in the process

370
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,180
 if it wasn't real for them.

371
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,940
 Is it even real at all?

372
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,520
 That's what's happening to John in this moment.

373
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,920
 He has faithfully lived his life doing the right things,

374
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,600
 following the right theology, living in the right way.

375
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,280
 He has done everything right.

376
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,320
 But in this moment, he wonders if it's all wrong.

377
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,000
 Maybe you're here and you can resonate.

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,880
 Your belief is burning out.

379
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,760
 Your spiritual performance is exhausting.

380
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,580
 Your convictions are actually cracking.

381
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,640
 Your faith is growing faint.

382
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,580
 And you get John's question, the brutal honesty,

383
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,860
 the guttural nature of his question.

384
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,960
 Are you the right guy?

385
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,680
 He's, I'm not sure anymore.

386
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,440
 It's to that question that Jesus responds

387
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,300
 because he doesn't want disenchantment

388
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,740
 to be the end of John's nor your story.

389
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,420
 (congregation laughing)

390
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,780
 So he says this.

391
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,720
 And Jesus answered them,

392
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,780
 "Go and tell John what you hear and see.

393
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,740
 "The blind receive their sight and the lame walk.

394
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,180
 "Lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear,

395
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,580
 "and the dead are raised up,

396
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,700
 "and the poor, they have good news preached to them,

397
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,400
 "and blessed is the one who is not offended by me."

398
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,580
 Like in response to John's question

399
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,500
 about Jesus being the Messiah,

400
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,140
 Jesus answers with a messianic response.

401
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,700
 We won't go through all of the text,

402
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,340
 and yet what you see is Jesus pulls

403
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,180
 on four different messianic prophecies

404
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,820
 from Isaiah 29, 35, 42, and 61,

405
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,380
 all of which John would have been extremely familiar with

406
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,780
 because Jesus, he wants to engage John's disappointment

407
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,660
 and to keep it from becoming disenchantment.

408
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,780
 He wants to speak the most enchanting words.

409
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,620
 It's amazing.

410
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,460
 It's really, it's actually pretty beautiful.

411
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,420
 He's looking at him and he's saying,

412
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,700
 "Hey man, I know you think I'm not who I say I am,

413
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,500
 "and yet let me just tell you from the book you believe in

414
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,460
 "that I am in fact who you want me to be.

415
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,480
 "Like I have done what only the Messiah can do.

416
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,520
 "Like the blind can see, the lame can walk,

417
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,620
 "like the sick are healed,

418
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,000
 "the deaf can hear, the dead are raised.

419
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,980
 "I am exactly who you want me to be."

420
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,920
 You see, Jesus, he does all of this for John

421
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,120
 and he does it for you and I

422
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,740
 because he wants you and me to know

423
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,980
 that Jesus turns rumors into reality.

424
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,820
 Jesus turns rumors into reality.

425
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,640
 You ever felt that?

426
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,780
 You ever read the Bible and wondered like,

427
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,180
 "Man, this feels like a joke."

428
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,460
 Or, "Man, this doesn't feel like a joke.

429
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,640
 "This feels true, but that's definitely not real

430
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,940
 "in my world."

431
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,500
 Jesus is like, "Man, all of that biblical rumor, it's real.

432
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,320
 "It's actually biblical reality.

433
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,700
 "And I'm gonna help you find it."

434
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,380
 That's what Jesus is saying to John.

435
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,660
 That's what he's saying to us

436
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,180
 because the Christian life is not a sensible reality at all.

437
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,860
 It is a spectacular one.

438
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,060
 Like according to the Bible, don't miss this,

439
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,940
 Christians, they not only believe that God exists,

440
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,900
 we believe that whole seas split in half,

441
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,640
 that heaven breaks into the earth,

442
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,420
 that pillars of fire fall from the sky.

443
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,340
 Whoosh, animals, they talk out loud,

444
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,200
 angelic armies, they appear to protect

445
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,380
 that the existence of an invisible reality

446
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,060
 actually does exist,

447
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,840
 that dragons and giants and demigods are all real,

448
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
 that supernatural gifts are given,

449
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,440
 not just to the people in this book,

450
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,880
 but to people like you in these seats.

451
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,840
 We also believe that people speak in languages

452
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,280
 that they never learned at some point in the past,

453
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,040
 that the sun itself stood still,

454
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,740
 that a resurrection from the dead is possible,

455
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,520
 and there is life everlasting

456
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,280
 to anyone who believes in Jesus.

457
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
 That's what we believe.

458
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,940
 There's nothing sensible about that.

459
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,040
 It is sensational.

460
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,320
 Reality for the Christian is more magical than materialism.

461
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,740
 It's more sensational than your circumstance.

462
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,920
 That's why Jesus says to John,

463
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,620
 "Hey, everything that you've expected of me, it's true."

464
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,400
 The blind, they see.

465
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,820
 The lame, they walk.

466
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,980
 The deaf, they hear.

467
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,240
 The sick are healed.

468
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,120
 The dead, they rise.

469
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,920
 Everything you expected is in fact true.

470
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,940
 Do not let your circumstances dictate your judgment,

471
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,400
 which is a really fair warning for me and for you,

472
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,340
 because our expectations of Jesus,

473
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,160
 they can be clouded by our experiences in life.

474
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,220
 Let me say it again.

475
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,840
 In yours, in my expectations,

476
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,200
 they can be clouded by our experiences in life.

477
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,160
 So think about it this way.

478
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,080
 It's kind of as if the circumstances in your life

479
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,120
 are like the weather.

480
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,800
 Some days, sun's shining, birds are singing,

481
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,360
 clouds are just floating by.

482
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
 You can make shapes of them if you like.

483
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,360
 And Jesus is so very clear.

484
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,000
 He's easy to see, even when you're not close to him,

485
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,940
 when he's across the way,

486
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,260
 'cause you've not spent a lot of time together

487
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,240
 as of times recent, and yet you can still see him.

488
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
 Yet there are other moments

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,560
 where the circumstances aren't so bright and shining.

490
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,800
 Where storm heads roll forward,

491
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,520
 the fog begins to rise,

492
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,940
 the thunder begins to rumble.

493
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,060
 And Jesus isn't so easy to pick out any longer.

494
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:33,600
 Porch, like the clouds,

495
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,800
 your circumstances are always moving.

496
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,100
 It may be dark today, it will be bright tomorrow,

497
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,580
 but that which does not change is Jesus.

498
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,040
 He stands with you, he stands for you.

499
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,840
 You need only keep your eyes fixed on him.

500
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,040
 It is possible for two things to be true.

501
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,920
 Life can be hard, and yet God can be good.

502
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,460
 Those two things can be true side by side at the same time.

503
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,920
 Hebrews 13, eight tells us a really simple,

504
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,360
 but a really profound verse.

505
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,280
 If you're in the business of trying to put things to memory,

506
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,780
 you should put this to memory,

507
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,880
 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

508
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
 What does that even mean?

509
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,120
 It means that Jesus never, ever, ever changes.

510
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,560
 His feelings for you, they are the same.

511
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,720
 Yesterday and today and tomorrow.

512
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 So it doesn't matter.

513
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,700
 Like you may feel shame for something

514
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,200
 that happened in the past,

515
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,920
 and yet his forgiveness still reaches for you right now.

516
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,280
 Like you may be struggling against something

517
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,360
 here in the present, and yet Jesus wants you to know,

518
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
 my strength is sufficient for you today.

519
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,680
 You may be feeling some deep sense of fear

520
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,500
 about something out in the future,

521
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,720
 and yet Jesus wants you to know,

522
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,500
 hey, I stand beside you and we will walk together

523
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,720
 towards it.

524
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,960
 Like he never changes, and so our expectations of him

525
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,920
 should not change either,

526
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,080
 even when our circumstances say differently.

527
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,160
 But Kylan, doesn't he have the power

528
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,480
 to change my circumstances?

529
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,560
 Yes!

530
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,540
 But that doesn't mean he will.

531
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,040
 He absolutely has the power to change your circumstances.

532
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,880
 He has the power to change John's circumstances,

533
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,040
 yet it does not mean that he will.

534
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,020
 It's actually, it's really interesting.

535
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,860
 If you look at the passage we're studying,

536
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,240
 the words that Jesus has John's disciples

537
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,240
 bring back to him, they're full of messianic prophecy,

538
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,680
 all of which Jesus is the fulfillment of.

539
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:38,760
 And yet Jesus conveniently excludes

540
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,100
 one element of the prophecy.

541
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,580
 He excludes

542
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,340
 (pages rustling)

543
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,380
 liberty of the captives,

544
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,240
 and the opening of the prison to those who are bound.

545
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,980
 He does not, in anything that is so far from ironic,

546
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,100
 tell John what John wants to hear.

547
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,500
 He has the power to change John's circumstance,

548
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,120
 but he chooses not to.

549
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,780
 He can absolutely give to John what John wants,

550
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:23,020
 but he knows what John needs.

551
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,980
 He knows that the best way to deal with disappointment

552
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,100
 isn't by changing your circumstances

553
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,940
 to accommodate your faith in God.

554
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,200
 The best way to deal with disappointment

555
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,020
 is to grow your faith to deal with any and every circumstance

556
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,580
 that would test you from your God.

557
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,940
 He won't give you what you want.

558
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,740
 He will give you what you need.

559
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,460
 And the beauty of it is, it always leads you nearer to him.

560
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,620
 He wants to keep you close by, near to himself,

561
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,460
 not dependent or satisfied or contented

562
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,280
 by anything else in this world.

563
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,760
 No, he wants you to cling to him,

564
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,220
 not circumstantial comfort.

565
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,860
 That's what he's doing for John.

566
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,300
 That's what he'll do for you.

567
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,980
 As it keeps going in verse seven, it says,

568
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,580
 "As they went away, Jesus began to speak

569
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,380
 "to the crowds concerning John.

570
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,900
 "What did you go out into the wilderness to see?

571
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,400
 "A reed shaken by the wind?

572
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,080
 "What then did you go out to see?

573
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,980
 "A man dressed in soft clothing?

574
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,700
 "Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in king's houses.

575
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,640
 "What then did you go out to see?

576
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,120
 "A prophet?

577
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,560
 "Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

578
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,820
 "This is he of whom it is written,

579
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,900
 "Behold, I will send my messenger before your face

580
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
 "who will prepare your way before you.

581
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,040
 "Truly I say to you, among those born of women,

582
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,660
 "there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist,

583
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,620
 "yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven

584
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,940
 "is greater than he."

585
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,660
 I love this.

586
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:02,700
 Jesus is not frustrated with John in this moment.

587
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,420
 He hears word of John's doubt, even John's disappointment.

588
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,500
 And he's not annoyed by it.

589
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,060
 He looks at the crowds that are listening in

590
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,040
 and he's like, "Hey, this is my boy, John.

591
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,740
 "There's no one born among women who is greater."

592
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,860
 That's a high compliment.

593
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,060
 That's a big thing to say.

594
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,620
 He also looks at the crowds and he's like,

595
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,660
 "What did you go out to see?

596
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,180
 "A reed shaken in the wind?"

597
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,380
 John, he's not concerned with public opinion.

598
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,820
 He doesn't care what you think about him.

599
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,180
 He cares what God thinks about him.

600
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,500
 What, you went out to see if he wore soft clothing?

601
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,220
 No, like he isn't allured by creature comforts.

602
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,200
 He doesn't need to sit in the halls of power

603
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,940
 like king's courts because he sits with God.

604
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,580
 John is not concerned with you.

605
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,420
 He does not do what he does

606
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,760
 by way of the dictation of others.

607
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,380
 He's a prophet.

608
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,540
 He's my prophet.

609
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,580
 He's the greatest among women

610
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,740
 or the greatest among those born of women.

611
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,620
 Jesus is not in the slightest disappointed with John,

612
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,780
 which should be wildly encouraging to us

613
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,340
 because we may grow disappointed in God from time to time,

614
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,700
 and yet God does not grow disappointed in us.

615
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,460
 God does not magnify your mistakes.

616
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,140
 He magnifies his grace.

617
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,260
 Like he doesn't fixate on your sins.

618
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,660
 He forgives them instead.

619
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,900
 He doesn't emphasize your shortcomings.

620
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,180
 He embraces you despite them.

621
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:48,220
 You may be disappointed with God at times,

622
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,620
 yet he is never disappointed with you.

623
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,660
 Romans 8, one, famous verse,

624
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,580
 which you should preach to yourself daily says,

625
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,780
 there is therefore now no condemnation

626
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,300
 for those that are in Christ Jesus,

627
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,520
 not even a condemnation which you might ascribe

628
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,220
 as true of yourself.

629
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,420
 There's none.

630
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,580
 You can self-condemn, but it is not what God condemns

631
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,820
 because we know for the law,

632
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,140
 the spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus

633
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,660
 from the law of sin and death.

634
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,820
 Now, let me be abundantly clear.

635
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,500
 This does not mean that we should overlook our sin.

636
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,220
 Doesn't mean that we should pacify our depravity.

637
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,620
 We should leverage grace like a license

638
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,840
 or hall pass to do whatever we want.

639
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,580
 That's not what this is saying.

640
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,460
 And yet what it is saying is that though we may feel

641
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,940
 despondent in life and disappointed in God,

642
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,020
 we do not run from him.

643
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,100
 We run towards him.

644
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,180
 Because when there was good reason

645
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,980
 to be disappointed in you,

646
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,900
 he did not run from you.

647
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,620
 He ran to you.

648
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,780
 He came after you through hell and high water.

649
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,500
 He made quick haste to get to those whom he loved,

650
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,060
 though there was nothing lovable about them.

651
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,700
 This is who our God is.

652
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,940
 He's not disappointed with you.

653
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,740
 He's wildly crazy about you.

654
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,340
 And yet it's not because of something that we've done,

655
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,740
 nor we've earned, nor we've merited,

656
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,100
 but simply because he chooses to lavish love.

657
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,100
 He welcomes your questions.

658
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,140
 He's not afraid of your doubts.

659
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,540
 He's not offended by your frustrations with him.

660
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,140
 Eugene Peterson says,

661
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,760
 "The reason many of us do not ardently believe

662
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,500
 "in the gospel is that we've never given it

663
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,460
 "a rigorous testing.

664
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,820
 "We've never thrown our hard questions at it.

665
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,060
 "Face it with our most prickly doubt."

666
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,660
 What's Eugene saying?

667
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,580
 True faith does not walk out on Jesus

668
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,380
 when he fails to meet our expectations.

669
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,000
 It leans into Jesus that he might help you sort it out.

670
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,380
 And the reason for that is because there is no road

671
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,140
 to maturity without disappointment.

672
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,260
 There's no road to maturity without disappointment.

673
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,940
 There was no one like John B, okay?

674
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,980
 Like he was the greatest born among women,

675
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,900
 and yet what we know is that John's maturity

676
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,180
 was not the result of an absence of disappointment,

677
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,360
 but the presence of it.

678
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,320
 How do you grow in maturity?

679
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,260
 Not by age, not by intelligence.

680
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,160
 You grow through experience.

681
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,600
 Don't miss this.

682
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,000
 Especially those experiences

683
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,880
 which do not meet your expectations.

684
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,340
 Those experiences which lead to your disappointment.

685
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,040
 That's why you can't just apply

686
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,840
 for whatever job you want in life.

687
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,380
 Some of you are in the job hunt right now,

688
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,300
 and yet what you need to know

689
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,080
 is that some positions require experience.

690
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,580
 Because at some point,

691
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,840
 as you ascend into the heights of hierarchical power

692
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,880
 within corporate America,

693
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,240
 it doesn't matter how many degrees you have,

694
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,060
 it doesn't matter how many letters are after your name,

695
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,880
 or how many books nor knowledge you know,

696
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,600
 what matters are the problems you've solved,

697
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,760
 the issues you've addressed,

698
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,720
 the challenges you've faced.

699
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,640
 You need experience,

700
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:30,160
 which is not learned, but lived.

701
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:36,760
 You and I, if we want to grow,

702
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,200
 particularly into godliness,

703
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,560
 we need to live through some disappointment.

704
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,800
 We need to be willing to undergo some adversity.

705
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,920
 Now, let me just say, in a room this size,

706
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,640
 I'm not too naive to know

707
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,960
 that the amount of disappointment felt is deep,

708
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,560
 and the source of that disappointment is broad.

709
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,520
 But I'm also not too naive to know

710
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,560
 that God is working through those disappointments

711
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,400
 for your good.

712
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,640
 Like, some of you are so disappointed

713
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,720
 that your walk with God doesn't feel sensational.

714
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,960
 It feels sensible.

715
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,600
 But what you need to know is that God is at work.

716
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,080
 Like, God is stirring up in you a holy discontent

717
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,400
 to break you out of your sensibilities.

718
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,400
 He wants you to wrestle and question and struggle

719
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,160
 and wonder for more of him.

720
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,880
 This has been my reality for the last two years.

721
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,680
 I'll just level with you, porch.

722
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
 I don't want to play the Christian game.

723
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,720
 I don't want to stand on stage and look the part.

724
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,240
 I don't want to say the right things

725
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,600
 yet not actually mean them.

726
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,180
 I don't want to read this book and know it's true

727
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,180
 yet not actually believe it.

728
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,560
 I want this to be real.

729
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,720
 Like, I want this book and the lessons I've learned

730
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,640
 and the lives I've seen to be real in my own experience.

731
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,320
 I pray every single day,

732
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,400
 God, would you be real to me?

733
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
 Would you be real to me?

734
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,860
 Would you be real to me, God?

735
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,200
 I don't just want to live in a world full of rumor.

736
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,040
 I want to live into the kind of reality

737
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,080
 that you've come to bring.

738
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,880
 Help me, God.

739
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,680
 Unlock me from these sensible ways

740
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,760
 and unleash me, God, into a spectacular life.

741
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,080
 And by his grace, he's doing it.

742
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,840
 If he'll do it for me, he will do it for you.

743
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,480
 I promise you he will.

744
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,000
 Not because you earned it, man, you deserve it.

745
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,840
 You know what?

746
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,800
 You look like you actually could use it.

747
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,360
 No, he will do it just simply because he cares

748
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,440
 for you to know him as he is.

749
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,240
 Does anybody want that?

750
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,880
 It's available.

751
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,860
 It's available.

752
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,200
 Some of you are disappointed that you know what's true,

753
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,840
 you just don't feel what's true.

754
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,740
 But God's at work.

755
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,260
 Like, he's renewing your mind beyond sterile knowledge

756
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,800
 in leading you into a beautiful and bold belief.

757
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,920
 Like, here's the thing.

758
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,920
 Maybe instead of just doing Christianity the right way,

759
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,320
 you should do it in the way that works for you.

760
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,760
 Maybe you should read your Bible at night.

761
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,040
 Maybe you should read through your journal.

762
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,760
 You should draw in your journal.

763
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
 Like, maybe you should read books.

764
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,160
 You should listen to audio books.

765
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,800
 But man, that's not as spiritual as those guys

766
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,360
 that sit down, they just read book after book

767
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,200
 after book after book.

768
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,120
 Who cares?

769
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,700
 Like, the right way of doing things is the way

770
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,700
 that leads you to love Jesus as revealed by his word more.

771
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,460
 So do that.

772
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,180
 My goal every day is to end the day and love Jesus more

773
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,600
 than I did at the beginning of it.

774
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,600
 I will relentlessly pursue that in my life.

775
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,160
 And I am giving you permission to do the same.

776
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,940
 Some of you were disappointed that God hasn't answered

777
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,820
 that prayer that you've been praying.

778
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,380
 But listen, man, he is at work.

779
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,820
 He is inviting you not just to trust in him,

780
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,500
 but to process with him, to plead with him,

781
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,400
 to implore him, to not pull your punches,

782
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,900
 to maybe forget your manners when you pray to him.

783
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,320
 Maybe to yell.

784
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,080
 God had no issue with those that grumbled to him.

785
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,540
 He took issue with people that grumbled about it,

786
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,860
 but wouldn't actually come and talk to him about it.

787
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,260
 He can handle your problems.

788
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,280
 He already knows.

789
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,060
 It's not secret.

790
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,900
 He's very clearly aware of what's going on in here.

791
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,700
 So why don't you tell him about it?

792
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,060
 He's already aware.

793
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,900
 And the beauty of it is,

794
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,020
 is he actually wants to listen to you.

795
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,620
 Isaiah 62, 6, 7, it's amazing.

796
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,620
 It says, "On your walls, O Jerusalem,

797
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,980
 I have set watchmen all day and all night.

798
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,140
 They shall never be silent.

799
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,160
 You who put the Lord in remembrance, take no rest.

800
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,940
 Give him no rest until he establishes Jerusalem

801
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,660
 and makes it a praise in the earth."

802
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,700
 What's that saying?

803
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,740
 God is saying, "Don't quit asking me.

804
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,100
 Don't quit talking to me.

805
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,540
 Don't quit processing with me.

806
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,620
 Don't quit praying to me.

807
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,240
 Don't quit pleading with me.

808
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,140
 Give me no rest.

809
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,580
 Be in constant, incessant annoyance in my life

810
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,940
 because I love you and I want to hear from you."

811
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,440
 Some of you are disappointed that God hasn't given you

812
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,460
 what you really and rightly have wanted.

813
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:43,180
 A husband, a wife, a job,

814
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:50,260
 some opportunity, rest, healing, friends.

815
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,940
 You have rightly wanted and you have patiently waited.

816
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,780
 But God's at work.

817
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:05,700
 He's calling you to wait with him, not just on him.

818
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,620
 Not just on him.

819
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:18,380
 He would be glad to let you wait longer

820
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:23,140
 if it brings you closer

821
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,680
 because he cares about you that much.

822
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,780
 Some of you have waited for so long.

823
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,500
 To God, a day is, a year is but a day.

824
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,860
 Time is so very far outside of him.

825
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,940
 If it feels like it's taking long,

826
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,000
 it's because he wants longer with you.

827
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,280
 Maybe instead of waiting on him,

828
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,780
 you just need to wait with him.

829
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,960
 God does not waste disappointment.

830
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,020
 He wants to use it.

831
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,060
 Last story.

832
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,540
 In 1951, shortly after relocating his family to Switzerland,

833
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,460
 Francis Schaeffer, a theologian and an apologist

834
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,900
 who defended the Christian faith

835
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,820
 following the post-war era,

836
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,140
 he underwent the most influential faith crisis of his life.

837
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,780
 Today, we know that his crisis

838
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,940
 was known as the Hayloft experience

839
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,780
 where for three months,

840
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,140
 he plunged into the darkness

841
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
 of his own personal deconstruction

842
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,660
 and paced the Hayloft of his Swiss chalet

843
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,100
 seeking answers about God.

844
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,780
 You see, Francis had been one of the lead members

845
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,740
 in a brand new evangelical movement,

846
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,500
 one that was zealous for theological precision

847
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,380
 and ecclesiological correctness,

848
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,940
 and yet as he spent time amongst this movement

849
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,340
 and they began to build momentum,

850
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,860
 he grew disappointed

851
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,980
 in the fact that they were zealous

852
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
 for all manner of other things

853
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,060
 except loving their neighbors.

854
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,620
 And so it was out of this movement,

855
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,300
 frustrated by the fact that people

856
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,380
 were more focused on serving Jesus

857
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,600
 than actually enjoying Jesus,

858
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,140
 that he took an existential hiatus

859
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,820
 and he sought after God

860
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,860
 and he set himself to answer this question

861
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,060
 as quoted by him,

862
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,900
 if so many zealous Christians

863
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,940
 were lacking the reality central to Christianity,

864
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,860
 is Christianity itself even real?

865
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:47,180
 As he recalls, he had known that,

866
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,740
 he had to know that Christianity was real,

867
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,300
 that one could experience a true sense of God's presence

868
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,420
 and that the scriptures were in fact

869
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,900
 God's revelation to man.

870
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,500
 And he committed that if by the end of his questioning,

871
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,980
 he couldn't emerge from his hayloft

872
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:04,460
 with a deep sense of the reality of it all,

873
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,060
 then he would altogether abandon the faith forever.

874
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,060
 By the end of those three months,

875
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,700
 pacing back and forth in his Swiss chalet,

876
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,220
 Francis emerged

877
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,700
 and what was once an existential crisis

878
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,780
 was replaced by existential bliss

879
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,500
 as he learned,

880
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
 my God is real,

881
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,420
 his word is true

882
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,860
 and he does save.

883
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,940
 I will go to him,

884
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,620
 I will be with him

885
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,940
 and I will be his forever.

886
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,660
 Francis made a commitment in conviction,

887
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,580
 believing all these things are actual reality,

888
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:58,300
 stepping further into the experience that God was inviting

889
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,780
 and because he did,

890
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,020
 his life changed,

891
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,620
 his family's life changed

892
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,340
 and the entire world changed

893
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,820
 to the point that we're standing in a room

894
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,460
 with several thousand young adults

895
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,820
 talking about it right now.

896
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,940
 Friend, are you disappointed with God?

897
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:22,380
 Perhaps your experience does not meet your expectation

898
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,980
 because Jesus is calling you to a new experience

899
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,180
 that you know not even to expect.

900
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,060
 That's what the gospel promises.

901
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,660
 The gospel is a message of God liberating us

902
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,820
 out of the disappointment of our status,

903
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,540
 lost in sin,

904
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,940
 estranged from God,

905
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,500
 enemies to one another

906
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,260
 and hating our brother

907
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,620
 and yet Jesus came to solve the disappointment in our life.

908
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:58,500
 All the fulfillment we sought,

909
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,340
 yet could never find,

910
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
 he came to give.

911
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,060
 All the purpose we longed for,

912
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,980
 yet could never find,

913
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,260
 he came to offer.

914
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,180
 All the hope that we wanted,

915
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,420
 yet could never attain,

916
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,700
 he came to bestow.

917
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,020
 You see, Jesus,

918
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,420
 he came to enchant the disenchanted.

919
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,460
 (gentle music)

920
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,460
 Son of God,

921
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,580
 enthroned in glory,

922
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,580
 become son of man,

923
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,100
 down here with the lowly

924
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,340
 because he wanted to take you,

925
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,780
 a disenchanted poor soul

926
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,500
 and enchant you

927
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,620
 into the experience of a son and daughter of God.

928
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:46,100
 Jesus came to turn a rumor into reality.

929
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,460
 Rumor has it that we had no hope,

930
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,700
 yet Jesus knew he could change that story

931
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,540
 by living the life we could not,

932
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,660
 dying the death we deserve,

933
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,100
 being buried in our place,

934
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,780
 yet rising forth from the grave

935
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,460
 to replace the rumor of your eternal condemnation

936
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,500
 with one of everlasting life.

937
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,860
 And Jesus came to mature the immature,

938
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,220
 not apart from our disappointment,

939
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,100
 but by bearing our disappointment,

940
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,340
 the disappointment of our sin in himself.

941
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,580
 There's an experience of God that will never disappoint

942
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:33,380
 because that experience of God has a name

943
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,460
 and his name is Christ,

944
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,980
 Jesus Christ.

945
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,780
 He's come to seek the lost.

946
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,660
 He's come to save.

947
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,820
 He's come to save the dead,

948
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,340
 liberate the captive

949
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,340
 and give you the enjoyment

950
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,180
 you so very much long for in this life.

951
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,300
 Do you believe it's true?

952
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,140
 Because it quite in fact is.

953
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,020
 Let me pray you would.

954
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,020
 God, we love you.

955
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,660
 Oh God, I pray

956
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,060
 that you and I,

957
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,460
 we have talked about this so much,

958
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:27,540
 that God, I want the porch

959
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,820
 to be a place

960
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,100
 of experiential spirituality

961
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:42,100
 where everything we read is true.

962
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,140
 We would realize as true in our own lives

963
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,020
 that God, we would know

964
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,460
 your presence isn't just something we study about.

965
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,180
 It isn't just something we know about.

966
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,260
 Your presence is here

967
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,700
 and we get to be loved by you.

968
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,340
 Oh God, I pray that you would pierce

969
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,060
 whatever barriers exist within this room

970
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,860
 and over our hearts, God,

971
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,860
 and you would liberate us from sterile Christianity,

972
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,820
 boring spirituality,

973
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,540
 and you would lead us, God, into an experience,

974
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,460
 not an emotional experience,

975
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,820
 but God, a real and genuine experience of you

976
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,900
 that leads us, God, to claim this must be true.

977
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,300
 There's no other explanation

978
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,580
 than the fact that God is who he says he is,

979
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,900
 that Jesus Christ has come to save

980
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,260
 and he has in fact saved me.

981
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,420
 I pray, God, that even in this next moment,

982
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,260
 we would stand to our feet,

983
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,220
 we would not rush from this room,

984
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,020
 and we would sing to you,

985
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,740
 not at you, but to you.

986
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,660
 We would pray to you,

987
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,460
 not at you, but to you.

988
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,380
 And God, we would hear from you

989
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,660
 because one word from you can change a person forever.

990
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,900
 We love you.

991
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,100
 And it is in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

992
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,900
 Hey, porch, let's stand to our feet.

993
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,580
 Everything we just talked about, we are about to do.

994
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,100
 We have worshiped, we have taught,

995
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,100
 and now we're going to experience the goodness of God.

996
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,740
 We're gonna declare to him

997
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,020
 that he and he alone is worthy of our pursuit.

998
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,300
 So let's sing to him now.

999
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,340
 If you need to pray with people,

1000
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,300
 we've got folks down, the stage left, stage right,

1001
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,820
 they'd love to engage with you.

1002
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,620
 The time is yours, the king is here.

1003
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,980
 Let's sing to him together.

1004
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:05,980
