1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,800
 - All right, hey, welcome everybody in the room,

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,260
 everybody tuning in online, yeah, get excited.

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,760
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,680
 Let's go, man, y'all are rowdy tonight.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,220
 PortsLive, welcome all the PortsLive locations,

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,660
 in particular Scottsdale, Boise, Midland, North Houston,

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,820
 Tulsa, wherever you are joining us from,

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,620
 we're continuing this series of Ephesians.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,340
 I'm gonna read the passage we're gonna be in,

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,180
 and it is a prayer that comes from chapter three

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,600
 of the book of Ephesians.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,540
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,980
 And I'm gonna start in verse 14,

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,580
 where Paul lays out one of the best prayers

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,900
 in the New Testament, and he says this,

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,740
 speaking to the Ephesian church.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,420
 "For this reason," talking about the gospel

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,980
 and how it is for all people everywhere,

20
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,580
 "I kneel before the Father,

21
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,060
 "from whom every family in heaven and on earth

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,980
 "derives its name.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,260
 "I pray that out of the glorious riches,"

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,220
 out of his glorious riches,

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,540
 "he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,560
 "in your inner being,

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,760
 "so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
 "And I pray that you,

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,380
 "being rooted and established in love,

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,020
 "may have power together with all of the Lord's people,

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,540
 "to grasp how high and long

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,200
 "and high and deep is the love of Christ,

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,760
 "and to know this love that surpasses knowledge,

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,920
 "that you may be filled

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,480
 "to the measure of all fullness of God,

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,340
 "now to him who is able to do immeasurably more

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,340
 "than all we could ask or imagine,

38
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,800
 "according to his power that is at work within us,

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,100
 "to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,860
 "throughout all generations, forever and ever.

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,980
 "And all God's people said, amen."

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,560
 Hey, in the room, anybody grow up playing soccer in here?

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,720
 Yeah, there you go.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,080
 I didn't grow up playing soccer, but you get it,

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,800
 it's a ball, two goals, you figure it out.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
 And I coach my kids and my son,

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,600
 I coached his soccer team last year,

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,480
 and it was a bunch of, at the time, five-year-olds,

49
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
 and how hard could it be?

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,260
 And so day one, show up, practice, teach 'em how to do it.

51
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,560
 It's five-year-olds, they're just there

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,840
 for the Capri Sun and orange slices anyways,

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,420
 and try to teach 'em how to play soccer.

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,500
 We go out for 11 consecutive weeks,

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,520
 the same thing happens over and over and over,

56
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,040
 and that's called a loss.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,120
 A lot of teams have in history gone undefeated.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,040
 This was the first team I'd ever been a part of

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,920
 that just simply went defeated.

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,480
 And every week, we would show up and just get destroyed.

61
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,760
 And so I knew soccer season was coming back,

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,240
 coaching the team again, gonna hopefully

63
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,760
 have a better record than last year.

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,600
 And so practice has been happening the last few weeks,

65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
 getting 'em ready, trying to teach 'em,

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
 these are midfielders, and trying to teach 'em

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,480
 something about the game, and to be aggressive,

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,380
 and you're gonna take that ball down the field,

69
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,360
 don't score on our goal, score on their goal,

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,800
 and we're practicing.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
 First game came this past Saturday.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,960
 Show up, game face is ready, it's gonna be awesome.

73
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,880
 And about 32 minutes later, we had acquired another loss,

74
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,000
 seven to zero.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
 And I'm just watching these kids, and I'm like,

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,800
 man, you guys are, clearly I have failed you as a coach.

77
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,360
 I mean, this is a picture of us this Saturday

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
 out on the field, where I'm like,

79
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
 all right guys, here's the deal.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
 (audience laughing)

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,820
 I need you to stop losing, okay?

82
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,320
 Who wants to be a loser here, anybody?

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
 And that's not what I said at all.

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
 But I'm trying to go through strategy,

85
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
 I'm like, you're gonna take the ball,

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,340
 I need you to be aggressive.

87
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,100
 You throw a little elbow, that's okay.

88
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,880
 And I didn't say that, but man, I was so tempted to.

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,480
 But these are kids that just were not able to succeed,

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,760
 and candidly, they really didn't know how to.

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
 How to not just survive in the game,

92
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,560
 but really thrive, and even be any sort of competitive,

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,480
 and the loss was seven to zero,

94
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,240
 which is pretty significant among six year olds.

95
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,040
 Now, why do I start there?

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,500
 Because the Apostle Paul is going to, in this prayer,

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,160
 give us a formula, so to speak,

98
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,520
 for how to succeed in your faith,

99
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,440
 or how to not just survive, but to thrive in your faith.

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,280
 And apart from knowing that, and in life,

101
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,640
 we're all gonna have valleys, and mountaintops,

102
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,920
 or highs and lows, good times, hard times.

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,560
 He's gonna give the formula that you and I are to go back to

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,640
 and he's praying over this Ephesian church

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,160
 that no matter what they face,

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
 this should be a part of their journey

107
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,160
 so that they could not just survive,

108
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,160
 but thrive and succeed in living out their faith.

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,440
 And so we're gonna walk through,

110
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,880
 but this is gonna give an answer to

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
 a lot of some of the questions

112
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,080
 that all of us have just in life,

113
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,560
 of how do I go through life and be okay

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,600
 when things are not okay?

115
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,220
 He's gonna give some of the ingredients

116
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,660
 that make up people in the room right now,

117
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,320
 that man, you're going through trying times,

118
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,160
 but you just have like a peace about you,

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,560
 and it's because of your awareness and your practice

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,840
 of the things that Paul is saying.

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,360
 And he's recording some words that I hope

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,760
 bury into your heart for the rest of your life,

123
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,240
 because as things go well and things don't,

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,480
 it is knowing and understanding these

125
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,880
 that will allow you to be okay in that journey,

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,160
 and not just to survive, but to thrive in your faith.

127
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
 As we've said, the book of Ephesians,

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,240
 if you were joining us for the first week,

129
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,320
 about three weeks ago, we were in the book,

130
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,520
 or chapter two of Ephesians,

131
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,000
 and if you missed it, all of that's available

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,120
 on the podcast or on YouTube

133
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,220
 or anywhere that you listen to stuff.

134
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,960
 And basically, the book of Ephesians

135
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
 was a letter written to the church in Ephesus.

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,240
 Whereas Ephesus, today, it's a modern day Turkey.

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,740
 It was a coastal city, very influential city,

138
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,660
 very wealthy city, had a climate

139
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,840
 that made it something akin to LA.

140
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,920
 It was incredibly just a fluent, nice place to live,

141
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
 right on the coast.

142
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,720
 You can go visit it and get on a plane today,

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
 and there's still a large city that exists there.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
 And the apostle Paul, he loved the church in Ephesus.

145
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,600
 He spent more time there than almost any other place

146
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,160
 that he would spend time.

147
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,960
 And he's writing to this young church,

148
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,480
 and he's saying, man, hey, I am hitting my knees,

149
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,720
 praying for you, and here's what I'm praying.

150
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
 And Paul writes this from a prison cell.

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,860
 We know that it's about 60 AD, 30 years after Jesus,

152
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,100
 and Paul's sitting in a prison cell,

153
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,660
 and he's writing different letters to the churches,

154
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,500
 and he writes and says,

155
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,880
 man, this is what I am praying for you.

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,060
 And I'm gonna walk back slower, or more slowly,

157
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,540
 through verses 14 through 21,

158
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,980
 and he's coming out of the first part of chapter three,

159
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,860
 where he basically, in light of the gospel

160
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,700
 we covered in chapter two,

161
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,380
 that Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead,

162
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,860
 and anyone who accepts him as the payment for their sin,

163
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,040
 their Lord and their Savior, can have eternal life.

164
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,300
 And he, in the first part,

165
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,460
 that we're not gonna read tonight,

166
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,840
 he basically saying, hey, it's not just Jews,

167
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,220
 it's not just Gentiles, it's everybody.

168
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,880
 And he's trying to correct, or he just corrected,

169
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,160
 the flawed mentality a lot of people in that day had,

170
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,880
 that God is up in heaven going,

171
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,300
 man, I just love the Jewish people,

172
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,820
 and everybody else I'm pretty cool with,

173
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,320
 but man, at the end of the day,

174
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,300
 give me a J, give me an E, give me a W, go Jews,

175
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
 that's the team that I'm on.

176
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,560
 And Paul's saying, no, that's not, no, that's all off.

177
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
 That the message in the gospel is for all people everywhere,

178
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,700
 that Jesus paved a way and created a bridge for all people.

179
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,220
 And then he turns and he begins to pray.

180
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,140
 And so let me read the first two verses again,

181
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,100
 and I wanna highlight something that he says.

182
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,100
 For this reason, I kneel before the Father,

183
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,980
 from whom every family in heaven and on earth

184
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,500
 derives its name.

185
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,340
 He's just painting a picture

186
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,100
 of how great and grand and big God is.

187
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,380
 Every person who's ever existed,

188
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,100
 every family that's ever existed,

189
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,820
 comes from the source of life, which is God.

190
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,820
 And I pray that out of his glorious riches,

191
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,220
 he may strengthen you with power through his spirit,

192
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,940
 that his Holy Spirit would give you power

193
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,860
 in your inner being,

194
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,860
 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.

195
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,740
 That the Apostle Paul

196
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,020
 is gonna pray some interesting things.

197
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,900
 I mean, if you're Paul,

198
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,340
 and you know all the challenges they're facing in Ephesus.

199
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,580
 Ephesus is not an easy city to be a Christian.

200
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,820
 These are young believers.

201
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,860
 It's a very different day and age.

202
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,540
 All the niceties of our modern world didn't exist.

203
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,860
 And they're growing a church in a very hostile environment

204
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,200
 of all the things you could have prayed.

205
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
 I'm praying God will strengthen you

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,780
 with his spirit on the inside,

207
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,780
 and that Christ will dwell in your heart through faith.

208
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,060
 What does that mean?

209
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,860
 Well, the first thing that Paul is pointing at

210
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,940
 is I'm praying that Christ would lead you,

211
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,980
 that you would let, or the first idea,

212
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,300
 that you would be led by Christ.

213
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,660
 Now, you probably have heard that before.

214
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,060
 Here's why I say that, and here's why that matters.

215
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,100
 He just used the expression,

216
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,440
 Christ would dwell in your hearts by faith.

217
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,020
 Now, if you're like me, and you grew up in church,

218
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,420
 you may have heard the expression before,

219
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,500
 hey, boys and girls,

220
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,700
 who would like to accept Jesus into their heart?

221
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,140
 Anyone ever heard this before?

222
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,180
 Typically, it was painted like,

223
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,100
 would you like to go spend eternity in heaven

224
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,520
 with all the chocolate in the world,

225
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,860
 and your parents, and your family,

226
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,980
 or would you like to go to hell forever, huh?

227
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,500
 It was a very simple decision as a kid.

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,780
 You're like, I'm gonna go with the chocolate,

229
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,020
 even though I don't fully connect the dots

230
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,860
 on what this means.

231
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,740
 Is that what he's talking about?

232
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,960
 No.

233
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,460
 That phraseology is not even great phrasing.

234
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,020
 I get the sentiment, but that's not a biblical idea

235
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,720
 in terms of being saved,

236
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,660
 of asking Jesus into your heart

237
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,720
 as though Jesus would appear from out of nowhere

238
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,980
 and just be shrunk down, honey,

239
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,660
 I shrunk the kid style, and go right into your heart.

240
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,740
 That's not a biblical idea.

241
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,300
 But this phrase that he's talking about

242
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,460
 is not about salvation.

243
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,780
 He's saying, I'm asking that Christ would come

244
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,620
 make his home, and his spirit would set up shop

245
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,940
 in your heart through faith.

246
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,480
 What is he saying?

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,520
 He's praying, hey, that you would be led

248
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,420
 by Christ, here's why I mean that.

249
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,860
 When you think about the heart,

250
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,420
 and the Bible says, loving the Lord your God

251
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,860
 with all of your heart.

252
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,540
 It says that you need to protect your heart

253
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
 'cause everything you do, the Proverbs say,

254
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,060
 flows from your heart.

255
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,700
 What is it saying?

256
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,360
 Well, you probably haven't thought about this,

257
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,140
 but it's not saying your physical heart.

258
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,180
 In other words, when you hear that,

259
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,740
 you understand it's a metaphor.

260
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,120
 The heart means something in the Bible.

261
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,120
 It is a word that is an attempt to describe

262
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,080
 the control center of your life.

263
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,100
 That would be your emotions, your feelings,

264
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,380
 your decision making, your will, your personality,

265
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,700
 all of that would be your heart.

266
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,500
 In other words, we understand when somebody says,

267
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,620
 man, I'll give you my heart, they're not saying

268
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,180
 they wanna sign up to be a transplant donor to you.

269
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,660
 They're saying in dating context, man, I love you.

270
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,180
 'Cause we understand it represents the control center

271
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,940
 of their life, their feelings.

272
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,500
 And Paul is saying, hey, here's what I'm praying for you.

273
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,740
 I'm praying that you would be led by Christ,

274
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,080
 and you would allow him to make his dwelling

275
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 or to make a home inside of the control center of your life.

276
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,480
 You would allow him to come in and inform how you date,

277
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,060
 how you think, how you spend, how you work.

278
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,180
 There would be no competition for, hey, God, you come in,

279
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,820
 you are leading my life.

280
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,940
 I'm gonna trust you, you come make your home.

281
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,980
 And the language he uses is to dwell or to make a home.

282
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,700
 When I got married to my wife, we moved in together,

283
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,520
 which I would highly recommend when you get married.

284
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 And things very quickly began to change for me.

285
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,780
 Here's what I mean.

286
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,700
 I just mean like my environment, like where I existed,

287
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,220
 dramatically changed overnight.

288
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,620
 I was a single guy, I just didn't have a lot of stuff.

289
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,460
 I slept on a futon every night.

290
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,020
 All I owned was some books, clothes, and like,

291
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
 I don't even know that I owned anything else

292
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,600
 other than the futon, than that.

293
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
 Then we got married, and all of a sudden, slowly over time,

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,820
 as you had this relationship came in,

295
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,860
 she began to redecorate everything.

296
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,180
 And so the futon, it's gone.

297
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,260
 Clothing stuff begins to appear on the walls.

298
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,040
 Guys don't decorate and put things on the walls,

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,060
 or at least I didn't.

300
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,920
 And you know, pillows, they begin to bring in

301
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,340
 truckloads of pillows and rugs.

302
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,980
 Rugs, we put rugs.

303
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,000
 I don't know why you need rugs,

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,060
 but they would just show up and they were everywhere.

305
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,840
 And she began to, one by one, over time,

306
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,420
 just begin to redecorate the home.

307
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,340
 As she made it a home, she was going to bring

308
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,700
 some redecorating.

309
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,740
 And Paul is saying, hey, I'm praying

310
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,460
 that you will trust Jesus.

311
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,700
 That's what word by faith means.

312
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,420
 And you would allow Jesus to come into your life

313
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,060
 and to redecorate your home.

314
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,260
 And he's gonna show up and he's gonna begin to say,

315
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,740
 hey, I'm gonna begin to change some things in here.

316
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,220
 And the old way you used to date,

317
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,280
 and the old way you used to live,

318
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,420
 and the old way you used to spend,

319
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,500
 and the old way you used to talk,

320
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,220
 and the old way you used to think about forgiving people,

321
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,060
 or relationships and hurts,

322
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,980
 I'm gonna begin to change and redecorate.

323
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,600
 And Paul is saying, when that begins to happen,

324
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,280
 I'm praying that you will trust him and follow him.

325
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,480
 That you would be willing to be led by Jesus

326
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
 as it relates to all of your life.

327
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
 I mean, candidly, this is why some of you guys,

328
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,820
 you've seen this begin to happen firsthand.

329
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,240
 Like you trusted in Jesus,

330
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,000
 and all of a sudden things began to change.

331
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,480
 And it wasn't because somebody stood up here

332
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
 and gave you a 10 list, you know, do this, X,

333
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
 do this, X, do this.

334
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,260
 You just began to follow Jesus.

335
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,060
 You began to live in community with other believers,

336
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,100
 and he just began to change how you think

337
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,280
 about dating relationships.

338
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
 How you think about the opposite sex.

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
 How you think about your job.

340
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,000
 How you think about life.

341
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,180
 He began to like lead you to forgive

342
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,860
 that parents who really hurt you.

343
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,600
 And it was because he began to come in

344
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,680
 and make his home in your heart and begin to change.

345
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,000
 That you begin to go, man, I've never dated a guy actually,

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
 like in kept physical boundaries,

347
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,160
 but I began to actually follow Jesus.

348
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,580
 And now I'm going, hey, I wanna prioritize pursuing purity.

349
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,900
 Because Jesus has made his home

350
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,020
 in your control center of your life.

351
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,220
 And you've trusted him.

352
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,320
 And Paul's saying, man, I'm praying that you will continue

353
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,680
 to be led and trust him.

354
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,500
 And that you would be strengthened from within

355
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,960
 to follow his lead.

356
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,080
 That you would let him drive.

357
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,340
 And then he gives a second prayer.

358
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,000
 And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,

359
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,480
 may have power together with all of the Lord's people

360
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,400
 to grasp how high, how wide, how long, how high,

361
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,900
 and how deep is the love of Christ.

362
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,820
 And to know this love that surpasses knowledge.

363
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,480
 Paul is writing all of this.

364
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,500
 He's hitting his knees on the floor of a prison cell.

365
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,560
 Saying, man, I'm praying that you will allow Christ

366
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,400
 to lead your life.

367
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,280
 And I'm praying that supernaturally God will allow you

368
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,320
 to know how deeply loved you are.

369
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,440
 And that love would anchor you or root you

370
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,180
 or give you security.

371
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,080
 When's the last time you heard anybody

372
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,700
 pray anything like that?

373
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,400
 I mean, if we're honest, just most of our prayers,

374
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
 it's like, God, will you help me get the raise?

375
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,840
 Will you help me to get to work on time?

376
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,860
 Will you help me to hit the green light?

377
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,400
 Will you help me to heal somebody that I know?

378
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,000
 And out of everything Paul could pray for,

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,880
 he's saying, and I am begging God

380
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,720
 to help you be rooted in his love.

381
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,440
 That you would have a foundation that is strong and secure

382
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,400
 because you understand how deeply loved you are by God.

383
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,560
 The second idea from the text is that Paul prays

384
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,700
 that we would be secure in Christ's love.

385
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,560
 That you would have security that comes

386
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,640
 from an awareness of God's love for you.

387
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,240
 The picture of being rooted is a picture for plants,

388
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,840
 that a tree, the deeper its roots go into the soil,

389
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,840
 the more stable and secure it is.

390
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,280
 And Paul says, if you wanna have more stability,

391
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,800
 more security, you wanna experience growth in your life,

392
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,240
 it comes from you having roots that go deep

393
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,400
 into understanding God's love for you.

394
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,480
 It doesn't come from understanding more Bible verses,

395
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
 which is a good thing.

396
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,800
 Doesn't come from attending more church services,

397
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,840
 which is a good thing.

398
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,240
 Doesn't come from memorizing a certain number of passages.

399
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,320
 He says, I'm praying, all those things are great.

400
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,360
 But you would be rooted in an awareness

401
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,600
 of how deeply loved you are.

402
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,280
 Here's why I think this is such an important thing,

403
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,880
 and we can quickly dismiss and be like,

404
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,520
 yeah, he loves me, he loves the whole world.

405
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,080
 But why it really matters,

406
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,880
 your perspective on God's love for you right now,

407
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,720
 where you are, sitting here, listening online,

408
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,760
 joining in another location,

409
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,280
 is gonna determine when you inevitably fail God,

410
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,840
 and you do the thing you promised you would never do again,

411
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,040
 you guys cross the physical boundary again,

412
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,760
 you look at pornography again,

413
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,840
 you end up drinking too much at the happy hour

414
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,120
 and you promised and you were done,

415
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,560
 whenever that happens,

416
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,720
 and whatever that looks like,

417
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,280
 your perspective on whether God and his perspective on you

418
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,600
 and his love for you has changed or not

419
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,680
 is going to determine whether in those moments

420
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,360
 you're gonna run from God or you run towards him.

421
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,520
 That without a death grip on man, I am loved.

422
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,800
 I have a strong foundation,

423
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,240
 and it doesn't come from my behavior,

424
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,640
 it comes from an awareness that I am loved

425
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,960
 is what allows you to run towards God

426
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,400
 when those moments of failure happen.

427
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
 There's actually a real life example of this in the Bible.

428
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,160
 The apostle John was unique in a lot of respects,

429
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,360
 and apostle John was one of the 12 disciples.

430
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 So Jesus on the planet has these 12 guys,

431
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,720
 one of them named John, one of Jesus's best friends.

432
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,840
 And Jesus on the night before he's crucified

433
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,920
 is betrayed by Peter,

434
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,400
 and then he's abandoned by all 12 disciples.

435
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,600
 Jesus even predicted,

436
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,200
 "Hey guys, I'm gonna get arrested soon.

437
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,720
 "All of you guys are gonna scatter.

438
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,800
 "You're not even gonna act like you know me,

439
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 "and you're all gonna abandon me in my worst moment."

440
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,000
 And all the disciples are listening,

441
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
 and they're like, "No, not me, not me.

442
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,520
 "I'll be willing to die for you."

443
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,000
 And just as Jesus said a few hours later, he's arrested.

444
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,920
 He's led away to be crucified,

445
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,200
 and all of them scatter, all of them run,

446
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,280
 all of them abandon him.

447
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,280
 And the next day, he's led out to be crucified.

448
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,120
 And we're told of only one disciple

449
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,280
 who shows up at the cross, John.

450
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,440
 All the other ones had abandoned him,

451
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,740
 and there's no mention or reference to them.

452
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:25,440
 But John, despite having abandoned him 12 hours earlier,

453
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,120
 feels as though he can still approach Jesus,

454
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,000
 the guy that he had promised, "I'll never abandon you."

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,640
 Why did he have that ability?

456
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,760
 Why would he be the only one

457
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,240
 that is referenced as showing up at the cross?

458
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,720
 Well, he's not just unique

459
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
 in that he's the only one mentioned.

460
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,180
 He's unique in that he had a unique nickname

461
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,720
 that he had given himself.

462
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,520
 And I think this nickname reflected a perspective

463
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,600
 that he had that allowed him, despite having failed,

464
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 "I know that I can approach Jesus."

465
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,920
 And his nickname was this, five times in his own gospel,

466
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,680
 he refers to himself every time the same way.

467
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,480
 "The disciple whom Jesus loved."

468
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,640
 Which is a funny way of putting it.

469
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,060
 I mean, if you're the other disciples,

470
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,360
 every time John refers to himself,

471
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,880
 he's like, "Peter was there, Andrew,

472
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,340
 "and the disciple whom Jesus loved."

473
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,600
 I mean, if you're the other guys, you're reading,

474
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,480
 you're like, "Take it easy, John, he loved all of us."

475
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,320
 But John's like, so caught up in his identity

476
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,600
 coming from God's and Jesus's love for him.

477
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,880
 I mean, I want you to think about that.

478
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,780
 In other words, his identity wasn't informed

479
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,040
 by how much he loved Jesus.

480
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,760
 It was informed by how much Jesus loved him.

481
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,780
 And it is that that allowed him,

482
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,560
 even after failing like all the other guys,

483
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,040
 he distinctly comes to the cross

484
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,680
 and approaches despite having failed Jesus.

485
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,720
 Because he saw himself as,

486
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
 "My identity doesn't come from what I've done, what I do,

487
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,240
 "or even how much I love Jesus.

488
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,980
 "It comes from how much Jesus loves me."

489
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,180
 And it is having that grip that Paul is saying,

490
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,680
 "Man, I'm praying above everything I could pray,

491
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,340
 "I pray that you would have an awareness

492
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,920
 "of how deeply loved you are."

493
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,820
 I know that in my own perspective,

494
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,520
 I probably have a flawed at best understanding

495
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,980
 because Paul says, "Man, this is going to give you stability

496
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,060
 "and continue to grow you and anchor you in your faith

497
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,800
 "so you know how loved you are."

498
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,300
 So many of the problems in our world,

499
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,420
 and candidly, in a lot of our lives,

500
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,760
 can be traced to seeking and desiring to feel,

501
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,160
 or want to feel loved.

502
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,700
 And Paul is saying, "I'm praying you wouldn't seek that

503
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,300
 "other places, you would know how loved you are."

504
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,260
 Why do I say problems?

505
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,900
 I was reading this past week a book by Patrick Carnes,

506
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,340
 who's one of the leading psychologists of today,

507
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,660
 particularly in the realm of addiction.

508
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,300
 And he's not a believer, but he writes,

509
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,900
 and he's an award-winning psychologist

510
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,220
 on behavioral patterns and addiction.

511
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,080
 And he wrote something in one of his books

512
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,560
 called Out of the Shadows about his conclusion

513
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,600
 about what fuels a lot of addiction.

514
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
 And it was a pretty fascinating thing.

515
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,080
 He said, "At the heart of addict behavior,

516
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,480
 "it's fueled by believing they are unlovable

517
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,400
 "and/or unloved."

518
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,180
 So many of the issues that people wrestle with

519
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,340
 can be traced to this emptiness, this feeling like,

520
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,060
 man, I don't know that I am worth loving.

521
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,980
 And Paul's saying, "I pray that you would have a flood

522
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,280
 "of understanding of how loved that you are."

523
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,860
 Kesha did an interview with The Rolling Stone,

524
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,620
 feels like a curveball, but,

525
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,020
 (audience laughing)

526
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,300
 in it, she said something that was interesting.

527
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,880
 For a girl who has everything, she has beauty,

528
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 she has fame, she has money, she has success,

529
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,500
 she's brilliant, and in it, she said,

530
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,980
 "I'm a crusader for being yourself and loving yourself,

531
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,260
 "but I found it very hard to practice.

532
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,280
 "I'll be unavailable for the next season

533
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,740
 "seeking treatment for an eating disorder."

534
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:19,600
 But she's going, "I am finding it difficult

535
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,340
 "to find myself worth loving."

536
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,740
 And the challenge of her saying,

537
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,220
 "Man, I can't love myself,"

538
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,220
 is ultimately, if your focus is self-love,

539
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,980
 the focus of your love is self.

540
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,120
 And Paul says, "Man, I'm praying that you'll have

541
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,820
 "a death grip on the fact that you,

542
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,340
 "no matter what you do for the rest of your life,

543
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,860
 "no matter how many times you fail,

544
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,240
 "you are loved by God, and that will anchor you,

545
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,660
 "because it's gonna shape you, and it's gonna shape me."

546
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,620
 And he's saying, "Man, I'm praying that you

547
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,380
 "would be secure in Christ's love."

548
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,140
 So many of the dating relationships in the room,

549
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,740
 candidly, are driven by the fact

550
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,820
 that you don't think that you're worthy or valuable,

551
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,580
 or you think of yourself as damaged goods,

552
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,980
 so you lower your standards,

553
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,860
 or you think that no one will ever wanna date

554
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,300
 somebody like you, so you turn to pornography.

555
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,740
 One of the top reasons people turn to pornography

556
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,500
 is a desire to feel desired.

557
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,200
 And Paul, it makes sense when you begin to see

558
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,020
 all the different ways it plays out inside of our life.

559
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,420
 I mean, how much just the fear of how we look

560
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,300
 makes us, or wanting to be loved

561
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,700
 makes us stress certain ways,

562
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,220
 and something tighter, and something that goes lower,

563
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,900
 or comes up higher.

564
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,700
 It's no wonder plastic surgery is at an all-time high.

565
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,540
 People chasing the desire to feel accepted,

566
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,480
 to feel loved, to feel affirmed.

567
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,800
 And Paul says, "Man, there's a love that I'm begging God

568
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,380
 "to give you supernatural ability to see."

569
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,260
 And he says, "It's four-dimensional.

570
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,400
 "It's wide enough for all of mankind.

571
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,860
 "It is a love that is greater

572
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,580
 "than anything you would understand.

573
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,720
 "It is deeper, and deep enough to reach

574
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,520
 "into the darkest sinner's heart.

575
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,160
 "It is long enough to scale, and will scale eternity.

576
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,880
 "It is high enough to bring all things

577
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,120
 "into the heavenly places,

578
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,460
 "and I'm praying for you to know it."

579
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,260
 And he says something so interesting.

580
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,260
 He says, "I'm praying you will know the love of God

581
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,920
 "that surpasses knowledge.

582
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,820
 "I'm praying this love that is so grand, so high,

583
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,500
 "so large, so wide, so incredible, four dimensions,

584
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,860
 "I'm praying and asking God for you to know it,

585
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,600
 "because it surpasses knowledge,

586
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,840
 "for you to experience it."

587
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,680
 He gives four dimensions.

588
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,560
 If you've heard of 4D movies before,

589
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,080
 there's something, for those of us, or if you haven't,

590
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,180
 I went to a 4D movie about a year ago

591
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,920
 with one of my kids at this movie theater,

592
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,280
 and in the movie theater, what makes it 4D,

593
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,920
 if you haven't been to one, is it takes 3D,

594
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,400
 we have the glasses, and then it adds physical elements

595
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,220
 so you have another dimension and you experience it.

596
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,360
 In other words, when I was at,

597
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,040
 put on the glasses, watching some Lego movie,

598
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,520
 and all of a sudden, you're seeing everything in 3D,

599
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,880
 but then snow, fake snow begins to fall,

600
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,120
 and fake wind begins to blow, and fake rain begins to fall.

601
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,480
 The difference between the 3D and the 4D is you feel it,

602
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
 you experience it, and Paul's saying,

603
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,200
 "Man, I'm praying that God would allow you

604
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,060
 "a 4D understanding of his love,

605
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 "that you would experience it,

606
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,780
 "that it would begin to rush into your life."

607
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,640
 'Cause here's what I just know, at least for me,

608
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,940
 and I think for a lot of Christians,

609
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,180
 when we think of the love of God,

610
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,660
 we're like, "Man, that's so sweet, and that's great,

611
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,900
 "and yeah, that's awesome, and you know,

612
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,560
 "he's a loving God, and it's great."

613
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,400
 And Paul is saying, "This is the thing

614
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,040
 "that changes everything.

615
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,200
 "It's immeasurable, other than when you look at the cross.

616
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,100
 "It's the only measuring unit that we have,

617
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,200
 "depicts God's love of giving his own son on the cross

618
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,460
 "for you and me, that there's no length I could go

619
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,000
 "that would be greater."

620
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,180
 And he's saying, "Man, I'm praying that it would

621
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,920
 "have a death grip in your life."

622
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,140
 Here's what I mean when we kinda underplay.

623
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,160
 It's almost like we think of God's love,

624
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,200
 and it's like we think of the difference

625
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,500
 between sprinkling outside and a hurricane.

626
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,920
 When the Bible describes his love,

627
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,780
 it's like it is like nothing,

628
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,780
 it's like a hurricane flood of rushing waters.

629
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,480
 And I think a lot of times we think of it as like,

630
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,280
 it's kinda raining, like we go outside,

631
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,980
 and it's like, "Oh, it's kinda sprinkling.

632
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,080
 "There's a little sprinkle over here,

633
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,000
 "and there's some little rain over here."

634
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,820
 And Paul is saying, "It's like a hurricane of (blows)

635
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,740
 "and I'm praying that it would fall on you,

636
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,380
 "and you would understand it,

637
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,000
 "and that would impact the rest of your life."

638
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,160
 And then, after moving into being secure in his love,

639
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,860
 he says, "That you may be filled

640
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:57,380
 "to the measure of all the fullness of God."

641
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,560
 He uses plan words in the Greek,

642
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,400
 which was the original language, and he's saying,

643
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,500
 "I'm praying that you would be full

644
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,740
 "and experience some of the fullness of God."

645
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,580
 And this prayer includes,

646
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,280
 "Hey, I'm praying you'd be led by Christ,

647
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,780
 "you would be secure in the love of Christ,

648
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,680
 "and that you would find satisfaction,"

649
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,100
 or point three, "be satisfied in Christ."

650
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,780
 The same word in Greek for satisfied is filled.

651
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,880
 He says, "I'm praying you'd be filled.

652
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,140
 "I'm praying you'd be satisfied.

653
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,180
 "I'm praying that you would not look to other things

654
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,260
 "that cannot fulfill what only Christ can,

655
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,740
 "that you wouldn't look to a job,

656
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,940
 "you wouldn't look to a paycheck,

657
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,360
 "you wouldn't look to some future day

658
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,020
 "where you're married and everything's pretty

659
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,340
 "and you've got all the different dreams

660
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
 "and hopes that you have, and believe the lie

661
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,660
 "that, hey, once I'm there, then I'll be satisfied,

662
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,900
 "that you would know there is only one source."

663
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,500
 And the reason this is important is if you operate

664
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,260
 and seek to be satisfied or seek and look

665
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,500
 to other things around you in the world,

666
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,780
 they're going to leave you empty.

667
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,100
 And he's saying, "Man, I'm praying that you would be filled

668
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,700
 "and know where you can experience being filled

669
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
 "at a soul level."

670
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,200
 Whenever I go shopping, which is not often,

671
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,920
 but I've done it before, and especially grocery shopping,

672
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,800
 I can't go grocery shopping if I'm hungry

673
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,160
 because what happens?

674
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,000
 We've all been there before.

675
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,640
 You end up being like, "Oh, look, Tostitos has another new,

676
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,300
 "I've never even seen this flavor before.

677
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,700
 "It's on sale, and let's get it."

678
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,720
 And you end up buying all these different things

679
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
 that you don't need and you're eating in the car

680
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,080
 on the way home just 'cause you haven't eaten.

681
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,560
 And I think Paul is saying, "Man, I'm hoping you don't go

682
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,140
 "through life making decisions,

683
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,660
 "living from a place where because of an emptiness

684
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,640
 "inside of you, you seek to fill it

685
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,100
 "with things that can never provide lasting satisfaction,

686
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,020
 "that you would be satisfied and you would experience that

687
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,420
 "at the only place where it is available,

688
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,160
 "which is in Christ."

689
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,960
 What's interesting in today's age is we look at Hollywood,

690
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,820
 and you look at all the successful music artists,

691
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,500
 you look at people that have everything that everybody wants.

692
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,980
 And in particular in the music industry,

693
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,100
 it's a really fascinating one because we have a firsthand

694
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,600
 look into some of the music they write

695
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,100
 and some of the lyrics that they put out,

696
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,700
 and these are men and women who have everything.

697
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,500
 I mean, they have a house, they have the cars,

698
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,880
 they have the lifestyle the world wants,

699
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,260
 and yet they write lyrics every now and then

700
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,180
 that just sleep out or just pop out there,

701
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,900
 and they're not the off the wall to the window,

702
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,340
 but they actually have meaning.

703
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,680
 And you go, "Wow, you're really lonely."

704
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,380
 What are some examples of what I mean by that?

705
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,700
 People that despite having everything the world says

706
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,240
 would satisfy go, "I feel empty."

707
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,500
 Olivia Rodrigo has a song called Jealousy Jealousy.

708
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,840
 Just listen to these lyrics.

709
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,380
 And this is someone who by the world standards

710
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,880
 is famous, beautiful, popular,

711
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,600
 and she writes, "I want to be you so bad

712
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,680
 "and I don't even know you.

713
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,520
 "All I see is what I should be, happier, prettier.

714
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,680
 "I'm so sick of myself, I'd rather be anyone, anyone else."

715
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,980
 Juice WRLD, who sadly passed away

716
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,300
 because of his battle with depression

717
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,780
 and battle with being unable to feel something

718
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,280
 that only Christ can, in one of his songs, Wishing Well,

719
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,720
 "Ring, ring, phone call from depression.

720
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,380
 "On the other line, I talk to addiction.

721
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,700
 "Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them.

722
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,860
 "Something feels broke on the inside, need to fix it."

723
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,740
 I mean, even Stressed Out, which is like one of the

724
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,280
 more popular songs of the last couple years by 21 Pilots.

725
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,580
 Listen, I mean, and they all got tunes,

726
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
 and so until you stop and you're like,

727
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,840
 "Wow, you are really lonely, you need Jesus."

728
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,580
 You're just kind of nodding your head along,

729
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,540
 listening to it on the radio,

730
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,660
 but listen to part of the lyrics in there.

731
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,820
 "I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink.

732
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:19,880
 "But now I am, I'm insecure, I care what people think.

733
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,840
 "Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

734
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,000
 "when mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out."

735
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,200
 Even Bieber, describing all the wild success he had,

736
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,620
 "What if you had it all, but no one to call?

737
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,180
 "Maybe then you'd know me, 'cause I've had everything,

738
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,020
 "but no one's listening, and that's just so lonely.

739
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
 "I'm so lonely, lonely."

740
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,200
 Now, this have great beats,

741
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,600
 and a lot of us are very familiar with them.

742
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,100
 But when you stop and you go,

743
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,300
 their description of a life

744
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,680
 that has everything the world says matters,

745
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,260
 they're describing.

746
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,660
 The world has sold a lie,

747
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,600
 and none of this stuff satisfies,

748
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,100
 because it doesn't, and there's only one place

749
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,960
 that you and I can find satisfaction,

750
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,280
 that there's no relationship, there's no salary.

751
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,160
 Whatever you make right now, if you doubled it,

752
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,600
 it wouldn't be enough.

753
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,940
 Whatever your relational status is,

754
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,080
 if you had fill in the blank of what you wanted,

755
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,840
 it would still not be enough apart from Christ.

756
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,120
 And Paul's saying, "I'm praying you would know

757
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,880
 "how loved you are, you would have a security.

758
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,080
 "You're not gonna look at the world

759
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,560
 "and try to fix it by everybody else,

760
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,460
 "or try to fix it by the next thing,

761
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,300
 "or the next relationship, or the next job,

762
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,380
 "or the next purchase.

763
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,520
 "I'm gonna find it in the only place I can,

764
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,780
 "which for the rest of your life

765
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,720
 "is in a relationship with Jesus."

766
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,800
 And Paul says, "Man, I'm praying that you would be filled

767
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,120
 "by the fullness of God.

768
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,760
 "The fullness of God is more than enough

769
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,160
 "to fill every single human soul and human heart

770
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,040
 "that's ever existed."

771
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,320
 And he's saying, "You would experience the fullness

772
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,640
 "that is far more than enough."

773
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,800
 It's like this, this is an empty water bottle.

774
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,840
 He's saying, "I'm praying that you would know

775
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
 "that there is far more than enough,

776
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
 "and you would go deep into knowing the character

777
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,100
 "and the love of God, and you would experience

778
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,880
 "that it is more than enough,

779
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,420
 "that you would be surrounded by his love,

780
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,900
 "you would be filled by his love,

781
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,120
 "and you would experience a fullness that comes

782
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,380
 "only from knowing Christ."

783
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:27,180
 You can golf clap or not, I don't care.

784
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,640
 (audience laughs)

785
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,340
 And I'm gonna transition here, but listen to me very clearly.

786
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,800
 I know I can talk up here like this for 30 minutes,

787
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,120
 I can show you an illustration, I can do all of that,

788
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,700
 and sadly, a lot of you don't believe me.

789
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,380
 And you can hear it, and you're taking notes,

790
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,580
 and you may be even saying, "Golf clap," and that's good,

791
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,660
 but you live a life that reflects the fact

792
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:54,420
 that you actually think if he would just call you back,

793
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,300
 you'd be okay.

794
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,740
 You actually think if you would have just gotten

795
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,500
 into that certain school, then, oh man,

796
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,420
 life would have been so much better, and what if?

797
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,360
 And you have bought a lie,

798
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,000
 'cause that's the way it can play at us.

799
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,780
 Like, we can buy into this mentality that,

800
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,860
 "Oh man, if only I had,

801
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,460
 "then I would have been so much more satisfied."

802
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,400
 Or, if only someday, and Paul is saying,

803
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,580
 "I'm praying you would live from a fullness that comes,

804
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,400
 "and there's only one place where it comes,

805
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,680
 "and I'm praying God will give you the supernatural strength."

806
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,120
 That's why he starts on the inside.

807
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,320
 That's why he starts saying, "I'm praying God

808
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,760
 "will give you power, the power that raised Christ

809
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,440
 "from the dead now indwells you.

810
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,960
 "You have the spirit of God, and I'm praying

811
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,900
 "he will allow you to know his love that would secure you,

812
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,740
 "and you would experience soul satisfaction,

813
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,280
 "and for the rest of your life, for the rest of my life,

814
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,080
 "if you wanna experience satisfaction,

815
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,740
 "it's not gonna come through any

816
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,260
 "of the different things that I've listed out.

817
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,860
 "There is only one place,

818
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,840
 "and if you just forget everything I'm saying,

819
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,600
 "and in six years from now, you walk out of the church today

820
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,520
 "and you don't come back for another decade,

821
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,980
 "and you come back, the message will be the same.

822
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,500
 "There is only one place and one person

823
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,120
 "that can give you satisfaction, and it's Jesus."

824
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,560
 And so, of course, Paul's going, "Man,

825
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,180
 "I get on my knees, Ephesian Church.

826
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,320
 "Yeah, I know everything you're facing,

827
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,720
 "all the persecution you're facing.

828
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,580
 "I'm sitting in a prison cell, and I am praying.

829
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,420
 "I'm praying out prayers.

830
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,360
 "You've never heard anybody pray like this.

831
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,400
 "I'm praying God will let you be anchored in his love.

832
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,940
 "Really, Paul, you just pray for me to get a raise?

833
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,760
 "I've been making $20 an hour for the last four years."

834
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,280
 And Paul's going, "The thing you need more

835
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,440
 "than any of the things that you think that you need

836
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,380
 "is a deeper understanding of God's tsunami of love for you,

837
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,080
 "displayed perfectly on the cross,

838
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,440
 "to be led by his Spirit, and Jesus, to come in,

839
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,680
 "and when he begins to redecorate, you trust him,

840
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,560
 "and you say, 'God, I'm doing it your way.

841
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,820
 "'We're not keeping my furniture.'

842
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,160
 "You move in, you take over, you take the wheel,

843
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,160
 "and for you to look to the only one that can satisfy,

844
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,400
 "which is him."

845
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,820
 It's a pretty powerful prayer.

846
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,800
 And I wanna transition, and I wanna bring up

847
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,720
 a brother in Christ who has embodied for years,

848
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,780
 and is embodying even right now what it looks like

849
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,780
 to say, "Jesus, I want you above anything else.

850
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,500
 "I want more of you, and I wanna treasure more of you.

851
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,860
 "And so any way that I can do that, I wanna do."

852
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,040
 And so will you help welcome JD up here?

853
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 (audience applauds)

854
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:38,460
 - All right, what's up, everyone?

855
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,100
 If we haven't met, my name is JD,

856
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,560
 and I have worked here at The Porch for the last,

857
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,160
 going on a little over three years.

858
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,840
 And if you've been around here, you might have noticed

859
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,540
 that through Awakened and different things,

860
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,420
 I have been absent for the last about six or seven weeks.

861
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,960
 If you haven't noticed, this is your first time here,

862
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,760
 and you're going, "I have no idea who this guy is.

863
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,480
 "Welcome to kind of like an awkward family meeting."

864
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,180
 But if you know, you know.

865
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,020
 Man.

866
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,200
 I knew that word tonight.

867
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,940
 I knew that reminder.

868
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,340
 I wanna let you guys in on just some stuff

869
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,680
 going on in my life.

870
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,940
 When I moved here three years ago,

871
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,600
 I moved from College Station, Texas,

872
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,760
 and had no idea what God had in store.

873
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,180
 I came here to do the Watermark Institute

874
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,480
 to be a student of his word.

875
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,560
 I was on the production team here at The Porch.

876
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,480
 And next thing I know, in a matter of months,

877
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,320
 I became a teacher of God's word for the first time.

878
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,340
 And throughout the three years of teaching here,

879
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,180
 which has been such a joy, I don't know when it began.

880
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,000
 I don't know how exactly it began.

881
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,520
 But I have found myself, just like you guys,

882
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,460
 I've said that from day one, I'm no different than you,

883
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,620
 but I have found myself at 29, 28, 27,

884
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,080
 sitting way too much in the seat of being a minister

885
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,800
 and not being ministered to.

886
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,620
 I found myself in the seat of being asked questions

887
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,360
 by people and being looked to to have answers

888
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,400
 and not sitting in the seat of asking more questions.

889
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,280
 I found myself somewhere along the way

890
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,180
 getting caught up in believing the lie

891
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,340
 that because I'm doing right things,

892
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,460
 that means that I am operating in right living.

893
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,420
 And somewhere along the way, as you'll hear,

894
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,200
 I've woken up to the reality that

895
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,140
 my life has gone from doing right things

896
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,220
 and I've missed the real thing in a relationship with Jesus.

897
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,720
 And where that came to be is I found myself

898
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,440
 as it kind of seemed like I was operating in this mentality

899
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,560
 of needing to have the answers, being looked to as a leader

900
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,480
 and thinking that, man, I need to carry

901
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,440
 these burdens and this weight

902
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,180
 just somewhere deep in my subconscious.

903
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,220
 I found myself running at times to safe people,

904
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,140
 my people, safe places,

905
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,980
 and what that actually ended up looking like

906
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,620
 at the beginning of August is my birthday.

907
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,340
 And me and some friends, some dear friends,

908
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,360
 some close friends and some family

909
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,700
 went on a beach trip to celebrate.

910
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,540
 And during that week, not only is it my birthday,

911
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,700
 but it's also my dad, my best friend's death anniversary.

912
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,460
 And it had been seven years,

913
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,340
 and that night I found myself upset.

914
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,400
 I found myself anxious.

915
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,240
 I found myself frustrated with God.

916
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,320
 And honestly, I found myself just wanting to be human,

917
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,160
 to be mad.

918
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,800
 And so in that mindset of wanting to run to a safe place,

919
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,680
 wanting to be off for a night,

920
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,700
 I chose to make compromising decisions around alcohol.

921
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,420
 And just frankly, I drank too much.

922
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,760
 And being in a public place,

923
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,500
 drinking too much as a pastor,

924
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,760
 it's not becoming of a leader that you deserve.

925
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,840
 And I put my wife, I put my friends in a position

926
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,140
 that they should never have to be in as a leader.

927
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,720
 I was not operating as a leader.

928
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,680
 And I take full responsibility for my actions.

929
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,460
 And I just want to say it was sin.

930
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,140
 I sinned before God, my people,

931
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,060
 and I sinned against you, and I'm sorry.

932
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,680
 After getting back from the trip,

933
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,940
 I immediately confessed to people around me,

934
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,900
 and then I confessed to leaders here at Watermark,

935
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,980
 all that took place, and they have responded with care,

936
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,800
 with correction, and with grace.

937
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,700
 And they have walked with me so well

938
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,780
 in this really just revealing season.

939
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,640
 Before what I'm about to say,

940
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
 what I don't want this to seem like

941
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,140
 is the young guy made a mistake one night,

942
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,360
 and now he's having to get up here and do this

943
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,240
 because what I've had to come personally to realize

944
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,160
 is that you don't just get to a place

945
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
 of making a mistake like this

946
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,320
 as a pastor and as a leader overnight.

947
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,760
 That this outward expression of all the inward reality

948
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,340
 and feeling, it was a drift.

949
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,500
 It was something in my heart that took place over time.

950
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,420
 And so I have spent the last six weeks,

951
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,440
 I'm gonna continue to spend as long as it takes,

952
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,000
 just like it was a drift to run away from God

953
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,400
 in the midst of all of the things I was feeling,

954
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,440
 it's gonna be a drift to run back to God.

955
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,340
 It's gonna take time, it's gonna take a season

956
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,560
 to get back to the place that I wanna be,

957
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,200
 the place of health that I wanna be with God,

958
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,020
 because what you guys deserve is a person up here

959
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,600
 that you can trust.

960
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,660
 That if I'm gonna call you to believe

961
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,680
 that God is enough, that in Him is the fullness

962
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,360
 of satisfaction, that when you're anxious,

963
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,280
 when you're sad, when you're lonely,

964
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,600
 if I'm gonna call you to run to Him

965
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,900
 and not to the things of the world,

966
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,480
 I have to practice that myself.

967
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,780
 And I am frustrated, sometimes I'm embarrassed.

968
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,120
 The enemy has tried to condemn me,

969
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,760
 but I do believe that there is therefore now no condemnation

970
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,860
 for those who are in Christ Jesus.

971
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,020
 (audience applauding)

972
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,360
 And I want you to know that God in this six weeks

973
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,720
 has already redeemed so much, and He has revealed so much,

974
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,400
 and I am so thankful.

975
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,280
 This is only God, only God can take these moments

976
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
 and bring beauty from ashes, and He's doing it.

977
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,200
 And I am falling deeply in love with Jesus again.

978
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,700
 And when I started doing this, thank you.

979
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,180
 When I started doing this, I always said,

980
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,720
 "Man, I just wanna make sure that things stay

981
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,660
 "in the right order.

982
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,340
 "I don't want anything to be outwardly

983
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:33,200
 "if it's not real inwardly."

984
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,960
 And I was blind for a season, and this woke me up.

985
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,240
 And I don't wanna be blind.

986
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,080
 The reality is, is a lot of people in these positions,

987
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,560
 guys, pray for leaders in these positions.

988
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,480
 It is hard.

989
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,800
 But the reality is, a lot of people end up

990
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,320
 in a really, really, really bad place

991
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,400
 because in these moments, in these warning signs,

992
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,540
 they didn't run to God.

993
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,560
 They kept running, they kept hiding, they kept managing.

994
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,580
 And it's just not worth it.

995
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,920
 And so what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna keep doing

996
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,520
 what I've been doing.

997
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,200
 I made the decision to transition off staff for a season.

998
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,360
 Because I believe that our God is a restoring God,

999
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,000
 I believe that I will be back fully restored

1000
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,600
 to ministry one day.

1001
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,480
 I do believe that.

1002
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,640
 However, I am gonna take a season away

1003
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,480
 because I wanna really make sure,

1004
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
 I wanna make sure that God has healed

1005
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,360
 every part of my heart.

1006
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,560
 I wanna grieve my dad, honestly.

1007
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,240
 I wanna really grieve it.

1008
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,840
 I wanna focus on my marriage, on my community.

1009
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,640
 I wanna be invested in church.

1010
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,280
 And I just wanna be restored.

1011
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,200
 And so, I wanna ask you guys for forgiveness.

1012
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,880
 I love you guys.

1013
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,960
 I'm gonna be sad, I'm gonna miss this place a lot.

1014
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,640
 You guys are like a family to me.

1015
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,320
 But please be praying.

1016
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,440
 Please be praying as we enter into this next season.

1017
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,320
 As I continue to heal and continue to walk with Jesus

1018
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,200
 and people, just be praying for me and for my family,

1019
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,520
 for the people around me.

1020
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,680
 It was fitting, every year I asked God, every birthday,

1021
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,240
 so that trip, I asked God, what is the word for the year?

1022
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,760
 And he said, more.

1023
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,680
 And I didn't know what that meant at the time.

1024
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,160
 And it's just so funny that tonight, I'm here,

1025
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,000
 the passage, the end of the passage,

1026
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,600
 the end of the prayer, what does he say?

1027
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,600
 He says, now to him who is able to do immeasurably more,

1028
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,040
 then all we can ask or imagine, according to his power

1029
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,640
 that is at work within us, to him,

1030
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,120
 be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus

1031
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,120
 throughout all generation forever and ever, amen.

1032
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,200
 And I'm hopeful.

1033
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,280
 I believe that God is about to do immeasurably more

1034
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,400
 for this ministry and my life and I hope in your life.

1035
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,760
 And I just wanna say as I wrap up,

1036
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,960
 and these guys come up here to pray over me,

1037
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,800
 do not wait like I did.

1038
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:24,440
 God was granting me little signs along the way.

1039
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,220
 Hey, are you sure you're fully healed from that?

1040
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,760
 Are you sure you're fully well from that?

1041
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,080
 Are you sure you're being honest

1042
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,000
 about the burdens you're carrying?

1043
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,640
 And I chose to keep going and keep going

1044
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,040
 until it all came up.

1045
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,960
 And so I would just ask you tonight, whatever it is,

1046
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,760
 let this be your warning sign.

1047
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,720
 We're no different.

1048
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,040
 We're called.

1049
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,760
 We are all called if you are in Christ.

1050
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,360
 Let this be your warning sign.

1051
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,120
 Talk to somebody.

1052
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,680
 Bring it to the light.

1053
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,440
 Be free.

1054
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,800
 And my prayer is that tonight would be a night

1055
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,400
 that God does immeasurably more.

1056
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,240
 Thank you.

1057
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,740
 (congregation applauding)

1058
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,040
 - We love JD.

1059
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,080
 He's got people around him.

1060
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,840
 He decided to share here,

1061
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,760
 which is a reflection of his character.

1062
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,900
 This wasn't a come up.

1063
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,840
 This was a, hey, I love these people.

1064
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,560
 And we believe, and I've said since I met JD,

1065
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,860
 I love him and believe in him and wanna pray

1066
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,680
 and ask that he would do more.

1067
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,440
 And Father, I thank you for JD.

1068
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,040
 I thank you for the life,

1069
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,760
 the man that he is.

1070
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,120
 I thank you for the courage he has consistently had.

1071
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,720
 I thank you for the openness.

1072
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,980
 And we ask that you would do immeasurably more

1073
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,800
 than all we could ever ask, think, or imagine.

1074
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,560
 We thank you that you are not done with any of us

1075
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,000
 and none of us deserve anything.

1076
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,720
 And yet you allow us to be a part of that.

1077
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,540
 I thank you for him.

1078
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,540
 I thank you for just the ways he is following you

1079
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:16,240
 and setting an example for all those in this room.

1080
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,920
 And so I pray that he would leave tonight

1081
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,820
 and I pray that you would allow your spirit

1082
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,600
 to strengthen his inner being

1083
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:31,080
 and you would allow him to know how deeply loved he is.

1084
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,000
 And that has never changed, that will never change.

1085
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,280
 And you would do through his life,

1086
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,060
 through this season and through the future,

1087
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,040
 through his surrender and faithfulness to you

1088
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,760
 more than we could ever ask, think, or imagine,

1089
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,200
 would you do more for your glory

1090
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,800
 in this generation and every generation.

1091
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,660
 In Christ's name, amen.

1092
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:59,640
 (congregation applauding)

1093
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,880
 (gentle music)

1094
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,320
 We love JD and I'm so proud of him.

1095
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,680
 And like I said, that he made that decision

1096
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:17,360
 and he made that decision because he knows who loves him,

1097
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,060
 his security, where it comes from,

1098
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,820
 and wants Jesus above anything else.

1099
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,720
 And all of us in life have seasons where we need to say,

1100
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,640
 man, I need to step back.

1101
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,920
 God, I want Jesus more than anything else.

1102
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,020
 And I think some,

1103
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,860
 one or someones,

1104
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,960
 maybe God has you here.

1105
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,680
 So you could see that step of faithfulness.

1106
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,320
 I'm just saying, God,

1107
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,080
 I don't want anything that's gonna get in the way of you.

1108
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,280
 And I can respond to your love

1109
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,280
 and I can bring out and confess,

1110
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,240
 walk in the light and do that

1111
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,920
 'cause I'm securing that love.

1112
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,280
 And so I wanna pray for us

1113
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,720
 and I wanna pray for all of us in the room

1114
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,000
 to be more and more of

1115
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,800
 God's men and God's women.

1116
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,660
 And I'm gonna do so by doing what Paul did

1117
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,500
 here in just a second.

1118
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,260
 I'm gonna hit knees and just pray that God

1119
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,660
 would allow all of us to have an experience

1120
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,260
 of the things that Paul asked for.

1121
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,420
 But if you're in that season,

1122
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,580
 man, God is whispering to you,

1123
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,660
 I love you and I want you to experience

1124
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,920
 more of my love by stepping towards freedom.

1125
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,540
 Let me pray.

1126
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:55,220
 Father, I pray for every believer

1127
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,800
 (gentle music)

1128
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,020
 who has the spirit of God

1129
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:06,260
 in dwelling them in this place,

1130
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,000
 in every location,

1131
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,980
 maybe at a future day that's listening

1132
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,580
 and I bow my knees before the Father.

1133
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:22,460
 And I pray that you would allow Christ to lead our lives.

1134
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,660
 And we just say, God, if there is an area

1135
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,780
 where there's redecorating,

1136
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:31,280
 would you help us by the power of your spirit?

1137
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,320
 I pray that you would allow us to have an awareness

1138
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,380
 of how deeply loved that we are

1139
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,020
 and we would come back to that and come back to that

1140
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,460
 and that would anchor us,

1141
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,580
 that we would live lives that do what your

1142
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:51,100
 younger brother Jude wrote in his letter.

1143
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,580
 Keep yourselves in the love of God as you wait,

1144
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,020
 keep yourselves in the love of God.

1145
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:03,900
 And Father, would we seek to be filled and satisfied in you?

1146
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,480
 Forgive us for all the ways that we don't.

1147
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,380
 And would you help us by your spirit?

1148
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:20,700
 We pray all of this in the name of Jesus, amen.
