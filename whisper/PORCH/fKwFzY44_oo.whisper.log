[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   [Music]
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Fayetteville, Austin, Texas, Houston, Texas, Cedar Rapids,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Iowa, El Paso, Fort Worth, Boise, Idaho, and all the Ports
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and all the Ports, live locations, everybody tuning in
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   online.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We are doing something special tonight.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Let me start us off by telling a story that happened this past
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   week that will give us direction for where we are going to go.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   There is something that has come on the scene, I don't know if
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   it's the past two years, five years, or just I missed it for
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   like a decade and it's been here for a while.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's called an escape room.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Anyone familiar with an escape room?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   This is a thing.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   If you are not familiar, it's basically you pay somebody $200
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   to lock you in a closet and figure out how to get out of
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   there.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And they are making a killing off of this thing.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   It's a team bonding experience.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   This past week we went to an escape room, Escapeology, in
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   the heart of Dallas.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Went in there and given the instructions on our room.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And we go into this room.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   If you have never been in one, you have to figure out how to
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   break -- you have to figure out the mystery.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I really should have thought this through.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I was going to explain it.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You have to think through how to get out.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You have to follow certain clues and read and diagram in order to
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   solve the mystery.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Ours was a murder mystery.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   You have to solve who murdered the person in order to get the
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   eventual code that allows you out of the room.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But there's all these different turns and things that are
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   involved in trying to figure out the story.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So it's you and five people.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You have one hour to make it happen.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And you're trying to get it done.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   This was the most challenging escape room I have ever even
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   heard of.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Whoever came up with this thing intentionally made it to where
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   it would be impossible to get out of there without asking for
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   clues or asking for help.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   In other words, in the escape room, you can hit a button at
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   any time and say, hey, we're stuck.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Give us some way of getting out of here.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Give us the next clue.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Because we can't make the next thing.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And this one was so challenging.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I was insulted by the clues they would give.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Turn this thing around.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   There's Braille in the background.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   You want to figure out how to read Hebrew.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And walk through it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And you thought we were going to get here on our own by doing
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   this.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Every single time it was designed to where without help from the
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   outside you were not getting out.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And you thought, what does that have to do with what we are
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   talking about tonight.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   We are in a season of life, just in general as our country and
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   really for the last number of months where a lot of us have
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   felt like in life we are stuck.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We're covered in anxiety.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   The rates of suicide.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I was reading it before and talking with a friend.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   One in four young adults in the last 90 days have contemplated
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   suicide.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Things have gotten so bad and so overwhelmed and so anxious.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   They thought about ending their life.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   One in four.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Think about that.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Antidepressants are up 600% since COVID hit.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   The number of young adults before COVID who were
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   experiencing anxiety was through the roof and now it's just
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   exploded.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And all of us coming to the room with different degrees to the
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   level of which we are feeling anxious, uncertain, overwhelmed.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And we're stuck in our head.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And what I want to do for the next handful of minutes is talk
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   through what it looks like to conquer some of that anxiety and
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   those anxious and fearful thoughts and conquer the toxic
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   thinking.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Because so often people will -- in attempting to help people
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   get unstuck from overwhelmed and trapped in my head and sad and
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   battling depression.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   People come along and well-meaning and give messages,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   and positive things.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Sometimes pastors who go into a self-help mode.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   While it may feel good in the moment, it doesn't lead to
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   transformation.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And it makes me think no weapon formed against me will stand.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I will conquer this and get the job and not get sick and
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   everything is perfect.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And then it doesn't happen.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And those truths were never helpful and didn't help me get
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   out of the room.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I'm going to do something positive.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   But what if there was a way to get help from the outside?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And by that I don't mean a specific speaker myself or a
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   friend I'm about to bring up.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I mean from God's word on the clues of how to conquer and work
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   through and get out of some of the toxic anxious thinking and
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   feelings that mark our lives.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   The good news is the Bible says that there is a way.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And it doesn't come from self-help or positive thinking.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It comes from the truth contained in God's word.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And what I want to do in a few minutes is walk through a
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   crucial topic with a gifted friend and minister who has
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   devoted the last 18 months or long amount of time studying
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   what it looks like and how all the ways that our toxic thinking
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   God's word really does give us the clues to help break out and
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   experience freedom from some of the anxiety.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   My guess is if you came in the room and I said, hey, if you hit
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   this, most people would hit it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And it may not be that simple but it is clear in God's word,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   he gives us paths that we can choose to get on and choose to
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   battle against anxious fearful thinking.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So I'm going to bring up a friend, her name is Jenny Allen.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   She wrote a book called Get Out of Your Head.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And Jenny, as she gets up here, let me tell you about Jenny.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   If you are not familiar with Jenny, she leads an organization
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   that helps hundreds of thousands of women around the country.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   She's a New York Times best-selling author and a mom of
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   four and a tremendously gifted minister and a gift to our body.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And a member of Watermark.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And every now and then you run into people, man, the spirit of
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   God is at work through them.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And Jenny is someone that every time I'm around her, I sense
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   that and see that and constantly encouraged.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   She wrote a book called Get Out of Your Head and I asked her,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   what is it that you can do to help us talk through.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Because you put into word form practically how God's word helps
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   us and why it's so important that we get out of our head.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Welcome to the stage, Jenny Allen.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   [Applause]
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Thank you, David.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Come on.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Great to be here, guys.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   How you doing?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So Jenny wrote a book, man, I left it down there.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Get Out of Your Head.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Jenny has written a number of books and been a part of
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Watermark.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And I mean everything that I said, Jenny, such a gift to the
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   church and generation.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   If you don't know about if gathering and you're a girl,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   for girls, you need to know about if gathering.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Check that out, I think in March or at some point.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I read through this two different times and so encouraged
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   by it.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Because this generation in particular, everybody right now
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   is stuck in our head, feeling anxious.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   There's uncertainty.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   And no, I don't think uncertainty is increased.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Because we all live in 100% uncertainty every single day.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Like everything is uncertain.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Whether, you know, we realized it or not, COVID has made things
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   feel and the climate has made it feel uncertain.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   So just wanted to launch into this conversation and talk up
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   to you, what made you decide to write this book and open into
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   the conversation of anxiety.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And why is -- in the book you call it the battle, the most
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   important battle of this generation is taking place in
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   the mind.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Most people don't realize it.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But it is shaping your future, it's shaping your life.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   It's shaping who you're going to marry, who you're becoming.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's shaping all of your life right now.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   So just why is that so important?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Why would you say that?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And what made you passionate about it?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah, well, you know, this is the thing.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   This is so random.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I'm going to start with a really interesting funny story.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So one of my friends sent me an article in Cosmo where they
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   talked about my book.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Which is really interesting because it's very Jesus.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   In fact I have a whole portion about it not being self-help.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It's interesting that Cosmo shared my book.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And what they said is, it's like Jenny Allen knew that you know
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   what was going to hit the fan.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   This Christian book is in Cosmo with a cuss word about it.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And I think the funny thing is, I didn't.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But God did.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Like God knew that this book would come out two months before
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   COVID hit.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And I can't explain that.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   There's no way I could ever, you know, make this happen in life.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You just know that there is a God that cares about people.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Because this topic, it wasn't even the book I was supposed to
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   write.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I shifted gears two years before and went to work and put my head
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   down on this book.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And put another book that I was almost done with to the side.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And so God knew the timing was going to matter.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And I start with that story because the timing matters.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   And what he just said is exactly right.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   What happened is the lake drained.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And we all saw it was at the bottom of our lakes.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And what was at the bottom of our lakes was a lot of mess.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And so I think it's not new stuff.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I think it was already there.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   But I do think that what we found was, wow, I have been
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   anxious probably for a long time.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I may have been busy enough that I didn't notice.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Or I have been depressed for a long time.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And we're starting to even consider maybe I need to get
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   some help.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I think that's what is powerful about COVID.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   What you said was so right, David.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I don't think we found ourselves in a unique moment that has
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   produced a lot of anxiety.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I think we found ourselves in a moment that revealed the anxiety
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   we already felt.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Why did you write it?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I know you have a lot of things on your mind.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   What shifted or led you down that journey?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I know you talk about doubt and that wrestle.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And I think that's part of the reason.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   How would you say?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Two things.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   One, my daughter Kate is 18 years old.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   She's a freshman at A&M.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And for five years -- yeah.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   For five years, I'm a razor bat.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   [Laughter]
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Just throw that in there.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I'm a razor bat.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   It's hard, y'all.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I got two Aggies.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   What did I do?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   God's people, man.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Anyway.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So my daughter is in seventh grade and she gets this passion
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and heart for neuroscience.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And she starts reading and watching Ted Talks on it.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And so I start doing this with her.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And it's so interesting.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Because when I started doing the science work on this book, I
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   thought it was going to be in opposition to the Bible.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   But it actually completely revealed what the Bible says is
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   true.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   That our brains can change.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That our brains physically are changing based on what we think
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   about.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   So our chemistry, our body is very connected to the brain that
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   God built.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   That's not surprising to Christians.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Right?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Christians know that God built all of this to work together and
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   for others good and for his glory.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And so when something is broken in our mind, it begins to affect
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   every part of us.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And I think that's where I started to get so passionate.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I minister to women and I talk about emotions.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   My first Bible study was stuck and walks through the emotions
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   we face.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But I didn't see our side of the church really talking about the
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   mind.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And about how we could shift it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And yet everything I was reading in science and psychiatry and
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   all of these things were absolutely echoing what the
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Bible says.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   They just completely fell short.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And I was like, I don't know how to introduce this.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   They would end the book.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   It would be biblical in the sense that you can change your
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   brain and your brain can change.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And towards the end it would say, so what you need to do is
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   think positive thoughts about yourself.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   That you are awesome.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And all of these positive self-esteem things.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And I was thinking, well, I just am not.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So I don't exactly know like how that's supposed to help.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   If I don't feel awesome about myself.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Am I just supposed to tell myself that I'm worth something?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And so I think watching my daughter for five years, five
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   years she was pursuing this.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I saw and read a lot and I realized the church is afraid of
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   this topic and yet it is absolutely biblical.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   So that was the first thing.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   The second thing that happened was I went through a season of
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   doubt for 18 months.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Following a crazy story that it was just dark.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And so I entered into this season of just wrestling with my
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   faith.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And for 18 months I woke up in the middle of the night and
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   asked myself, is this true?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Does it fade to black?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Why are you wasting your life on this if it's not?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And that sounds very alarming.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   But somehow, you know, in my experience the devil never likes
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   to be noticed.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   He wants to do things in a very subtle way.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And so looking at that over time, I don't think I let
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   anybody in or I talked about it.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   But it wasn't because I was embarrassed or hiding it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It was that I didn't think it was a big deal.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And yet 18 months later I feel my faith eroding.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I would be speaking on stages about Jesus and in the back of
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   my head I would be questioning, am I selling a myth?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Y'all, let me just tell you, you don't know my faith.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You don't know my story.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   But I have gotten to be someone who has walked on waves and
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   seen God do complete miracles.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   The fact that I was questioning my faith did not equal the life
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I was leading at all.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And I don't tell anybody and 18 months later I do finally open
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   my mouth and say this has gotten pretty bad.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Now the irony is the reason I finally told people was I
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   watched the second to last Avengers movie.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And it's the one, I'm sorry if y'all don't know this but you
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   are really late and I'm not going to protect you from the
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   spoiler.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   The second to last one, y'all know what happens.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Some of the superheroes and half the earth evaporates into dust.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   That's the worst.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Yeah, it's a bummer.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And then they leave you there.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So I see that movie, you guys, and I go home and I can't
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   breathe.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And for two to three days I'm having panic.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Because that's what I'm afraid of.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I'm just afraid it goes to dust.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And that none of it mattered.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And I'm like, I'm not going to watch that movie again.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And finally I start talking and realizing this is really
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   affecting me.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   My fear of death.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I can't even watch a Marvel movie without having panic
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   attacks.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And so I mention it to a friend and what happens when I bring
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   somebody into it.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Two things.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   First thing that happens is I said it out loud and as I heard
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   myself say, I don't know if I even believe in God anymore.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   That's how dramatic it was.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I love wrestling with stuff like that.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It was dramatic when I said it.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And as the words came out of my mouth, I started laughing.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And I was like, that's not true.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I believe in God.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Like I literally heard myself say what I had been saying in my
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   head for 18 months.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And I said it.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And I was so aware that it was not true.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And my sweet friend that heard it, she watches me live and
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   she's like, Ginny, that's not true.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I watched you live the last two years.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   You love and trust God.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And then the second thing I said, I think I have been under
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   spiritual attack.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I mean it was obvious and I totally missed it.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And so after that, to answer your question, I got angry.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Like this wasn't any longer just this situation of you know what?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   We all think negative thoughts.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Let's be authentic about it.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   What are you thinking negatively and what is your anxiety.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Let's talk about it.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   It turned to war.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I was like no, no, no.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   This is the enemy and he got me alone in the dark and told me
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   whatever he wanted.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And I am not going to let that happen to half the church.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Or you know there is a bunch of guys here, I will bring you into
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   it too.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I am not going to let that happen.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Because if we are in a place where the enemy can tell us --
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I grew up in a church where they said don't talk about the devil
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   too much.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And I read Ephesians and dark cosmic forces are coming for us.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And I thought let's talk about it a little.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And on this subject, I think we need to bring that in.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And I will tell you why in a minute.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Because there is scripture that brings it in clearly.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   That we are not fighting flesh.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   That we are fighting spirit.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And we have to recognize that there is a war for our minds.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.

[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And we have to recognize that we are fighting spirit.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   I am reading this verse again...
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Do we believe that?
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Like if we don't believe that church, we don't have anything
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   else to stand on.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Like the medicine, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   The other stuff is only going to be a fix for a little while.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   The practical ways that we can be grateful instead of negative.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   All of that, those practices are powerful.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And God taught us about these practices that help us be
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   grateful.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And help us train our minds and discipline our minds.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   The scripture is full of that and we will talk about some of
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   those.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   But if we don't understand first and foremost that we are at war
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and there is an enemy and he wants to kill, steal and destroy
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   you.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And you have power and authority and divine weapons that destroy
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   strongholds.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And I am like, that's where -- let's wake up to that first so
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   that we quit playing defense.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And honestly we are not even playing defense.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And like he's just beating us up.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Like that's what I did for 18 months.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   He just beat me up for 18 months and I let him.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And that's where I am going, okay, let's change our posture.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Let's start with this.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   That one, do you realize that the spirit of God is available
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   to you.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   And that he wants to work with you and fight the enemy with
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   you.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And that there are people that want to help you fight the
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   enemy.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   And that there is a word that teaches us how to fight the
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   enemy.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But it's all going somewhere.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   And it's not like I am going to get fixed today.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   That's what I am going to do.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   That's how we read scripture, we want it to fix us.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Rather than we are at war.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And everything you think and everything you feel and every
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   behavior you have and every relationship you have, it's
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   playing into that war.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And so the cost if we don't fight back, if we just let the
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   enemy stick us in a corner with anxiety and make us obsess about
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   ourselves and our problems.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Instead of the power of God in me and through me and what can
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   happen.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   That is terrifying and it shuts us down.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And so what I love about scripture is it starts with this
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   big story and narrative.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Hey, let's start with Hebrews 12, part of the narrative.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Run the race that is set before you, fixing your eyes on Jesus
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   and throwing off the burden and weight that is set before you.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   And I think as we are going, as we realize, okay, all of this is
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   supposed to fit into this bigger story where there is a plan and
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   it is to take me out.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   There is a plan and it is to take you out.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So we have got to start with -- and let me tell you why this
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   matters.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Because then you hate it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Then you are like motivated.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   It's not just about your happiness.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   It's not just about your freedom.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   It's not just about the way you have a greater impact on the
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   kingdom.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   It is about eternity.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And if you realize that that anxiety -- I don't mean to put
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   too much weight on it but I think we haven't put enough, right.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I can see y'all, are y'all with me?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Okay.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   So I think we put too much of just this passing idea that we
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   are just victims and how we feel and how we -- you know, what
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   we are thinking about.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   All of these things, this is my lot.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   I struggle with anxiety.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And I am like, all right, how are we going to fight that?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Let's start fighting that.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And let's not take that for granted and struggle with this
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   for the next 50, 60 years we have on earth.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And if we change our posture, yes, there are things we can
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   do that help in that fight that scripture is clear about.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   But I think what I hope you hear from this and what I hope you
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   take away is that you have a lot more power than you think.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And I think what I hope you take away is that so many people that
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   have processed this and read the book and gone through months
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   after that and what it looks like for them is that you will
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   start to sense that you are anxious like I did today and
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   you will say, you know what, I don't want to stay there and I
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   don't want my brain to stay there for more than a day.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   So I am going to go -- I am going to make a priority for my
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   mind today and sit down with somebody that loves me and sit
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   down with somebody that loves me and I will be able to do that
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and I will be able to do that.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   And I will be able to do that.

[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   And I will be able to do that.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And I will be able to do that.

[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   >> 2,000 years before Freud or any of you came along, welcome to where we have been for 2,000 years.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And so that's why this is such a crucial and important topic.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   And anything you would add on that?
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   >> Oh, that's good.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Yeah, I just -- I feel like --
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   >> I thought so.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   It was well delivered.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   >> Well done.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I mean, here's the thing.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   We're all trying so hard to work on our behavior.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   And this is why if you have never done the work in your life.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   If you have been abused in any form.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Any form.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   If you have -- you know, for all of us.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   I bet most of us can remember a time when everything changed.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   You may not have been physically abused.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   But you can remember when you picked up one of those lies.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I was 12 years old.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   I'm sitting in my dad's recliner with him.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   And I felt so safe.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   Safe enough to sit like really close to my dad.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And just sit there and talk to him.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   And we were looking at the ceiling.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   I remember it had popcorn.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We were in my childhood home.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   And I remember he started asking me questions like this.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   12 years old.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Do you think you're going to make homecoming court this year?
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Do you think, you know, so-and-so likes you?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   How are your grades?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   He was running through a list of things that I could tell.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   He thought if you maximize those things, then you're going to be a good daughter.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   Then you're going to be a good human.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   And as a little girl, it's the first time I remember feeling like I am not safe.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   And I am not enough as I am.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   And that began a journey for me that I struggled with until 30 years old.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Where I felt like I could not hit an invisible line that kept moving.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   And I was chasing it with all my guts.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   And I loved God.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   And I was a competing idol of approval.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   That ran right beside my love for God.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And that verse in Hebrews 12, that it hindered me.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And was it my fault that I picked that up?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   No.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   But was it my fault that I didn't fight it?
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   Yes.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   So there's probably a moment that you can remember when that lie entered in.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   And so we've got to do this work.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I know some of you guys are like, oh, my gosh.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   I'm going to have some deep talk with my girlfriend tonight.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   I feel it.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   But I promise you it is worth going back and figuring out what did you pick up?
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And where did you pick it up?
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Because if it is from the enemy, which all lies are from him.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   John tells us Jesus was really clear, he's the father of lies and it's his native tongue.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   It's how he speaks.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   So if we just let those lies grow in us, we don't want to live with that anymore.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And I think that's a really important thing.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   I think that's a really important thing.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   I think that's a really important thing.

[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   So you have been married to Zach?
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   23 years.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   23 years.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Razorback?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   No, we met at Canica camps.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Nothing like a good camp love story.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   We were kissing in the K-Dome.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   Wow, that definitely violates camp policy.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   It did.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Sorry, Joe.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   It ended up working out.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   And you guys have four kids.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   What would you say to most of the room by far is single.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And in terms of qualities that drew you to Zach.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   No marriage is perfect.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   I know you guys have been shared here before.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   We're all on a journey.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   But what were the qualities that drew you to Zach other than he
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   was a good French kisser in the K-Dome.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   He was.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   That was a joke.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   He is.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Okay.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Save the e-mail.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   What qualities would you say, man, these are the things to look for.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Because you have a daughter.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And you have young adult kids who you would say, these are the qualities to look for in a husband.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Absolutely.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   This is a little bit secret story I don't think I have ever told.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Right before we got married, this is probably two months.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   So we didn't do save the date back then.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   That's a new expensive feature of weddings.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   So that hadn't gone out.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   But it was probably about the time that would have gone out.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   And I was having doubts that I should marry him.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   And I remember we were long-distance dating.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   And I was like, I don't know.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   And I remember we were long-distance dating.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   And so I barely knew the guy.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   We just -- it was scary that we were getting married.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Except that the guy was godly.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   And I remember one day we were together.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   And I was like, Lord, I can't go into marriage wondering if I should be married to this guy.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   You have to seal the deal here.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And I prayed.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   I remember that day going to war with it and saying, God, you have to be clear with me if this is the man I am supposed to marry.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   And of course a voice from the sky -- I am just kidding.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   That didn't happen.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   But what did happen is I opened my Bible and I began to go, okay, what do we know about marriage?
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   What do we know about the kind of guy I should marry?
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And I just began to write a list in my little journal.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   And I was like, he needs to be humble.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   He needs to pray.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   He needs to be committed and surrender to Jesus and do whatever he says.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Check.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   He needs to honor me.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   He needs to believe that I have, you know, gifts and that he's going to partner with me in those.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   Check.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And I was like, okay, I am going to do that.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   Because it was super simple things.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   And at the end of that, I looked at the list and I was like, is this who he is?
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   And the answer was absolutely yes.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   I mean, he's not perfect in any of those things.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   In fact, we went on to have difficult first five years of marriage and did get some counseling, a lot of counseling after that.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   But he was a godly man.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   And he loved him and he was going to follow him and I knew it.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   And so I committed to marry the man.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   And I'm saying this because I think we think there's some special feeling that will come over us at some point that's like, light, shine from heaven, anoint the girl, this is her.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   And I'm having these conversations with my kids.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   I was like, it doesn't work like that.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Look around and see who's following God.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   I don't know if you're attracted.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Yes, maybe that's a part of it.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   But no, that's not really a biblical part of it.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Marrying a girl that loves God and is spending her life doing that.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Because the purpose of marriage is that we display the relationship between Jesus and the church.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   And if it is not sacrificial, if it is not committed no matter what to biblical story lines that he's given us, then I don't see -- it's just what the TV teaches us.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   It's just what, you know, it's just what culture teaches us.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   That's not love.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   What love is, is two people committed to God and committing to each other for all their life.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   And it won't feel -- because here's the thing.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   If you get the attraction, good.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   But it will go away.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   So it's like why chase something that's fickle.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   If you get a guy, and I did, and I was attracted to him at different times.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   But I did -- he's going to kill me.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   He's watching live.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   I love you, baby.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   I'm so attracted to you now.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Oh, my gosh, I'm in so much trouble.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   But it wasn't -- what did you say?
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Nothing.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   I'm not going to repeat it.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   But it wasn't about the attraction.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   It was that I just felt confused and I didn't feel sure.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   And what made me sure was not feelings that seemed to come and go.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   It was the character of God that I saw in his life.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   And I think that is what has seen us through 23 years.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   And I look at him now, y'all, and I am totally attracted to him, baby.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   I am so attracted to you.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   I cannot wait to get home tonight.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   But -- but -- but it isn't about that even today.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   Because if that goes away tomorrow, I don't care.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Like I'm in this with this man to be for the good of people and the glory of God.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   So it's just a different way to view marriage.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   And we are such teammates and we have fun and we are running the race.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   But it was built on a vision of obeying God together, not on feelings.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   So good.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Okay, last question, just as we wrap up.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   Your ministry has given you a platform.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   You speak to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people a year.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   A lot of them are young adults.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   You have young adult kids.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Anything you would say to encourage, sharpen, challenge,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   just if you had a few minutes to just share anything with this group and those listening.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I would say this.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   That go build a life that is building heaven.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   And leave the details out of that.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   If you can look around at your life.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   And I'm not talking about vocational ministry, for goodness sakes.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   I'm largely ministering.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   We largely minister to Christians.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   You know, you guys are the ones in the trenches.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   What we're supposed to do is equip the saints for the work of the kingdom.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   I'm just talking about in everything you're doing, like spending it in this eternal story we've been talking about tonight.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   And the reason I say that is, guys, I don't know how much longer we have before Jesus is going to come back.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   And my sense is I'm spending a lot of time actually with Gen Z right now.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   That's a lot of who we minister to is college students.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   I'm looking at Gen Z and some of you are in that category.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   And I'm going, we may be preparing them to usher in the kingdom.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   There's that sense in me of just, I want you to be Daniels in Babylon.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   And I want you to know God and to be disciplined and to care about -- I mean, when that becomes the storyline,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   when you're like, you know what, Jesus could come back soon.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   I work with Bible translation too.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   I'm a big translator for a people group in a jungle.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   I just give them money.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   But I do think that in 13 years they're saying that we're going to have reached every single language.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   13 years, which is one of the things that has to happen before Jesus can come back.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   So the fact that we're closing in on almost everything that we would need for revelation to happen,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   for Jesus to come back, means that we should be taking our lives very seriously.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   And so the addiction, the distraction, the anxiety that I see in the church,
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   I want to fight it not so that you can live happier lives, so that we can usher in the kingdom of God together.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   Because we might just be up.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Like it might be the calling of our lives.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   So take it all seriously.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   Take it all seriously.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Because we don't want to be those that are sleeping when he comes back.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   We want to be those that are running and we're out of breath and we're not surprised.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   We're like, hallelujah, I don't even have to die.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Like I get to just fly up to heaven.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   You know?
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Let's be that.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   And I think if we could take it that seriously, you know, I just -- gosh, the world needs hope right now.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   And we could be that hope for them.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   >> So good.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Would you mind -- yeah.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Would you mind praying that that would be the case and praying in particular for anyone who is trapped,
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   whether they would say that or not, just in the spiral of fear or anxiety or lust or anger or just sad.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   I'm going to pray on my knees.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   Because we are fighting spiritual forces.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Because the greatest desire of the enemy would to cause every single human that hears my voice right now to be stuck
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   and helpless and hopeless and distracted and addicted, checked out.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   And, God, that is against your will for us.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   And I believe things are at stake that we can't imagine, and yet you imagine them and you know them.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   And so I pray for your spirit to set us free, God, and not in some magical way,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   but in participation, choices that we make every day to pursue you instead of pursue the world.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   To pursue you instead of pursue our flesh and what it craves and what it wants.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   God, I pray for a holy people set apart and blameless, God, not perfect, but covered with the blood and living like it.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Believing it, God, not just saying, yeah, I'm a Christian, but believing that that changes everything and letting it.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   God, I pray against half-heartedness.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   I pray, God, that our whole hearts would be surrendered to you.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   And at any place that they're not, God, would you root it out, would you show us, would you help us name it.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   The place that we've loved something more than you, that we've let the enemy lie to us,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   that we've completely submitted to darkness in a way that is not pleasing to you.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   God, show us, make it so clear where we can't shake it and help us confess it.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   Help us surrender it.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   God, I pray for every person hearing my voice, God, would they not be apathetic?
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Would they walk out of here, would they grab people by the shoulder and say, how can I fight for you?
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   How can I pray for you?
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   How can I help you love Jesus more?
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   Would we be those kind of people for each other?
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Would we believe that you are more powerful than the enemy that is seeking to kill, steal, and destroy us?
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   And would we act like it?
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   And would we go to your word constantly?
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   God, not even daily, but hour by hour, would we be going to it constantly?
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Because it is the only hope that we have.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Without it, God, we are hopeless, we are helpless, we are worthless, we are unlovable.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   But because of you, we are the most loved people on planet Earth.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   So help, God, that love go and reach out to the ends of the Earth.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   God, I just, I picture everybody in here, and I'm picturing this generation, and I'm picturing us in heaven.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   And I just, I want so badly, more than anything else on Earth,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   I want so badly for us to get up there and like high-five and be like, "We left it on the field."
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   Like, "We did everything we could to build the kingdom of God while we were here."
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   And so anything prohibiting that in me, in us,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   God, take it out and help us be faithful to choose you day after day.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   - Amen. - Thanks, guys.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   - Thank you, Jenny.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Can you guys give it up for Jenny Allen? Thank you, Jenny.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   I'm just going to wrap this up, and we're going to close in song.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   I think some of us in the room, we're in that escape room.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   And you're in that place, and you feel stuck.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   And I want you to know it's because you are.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   And it may be stuck in depression.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   It may be stuck in anxiety.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   It may be stuck in a pornography addiction.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   It may be stuck in a really toxic relationship.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   It may be stuck in that there's so much trauma from sexual abuse you've never told anybody about.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   It wasn't your fault, but you've never dealt with that.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   And now it begins to bleed out into your life.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   You don't trust people because of what your dad did.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   And you're stuck, and you're in those walls, not physically, but inside of your mind and inside of your life.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   And it's impacting the rest of your future and your current reality.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   And you're going to be there, and you're going to be stuck until you do what we had to do in that escape room,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   where you're willing to say, "Hey, I don't care. I need help. I need help. I need a clue.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   I need something from the outside to help me get unstuck."
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   And you go to God's Word and God's people, and you know what you're going to find?
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   You're going to find steps towards freedom.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   And you don't have to stay stuck, but let me be abundantly clear, you're going to,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   until you're willing to do what the Bible says is called "surrender."
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   I can't do it all on my own. I can't fight this on my own.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   You weren't made to fight it on your own.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   You were made to go to God's people, to God's Word, and to say, "I need help."
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   And tonight is a chance for you to do that.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   And if you take those steps, your life and your future is going to change.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   And if you don't, let me be clear, if you're 30, 10 years from now, you're going to be the same.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   That thing you're hiding, eating disorder, past abortion, shame and guilt you carry,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   they're not going away.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   If anything, they may just grow and grow until you're willing to say, "I need help."
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   And what you'll find is God, His Word, His people, will come rushing in.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   And tonight I wanted you to hear, there are steps that you can take.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   But you've got to be willing to say, "Man, I want to be free. I need help."
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   Others of you, you're in a place where you need to know that you,
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   the greatest thing you need to surrender is the fact that you think that you could earn a relationship with God.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   You've never put your faith in Jesus. In fact, you don't even know what the Bible teaches.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   You think the Bible teaches good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   I just need to be a good person. This place has pretty cool vibes.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   And you know, they don't make me wear a suit in church. That's kind of cool.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   So I'm coming in here, and you think that God is angry at you, can't forgive you.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   You need to read your Bible and attend church, and then He'll love you more.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   Then you could have a relationship with Him.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   And you have bought a lie. The Bible doesn't teach that.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   It teaches not good people in heaven, bad people in hell.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   Forgiven people go to heaven.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   And the only way you get forgiveness is by putting your trust not in what you have done,
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   or what you did, to be the thing that keeps you in relationship with God,
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   or keeps you out of heaven with God.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   That's never been what Christianity teaches.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   It teaches, you know who gets to have a relationship with God?
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   You know whose life begins to change?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   You know who spends eternity in heaven?
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   People who go, "I'm not enough. I surrender.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   If I'm ever going to have a relationship with God, it's only because of Jesus.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   I think I'm a good person, try to be nice, pay my taxes."
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   Not enough.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   The Bible has never taught those things matter.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   It's never taught those things change how God feels about you.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   It teaches people who say, "I'm a sinner.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   My life is full of messed up decisions I made.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   I have hurt people. I've done things I'm ashamed of."
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   But because Jesus on that cross gave his life for me,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   paid for my decisions, my sin,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   all of those have been forgiven.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   God doesn't hold them against me.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   Any sin in my future, already forgiven.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Because on that cross, the Son of God came to this earth,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   was crucified, was buried, and he rose again.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   And you know what that shows?
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   He paid for all sin ever.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   He conquered all sin. He even conquered death.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   When he rose from the grave, it's like the check cleared.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   The credit card went through.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   It was more than enough.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   People who accept Jesus paid for their sin.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   Those are people who spend eternity with God.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   Those are people whose life changed.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   But you know what it takes in order to do that? It's a really hard thing.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   You've got to say, "I need help.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   I can't do it on my own.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   I can't do it on my own."
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   And you know what? You can't.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   And he's done everything that he can to say, "You can't.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   That's why I gave my life for you."
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   If you'll trust in that,
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   your eternity will change,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   and your present reality will begin to change.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Let me pray.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Father, thank you that you are more powerful
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   than any thought,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   any thought pattern,
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   any cosmic forces of darkness,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   any enemy in this world.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   You're more powerful than any evil that could take place in the hearts of people.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   You're more powerful than sickness, than sin, than death.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   You are victorious,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   and nothing can stand against you.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   And you have allowed us, through your Spirit,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   the weapons to wage war in the mind.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   So I pray tonight that those who are battling anxiety,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   they would experience freedom.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Not just in a moment, but in a day by day, moment by moment,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   second by second, thought by thought, war.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   By holding on to what is true, what's noble, what's pure, what's lovely, what's right,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   you begin to create pathways and change the way that they think,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   and therefore change the way that they live,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   and you would set people free.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   I pray for those who've never put their faith in Jesus.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   Tonight, they would realize they're a sinner.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   They've done things that you, according to your Word,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   you say, "Man, the wages of sin or the repayment for sin,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   the consequences is separation from God."
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   Unless you're willing to say, "I need help,
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   and I accept what you did for me,"
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   that they would receive the payment your Son gave,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   the Savior of the world, the King of kings,
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   and they would find rest in your hands, in your plan, in your love.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   Father, we need your help, all of us.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   We've got 60,000 thoughts a day, many of which, maybe most of which,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   are not in a direction that's leading us to the life that we want.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   They're not captive to your Spirit, so we ask and invite,
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   just plead that you would help us, God.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   Thank you that you provided your Word and your people.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Help us to go to war.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   We love you, in Christ's name, amen.
