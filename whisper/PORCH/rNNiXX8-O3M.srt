1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,300
 Good evening, it is great to worship with you.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,580
 Welcome, Dallas, welcome, Fort Worth.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,960
 If you're tuning in on podcast or streaming online,

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,560
 welcome, those of you who are tuning in around the world.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,260
 It is great to continue in this series in Colossians.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,660
 And so I thought I'd start this evening

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,040
 by talking about something about a month ago.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,800
 Some of you are gonna be like, was that a month ago?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,660
 It was a month ago, our world,

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,500
 I was about to say our country,

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,960
 our entire world was divided on an issue

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,000
 that we must talk about this evening.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,520
 I mean, it separated people.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,360
 Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,820
 I mean, there was this thing that came out

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,920
 that everyone was like, wait a minute,

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,520
 and they landed on one side or the other,

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,920
 and it divided husband and wife and families

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,520
 and congregations and people.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,400
 And so, let me show it to you.

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,720
 (congregation laughing)

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
 There it is.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,180
 There it is, I saw it, I know.

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,480
 And so on three, okay,

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,040
 we're gonna settle this issue on three, ready?

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
 Okay, I want you to scream out what color that dress is.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,240
 If you're lost right now,

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,120
 you've either been locked in a closet or in some,

30
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,760
 I don't know, and so ask a friend,

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,660
 they're gonna share with you.

32
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,060
 But this dress brought down the internet, okay?

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,800
 Ellen DeGeneres said appropriately,

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,720
 Ellen DeGeneres said appropriately

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
 that the world will be divided from here on out,

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,020
 and I agree with her.

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,360
 All right, and so on three,

38
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,900
 we're gonna yell out what color that dress is, ready?

39
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,760
 One, two, three.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,480
 (congregation cheering)

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,460
 That is right, it is white and gold.

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,160
 (congregation cheering)

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
 Thank you.

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,860
 Just by show of hands,

45
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,100
 how many of you yelled out white and gold?

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,460
 Okay, okay, now by show of hands,

47
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,020
 how many yelled out black and blue?

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,580
 Okay, I want all of you who yelled out white and gold

49
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,060
 to pray for the eyes of those who yelled out black and blue.

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,500
 Would you just lay hands on them,

51
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,700
 and we're gonna pray really for the rest of our time

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,400
 that the Lord would open their eyes,

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
 that they would no longer be blind.

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,940
 I'm sad.

55
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,820
 I'm sad.

56
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,660
 I used to be a Taylor Swift fan.

57
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,660
 So she tweeted this.

58
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,500
 This was Taylor Swift's tweet.

59
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 She said, "I don't understand this odd dress debate,

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,240
 "and I feel like it's a trick somehow.

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,720
 "I'm confused and scared.

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,980
 "P.S. it's obviously black, or blue and black."

63
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,080
 (congregation cheering)

64
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,600
 And I was scared too, and honestly, what I thought,

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,440
 here's what I thought,

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,020
 like I just, just in moment of transparency,

67
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,700
 I'm like, this is a trick that the entire world is on.

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,220
 I felt like I was on the Truman Show or something.

69
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,260
 I'm like, okay, it's gotta be white and gold.

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,880
 I don't see anything that could remotely

71
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
 be interpreted as black and blue,

72
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,740
 and so all of these people saying black and blue,

73
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,660
 they're playing a trick on me, and they're all in on it.

74
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,360
 David Marvin's in on it too, and I'm just,

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,580
 I'm frustrated by that.

76
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,120
 I really am wondering, I'm like, I see,

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,780
 I'm like, Taylor Swift's in on it somehow.

78
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,700
 David, talk to Taylor.

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,200
 How did this happen, you know?

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,340
 And it just, it really did divide people,

81
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,740
 and I don't know if you, like, we were talking about it,

82
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,820
 and we were getting fired up.

83
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,220
 It was like, no, no, you know, clearly,

84
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,780
 they did a RGB kind of red, green, blue

85
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,460
 computer experiment in the color,

86
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,740
 and the breakdown, and you don't understand the science,

87
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,760
 and I don't, you know, and people are like,

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,460
 oh, well, the lesser smart people said,

89
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,940
 and you know, and everyone's kind of,

90
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,580
 it becomes competitive, and it really did.

91
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,220
 It divided people, and it was fun just, you know,

92
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,860
 the Twitter traffic that was out there and whatnot,

93
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,780
 and so tonight, we're gonna talk about something else

94
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,860
 that divides people.

95
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,640
 We're talking about this idea of who is Jesus.

96
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,420
 You came into the room this evening

97
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,380
 with some idea of who Jesus is,

98
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,700
 and I'm gonna show you tonight from the scripture

99
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,540
 that I think a small of us, maybe a minority of us

100
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,940
 in the room actually understand who Christ is,

101
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,260
 who he desires to be in our life,

102
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,040
 but we all, everyone here has to answer this question,

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
 who is Jesus?

104
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,260
 It's the same question that the Church of Colossae

105
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,540
 was asking, who is Jesus?

106
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,380
 It's the same reason Paul wrote this letter.

107
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,500
 Hey, I wanna set it straight for you guys.

108
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,340
 I want you to understand who Christ is.

109
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,100
 Stop adding to him, stop changing him,

110
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,220
 stop making him out to be something

111
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,720
 that he was never meant to be,

112
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,940
 but you wanna divide a room.

113
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,140
 I mean, people will talk about God.

114
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,340
 Even atheists will tolerate your conversations about God,

115
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,660
 but when you start talking about Jesus,

116
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,780
 you start talking about the way, the truth, and the lie,

117
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,220
 well, that's exclusivity, that's rude, I can't believe you,

118
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,920
 and all of a sudden, it gets uncomfortable.

119
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,420
 It's divisive.

120
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,780
 It's divisive,

121
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,420
 and so we're asking this question this evening.

122
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,940
 This is the topic, the subject, who is Jesus?

123
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,480
 The Muslim says he's a prophet like Abraham and Moses,

124
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,340
 and a lesser prophet than Muhammad.

125
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,420
 The Jehovah's Witness says he was Michael the archangel

126
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,660
 who came to earth and left his angelic being

127
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,980
 as he was born of a woman,

128
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,300
 and then he was fully man, named Christ.

129
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,220
 The Mormon says that God and Mary had a sexual relationship

130
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,380
 and Jesus was their son, and if you do good things,

131
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,500
 that you too can be like Jesus,

132
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,700
 a child or son or daughter of God,

133
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,420
 and the liberal theologian says that he was a good teacher,

134
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,240
 maybe even that he was a way to God.

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,180
 He had some good understandings,

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,220
 and I will tell you the reason I start with that,

137
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,060
 that dress picture, because for most of my life,

138
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,140
 before I became adult, as I was going to church,

139
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,980
 that's what I thought.

140
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,060
 I thought, hey, this is this kind of superstitious thing

141
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,140
 that we all come into the room

142
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,300
 and we all kind of pretend like Jesus is God,

143
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,140
 and we're even gonna talk to the air,

144
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,940
 and we're all gonna kind of get emotional

145
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,700
 about this idea of God,

146
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,740
 but we all kind of know he doesn't exist.

147
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,300
 And people were talking about a relationship with Christ,

148
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,660
 and I was like, yeah, I wonder,

149
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,180
 can I have a relationship with Christ?

150
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,300
 But then in my heart, I'm like, hey, we all know

151
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,140
 you can't have a relationship with someone you can't see

152
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,760
 or talk to or touch or hug.

153
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,240
 And I'm here tonight to tell you that I've experienced that.

154
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,100
 Maybe that's where you're at, but you can.

155
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,240
 That in fact, life is found in him alone.

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,820
 There is no life apart from him,

157
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,500
 and so if you're here and you don't have him,

158
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,140
 you're experiencing some kind of lesser life.

159
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,420
 And so what we're gonna do this evening

160
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,140
 is we're gonna divide the room, okay?

161
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,660
 I think we'll start with, hey, have you heard of Christ?

162
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,100
 And I think all of our hands would go up.

163
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,220
 We've all, yeah, Jesus, we all heard about Jesus,

164
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,020
 but as we begin to talk about who he is,

165
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,040
 I think more and more,

166
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,700
 you're gonna start disagreeing with me.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,660
 And maybe you won't publicly,

168
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,900
 but in your heart and in your mind,

169
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,020
 you're gonna think, no, I don't know

170
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,540
 that I would be in that group.

171
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,580
 And as we go further, you might say,

172
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,820
 well, no, I was in that last group.

173
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,860
 I don't know that I'd be in that group.

174
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,940
 For when we end tonight from the Scriptures,

175
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,740
 sadly, and I hope I'm wrong,

176
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,120
 there might be a minority of us who actually agrees

177
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,980
 with who Jesus is and who he desires to be in our life.

178
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,020
 This passage in your Scripture

179
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,940
 is called the supremacy of Christ.

180
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,020
 It's a word we don't use often.

181
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,260
 Supremacy is defined as the state of being highest

182
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,780
 in rank or authority, paramount, sovereign, chief.

183
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,300
 This is who Jesus wants to be in your life.

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
 Let me say it to you again.

185
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,460
 Highest rank or authority, paramount, sovereign,

186
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,220
 chief over your life.

187
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,180
 Because here's what I'm certain of, guys.

188
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,080
 100 years from now, I mean 100 years from today,

189
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,420
 we're all, every single person in this room

190
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,140
 is going to realize that the single most important question

191
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,740
 you were asked as you walked on this planet was,

192
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,100
 "Who is Jesus?"

193
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,140
 And that's why this passage in the Scripture

194
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,160
 is so important because it answers it with great clarity.

195
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,740
 I don't know that there's any other passage in Scripture

196
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,780
 that more heresies have come from.

197
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,440
 As people read this and misunderstand what it actually is,

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,980
 it's a song that the Apostle Paul wrote down in Colossians.

199
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,560
 Most commentaries would agree that this is actually a song.

200
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,140
 And he wrote for the purpose of explaining who Jesus was

201
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,940
 so that the Colossians would know,

202
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,220
 the church in Colossae would know and understand.

203
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,180
 And so just to show you where Colossae is,

204
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,580
 here's a picture that it's an actual place on the planet.

205
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,500
 It is the southwest corner of what is modern day Turkey.

206
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,420
 And they have been told, the people there

207
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,900
 that Paul is writing to have been told

208
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,620
 that Jesus isn't enough, that his grace isn't enough.

209
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,180
 And so David very appropriately talked about last week

210
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,540
 how it's not just grace that saves us,

211
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,340
 but it's grace that actually changes us.

212
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,700
 And this week we're going to talk about who this man,

213
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,600
 Jesus, is as they were attempting to redefine him then.

214
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,520
 And your peers, friends, coworkers, family members,

215
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,040
 and people you know are attempting to redefine him today.

216
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,020
 So let's dive in, Colossians chapter one still.

217
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,620
 If you're just joining with us,

218
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,060
 this is a series we started last week.

219
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,220
 You came at a great time.

220
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,340
 If you're looking for it in your Bible,

221
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,900
 it's Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the Gospels,

222
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,380
 Acts, Romans, first and second Corinthians,

223
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,060
 Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians.

224
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,700
 So you don't need to be nervous if you pass it up

225
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,340
 or wondering if anybody's watching you

226
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,300
 and you don't know the Bible.

227
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,540
 It's okay, we're glad you're here.

228
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,100
 You can take time to find that.

229
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,980
 Verse 15.

230
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,820
 The son is the image of the invisible God,

231
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,740
 the firstborn over all creation.

232
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
 He begins to talk about Christ.

233
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,940
 And he's not saying that he looks like God physically,

234
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,180
 he is saying that he is the exact representation

235
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,140
 of God's character as he walked on this earth.

236
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,540
 If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus.

237
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,460
 If you want to know how God would handle the sick,

238
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,020
 look at how Jesus handled the sick.

239
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,900
 If you want to look at how God handles sinners,

240
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,560
 look at how Jesus handles sinners.

241
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,660
 This Jesus is the exact representation

242
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,140
 of the character of God,

243
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,140
 the visible image of the invisible God.

244
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,100
 And when it says firstborn over creation,

245
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,940
 that doesn't mean that Jesus was born first,

246
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,020
 as Jehovah's Witness might tell you.

247
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,080
 That means that that term firstborn

248
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,420
 is a term of inheritance to the Jewish culture

249
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,020
 that this was written to.

250
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,720
 It means that all of creation belongs to Jesus.

251
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,780
 The next line is actually going to give us that context.

252
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,580
 For in him all things were created,

253
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,980
 things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,

254
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,340
 whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities,

255
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,500
 all things have been created through him and for him.

256
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,700
 Everything you know was made by Jesus for Jesus.

257
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,280
 John 1 tells us that he was there in the beginning.

258
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,960
 He was not created.

259
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,340
 John 3:16 says that for he was God's only begotten,

260
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,920
 not born, not made son.

261
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,980
 That he is God.

262
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,320
 That he was there with God in the beginning,

263
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,680
 the beginning of the beginning,

264
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,920
 as we understand the beginning, he was there.

265
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,840
 And so anyone or anything that you're tempted to worship

266
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,200
 was made by Jesus for Jesus.

267
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,480
 Just imagine with me for a second,

268
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,900
 I don't know who you would get,

269
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,880
 it would be a big deal to me, you know, for you.

270
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,820
 You know, if you're out at dinner with someone

271
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,360
 and a celebrity walks up,

272
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,600
 I don't know who's a big deal to you.

273
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,680
 I don't know if it's Tony Romo

274
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,760
 or Prince William or something.

275
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,600
 I don't know, right?

276
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,900
 Who is a big deal?

277
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,440
 You're sitting there and maybe you would call your friends

278
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,280
 or post on Facebook,

279
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
 you won't believe what just happened to me.

280
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,460
 You won't believe who just paid my bill.

281
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,520
 Prince William walked up and he just paid the bill.

282
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,840
 It was a big, I was nervous.

283
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,000
 I couldn't even speak.

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
 I tried to speak and words didn't come out.

285
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,640
 I was sweating.

286
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,460
 I was like, are you serious?

287
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,960
 I can't believe you're here in Dallas.

288
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,520
 (congregation laughing)

289
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
 Check this out.

290
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,760
 The most powerful being in the entire universe

291
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,720
 paid your eternity, paid your bill for eternity.

292
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
 He desires to know you, he loves you.

293
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
 He's seeking you, he's pursuing you,

294
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,780
 and he's created you, he's invented you for a purpose.

295
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,360
 It's a bigger deal than anyone that you could imagine.

296
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,800
 Anyone you would meet was actually created by him.

297
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,200
 He knew Prince William in his mother's womb.

298
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,040
 He know how many hairs are on his head.

299
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,160
 A billion years ago, he knew Prince William.

300
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,360
 He is before all things and in him all things hold together.

301
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,940
 This is really relevant to the people of Colossae

302
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,800
 because there were a lot of earthquakes there

303
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,480
 and they were tempted to worship mother earth

304
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,160
 or mother nature, if you will.

305
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
 And so I remember when I went to Haiti

306
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,880
 just after the earthquake in Port-au-Prince,

307
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,080
 they said the entire nation began to turn to God

308
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,000
 because they said only God can shake the earth like this.

309
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,880
 It was just a layup to share the gospel.

310
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,980
 Hey, this is, you know, God is not shaken.

311
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,120
 In fact, God holds all things together.

312
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,360
 Can I tell you about who he is?

313
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
 And that's what he's writing here.

314
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,640
 And he is the head of the body, the church.

315
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
 This is why we write about membership

316
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,560
 or talk about membership so much here

317
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,080
 because we want you to belong to the church.

318
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,920
 In fact, the only way to be under Christ's authority

319
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,880
 is to be in his church and belong to his church.

320
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,720
 So you're here and you're wondering,

321
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
 hey, I wonder if I'm under Christ's authority.

322
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
 Well, do you belong to his church?

323
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,800
 Okay, that's step one of being under his authority

324
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,640
 after you've trusted him for the forgiveness of your sins.

325
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,500
 He is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead

326
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,800
 so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

327
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,320
 We don't use that word much, supremacy,

328
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,160
 but it's a huge word.

329
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,200
 In fact, this passage is often titled with it.

330
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,520
 And so do you guys remember born identity?

331
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,300
 Jason born and he kind of identifies himself as bad.

332
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,520
 And then born supremacy comes out and he is amazing.

333
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,680
 Like he's just showing off how bad he actually is.

334
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,560
 This is what's going on.

335
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,400
 God is bigger and better and badder and faster

336
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,420
 and more amazing than anything.

337
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,220
 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him.

338
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,480
 Paul is answering a question, a very important question

339
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
 that you're gonna have to answer tonight.

340
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,360
 Who is this man?

341
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,680
 This is a question that shows up all throughout scripture.

342
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
 Who is this man?

343
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
 Where everywhere Jesus would go, people were,

344
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,360
 it says in Matthew that when he came into a town,

345
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
 everyone was asking, who is this man?

346
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,520
 Remember in Mark four, when Jesus is with his boys

347
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,360
 and they're on a boat and he's sleeping

348
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,120
 and the storm comes and all of a sudden,

349
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,480
 all of these grown fishermen who have spent most

350
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,660
 of their life on the sea are terrified.

351
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,180
 These grown men are like afraid.

352
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,160
 They think they're gonna die,

353
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,920
 get thrown overboard and drown.

354
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,560
 And they go to Jesus and they wake him up

355
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,160
 and they say, how can you sleep at a time like this?

356
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,680
 Do you not care?

357
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,560
 And he gets up, he's like tired, hush.

358
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,520
 I would've told them to hush.

359
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,000
 You know, I would've been like, what are you talking about?

360
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
 But he just goes, hush.

361
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,420
 And the storm calms and you know what they ask?

362
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,860
 They say, who is this man that even the wind

363
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,060
 and waves obey him?

364
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,240
 This man is God.

365
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,040
 That's my first point, Jesus is God.

366
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,320
 Jesus is God.

367
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,800
 Jesus is the second person of the Trinity.

368
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,280
 And so I assume that, now I just lost some of you,

369
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,840
 but most of you are still with me.

370
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,240
 Most of you would agree, yeah, Jesus is God.

371
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,360
 And so we may have just lost a few people

372
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,340
 on that first point, but I think most of you

373
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,360
 are still with me right now.

374
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,240
 You're like, yeah, I think Jesus is God.

375
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,800
 It's a really basic concept of the Christian faith.

376
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,760
 This is something that we would break fellowship with.

377
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,320
 If somebody said, hey, I don't think Jesus is God,

378
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,240
 we'd say, hey, we can be friends, we can hang out,

379
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,760
 but we can't worship together

380
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,560
 because we're not worshiping the same God.

381
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,120
 You would say, hey, we can't get married.

382
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,440
 Like, I can't spend the rest of my life with you

383
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,920
 because 2 Corinthians 6, 14 says,

384
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,080
 do not be unequally yoked.

385
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,440
 And if I believe Jesus is God

386
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,980
 and you don't believe Jesus is God,

387
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,360
 we are certainly unequally yoked at this point.

388
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,920
 And so this is a really big idea.

389
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,800
 It is a huge idea that Jesus, we just identified God,

390
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,440
 the creator of the heavens and the earth, as Jesus.

391
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,760
 Now, some of you, you're like, duh, okay, Pastor Man,

392
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,240
 thank you for that huge, big, lofty idea,

393
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
 Jesus is God, great point there.

394
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,200
 Okay, but here's the deal.

395
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,520
 It's a big idea that we've become accustomed to

396
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
 that no longer has impact on our lives.

397
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,840
 Let me explain like this.

398
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,920
 There's a town near where I'm from called Luling,

399
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,160
 Luling, Texas, and anybody from Luling?

400
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,200
 Good, 'cause I'm about to offend you if you were.

401
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,900
 And so Luling smells awful.

402
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,740
 When you drive through it

403
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,400
 because of the oil and gas that's there,

404
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
 like, you can smell it from miles away

405
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,000
 and you pull in, and we used to play basketball there,

406
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,480
 and you're like, oh, how am I ever gonna be able

407
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,760
 to play basketball here?

408
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,000
 Like, that was our excuse for losing.

409
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,880
 We're like, oh, 'cause it stinks, right?

410
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,280
 And you're like, I could never ever live in this town,

411
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,380
 it smells so awful.

412
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,760
 But here's the deal.

413
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,080
 Within 30 minutes, you would get used to it

414
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,360
 and you would no longer think about it.

415
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,680
 And at one point in your life, Jesus is God was a huge idea.

416
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,700
 I just met God.

417
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,000
 God wants a relationship with me.

418
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,600
 And now it's like, duh, what does that even mean?

419
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,160
 Jesus is God, who cares?

420
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,720
 And so I don't know if you've been to Luling.

421
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,680
 Maybe you've been to Lubbock, I hear it's similar.

422
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,080
 But. (congregation laughing)

423
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:03,360
 I had family members that this was a big deal for.

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,240
 I mean, people who were really close to me said,

425
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
 man, I believe Jesus was God's son.

426
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
 I believe he was a way-shower.

427
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,340
 I believe he was an example.

428
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,600
 I don't think he was God.

429
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,880
 And so after I became a Christian,

430
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,480
 we'd have to sit and we'd have to talk through that.

431
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,920
 And by the grace of God, he's since changed their mind

432
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,080
 through years of conversation

433
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,200
 and a movement of his Holy Spirit.

434
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
 But this can be a big deal.

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,480
 I mean, this can really separate things.

436
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,920
 The world belongs to Jesus as God.

437
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,000
 Abraham Kuyper says this, one of my favorite quotes,

438
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
 says, "There is not a square inch in the whole domain

439
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,300
 "of our human existence over which Christ,

440
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,260
 "who is sovereign over all, does not cry out, mine."

441
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,960
 Every square inch of creation is his.

442
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,040
 Now this is like my son, Weston, my two and a half year old,

443
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,520
 everything is his, right?

444
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,400
 He's like, "Mine, mine, mine,"

445
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,160
 except for what Jesus actually is.

446
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,760
 When he says, "Mine," it's his.

447
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,220
 It was created by him and for him.

448
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,560
 And so he's not, doesn't just bear the image of God,

449
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,040
 he has the power of God, the fullness of his deity

450
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,120
 and dwells in Christ.

451
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,560
 So the other day we were praying at night

452
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,280
 with my little girls, Presley and Finley,

453
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,920
 and I said, "Presley, do you wanna pray?"

454
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
 And she said, "Yeah."

455
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
 And she started kinda playing, rolling her eyes,

456
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,560
 like, ♪ Dear God, dear God ♪

457
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,040
 And she's kinda singing, ♪ Dear God ♪

458
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,740
 And I said, "Hey, time out real quick, sweetie.

459
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,500
 "Hey, do you understand that you're talking

460
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,340
 "to the creator of the heavens and the earth?

461
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,640
 "Like, do you know that he could suck all the air

462
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,120
 "out of the room right now?

463
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,120
 "That in a moment, like just with a blink,"

464
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
 stay with me, stay with me.

465
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
 I said, "Just with the blink of his eyes,

466
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
 "he could kill you right now."

467
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
 (congregation laughing)

468
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,160
 I feel a lot of judgment going on.

469
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,960
 (congregation laughing)

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,280
 Most of you aren't parents, you don't know, it's hard, man.

471
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,960
 Sometimes stuff just comes out and you're like,

472
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,840
 "Okay, yeah, she didn't sleep that night, that's okay.

473
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,400
 "She has a better understanding of who God is."

474
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,880
 She literally, she was like.

475
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,920
 (congregation laughing)

476
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,820
 I said, "But he probably won't, it's okay.

477
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,160
 "He probably won't, he probably, you know,

478
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,660
 "he'll probably let you live."

479
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,720
 It's a humbling thing to realize that someone is powerful.

480
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,800
 Because when you realize the power of someone else,

481
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,760
 you understand your place.

482
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,320
 I mean, have you ever come across someone powerful?

483
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,600
 In my high school, there was this dude, he was 6'2".

484
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
 He was an incredible athlete.

485
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,320
 I mean, he could just monster dunk the ball.

486
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,920
 He played football, basketball, track, baseball, everything.

487
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,680
 He was that guy, and like his arm, he was 6'2",

488
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,960
 his arms were like my legs, like huge,

489
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
 just big arms, walk around.

490
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,360
 He was a nice guy, his name was Kiki.

491
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,760
 He had a gold grill.

492
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,120
 It said K-I-K-I right there.

493
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
 And it was known, I'm serious, it was known,

494
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,920
 Kiki was a friend, it was known you don't mess with Kiki.

495
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
 Like, Kiki would whoop anybody.

496
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,080
 It was just known throughout school.

497
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,560
 Like, he was king of the school, right?

498
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,440
 I remember one particular day, this guy had talked

499
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,400
 to his girlfriend or something,

500
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,560
 and he was a nice guy, by the way.

501
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
 He'd be like, "What's up, JP, how you doing, man?"

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,240
 He was just kind of, everybody loved Kiki.

503
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,040
 And so he, this guy had talked to his girlfriend,

504
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,320
 he came up to him, he said, "Hey, what's up?

505
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,480
 "We walked in the locker room, I remember."

506
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,320
 He said, "What's up?

507
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,160
 "Hey, what's up, man?

508
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,000
 "Hey, I saw you, you know, I heard you talking to my girl."

509
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,680
 And the guy was like, "Yeah?"

510
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,880
 And he goes, "Cool, man."

511
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,880
 Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

512
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,040
 Hey, anybody else wanna talk to my girl?

513
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,400
 (congregation laughing)

514
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,440
 Everybody was like, "Oh, man, what girl?"

515
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,160
 And so it was known that Kiki was a good wrestler.

516
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,680
 And so one time he was at my house,

517
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,120
 and I like to wrestle, and I said,

518
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,400
 I said, "Hey, man, I mean, you know,

519
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,520
 "I hear you're a good wrestler."

520
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,480
 I was like, "Let's wrestle."

521
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,800
 And he said, "Nah, bro, you don't wanna do that."

522
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,520
 (congregation laughing)

523
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,320
 And I said, "No, I think I do, let's wrestle."

524
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,480
 And I don't really know what happened, okay?

525
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,560
 (congregation laughing)

526
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,680
 But I remember somebody else being there,

527
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,240
 and they said, "Okay, go."

528
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,640
 And all of a sudden, he had me like this above his head,

529
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,280
 and then on the ground, and that's where I woke up.

530
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,240
 (congregation laughing)

531
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
 And it's a humble thing being there,

532
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,120
 and like, oh, oh, you're that powerful.

533
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,200
 Oh, like everything they said about you is true, all right?

534
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,040
 Now, I'm not, you know, God made Kiki in his mother's womb.

535
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,280
 Like, that's who we're talking about here.

536
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,600
 And there needs to be a moment

537
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,760
 where we understand his power in our place.

538
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,720
 He's God, we're not.

539
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,680
 He controls everything, we control nothing.

540
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,840
 All power and honor and glory is his.

541
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,600
 You can imagine if he wasn't a good God,

542
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,960
 that wouldn't be good for any of us.

543
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,520
 But the scripture says he's a great God,

544
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,320
 and he displayed his greatness in the gospel

545
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,000
 that while you were yet sinners, he gave his life for you.

546
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,720
 That's a beautiful, beautiful reality.

547
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,000
 In the same way that I wanted to be on Kiki's good side

548
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,280
 at that moment, we wanna be on God's good side,

549
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,880
 not out of threat or fear, but because he's a good God,

550
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,440
 but he's also a powerful God.

551
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,440
 And through him to reconcile to himself all things,

552
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,480
 whether things on earth or things in heaven,

553
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,260
 by making peace through his blood shed on the cross.

554
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,160
 Once you were alienated from God

555
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,720
 and were enemies in your minds

556
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
 because of your evil behavior,

557
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,880
 but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body

558
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,720
 through death to present you holy in his sight

559
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,000
 without blemish and free from accusation.

560
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,080
 That's good news.

561
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 And so Paul is answering the question, who is this man?

562
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
 Jesus, who is this man?

563
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,680
 And you may remember this story of these guys

564
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,560
 who had this friend who was paralyzed,

565
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,080
 and Jesus is healing people on the earth.

566
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,000
 And so they carry this man on a mat who can't walk,

567
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,520
 and they try to carry him up to Jesus,

568
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,600
 but the crowd is too dense, it's too thick.

569
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,560
 And so they climb up on top of the roof,

570
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,520
 and they lower him down in faith in front of Jesus.

571
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,320
 And do you know what Jesus says?

572
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,640
 He says, "Your sins are forgiven."

573
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,060
 And do you know what the Pharisees said?

574
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,200
 They said, "Who is this man?"

575
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,600
 That's the question.

576
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,160
 Who is this man that he thinks that he can forgive sins

577
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,640
 because only God can forgive sins?

578
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
 Now, we've already established Jesus is God,

579
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,480
 but not only is he God,

580
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,460
 he's the one who can forgive your sins, Jesus.

581
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,660
 My second point, Jesus is the Savior.

582
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,360
 Jesus is the Savior.

583
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,680
 Now, the group just got a little smaller,

584
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,320
 because by being the Savior, it means he's the way to God,

585
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,360
 and by being the way to God,

586
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,640
 it means he's the only way to God.

587
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,400
 Now we've become exclusive in nature,

588
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,120
 and this makes people uncomfortable.

589
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,080
 And so now I just lost some of the room.

590
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,240
 The room just got smaller.

591
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,640
 Like maybe we're just right about here,

592
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,600
 and everyone over there is like,

593
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,960
 "Yeah, I believe in Jesus, he's a good idea,

594
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,320
 "but don't say he's the only way 'cause that's offensive."

595
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,040
 Problem with that is that's what the Scripture says.

596
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,960
 That's what the Bible says.

597
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,160
 To reject that truth is to reject the entire book,

598
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,440
 and really to deny the gospel in and of itself.

599
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,740
 Because if God did, if there was another way,

600
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,000
 then God wasted his death.

601
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,380
 Like that was a foolish plan.

602
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,000
 If there's any other way to God,

603
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,960
 then I think the part where he goes and is tortured

604
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,700
 and crucified for my sins was really foolish.

605
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,080
 Should've went some other way, right?

606
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,940
 Like that seems really costly.

607
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,320
 But a loving God says, "No, that while you are yet sinners,

608
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,140
 "I did that for you because I love you

609
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,320
 "as an act of love for you."

610
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,160
 And so we've already established that God is powerful.

611
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,760
 So who is an enemy to a God that is that powerful?

612
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,400
 You were.

613
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,400
 Says you were his enemies.

614
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,840
 That you were alienated from him

615
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,240
 because of your evil behavior.

616
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,200
 And a lot of people read that and they're like,

617
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,340
 "Wait a minute, that's not talking about me.

618
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,400
 "Like come on, evil behavior.

619
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,860
 "I mean, I stole that pack of gum one time,

620
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,480
 "but really evil behavior."

621
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,440
 And the problem with that is if we don't understand

622
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,520
 our need for a savior, then we don't get a savior.

623
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
 Because only people who need a savior receive a savior,

624
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,200
 and Jesus is a savior, that's his job description.

625
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
 Really, we're just going down his resume right here, right?

626
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,880
 Creator of the heavens and the earth,

627
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,360
 visible image of the invisible God.

628
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,660
 I save people, that's what I do, I'm a savior.

629
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,500
 If we don't need a savior, then why would you need Jesus?

630
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,660
 It's talking about you and me here

631
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,360
 when it says by your evil, right?

632
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,760
 Let's see, once you were alienated from God

633
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,320
 and were enemies in your minds

634
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,360
 because of your evil behavior.

635
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,160
 Alienated from God literally means under another authority.

636
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,040
 Did you guys have ISS in high school, in school suspension?

637
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,800
 Yeah, me too, I spent some time there.

638
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,420
 And so it was like this other room, right?

639
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,480
 You would walk by, there was an outside corridor,

640
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,460
 and you would walk by and in that room,

641
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,960
 those were the guys who were alienated

642
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,100
 from the rest of the good people.

643
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,160
 They were the people who said,

644
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,760
 "Hey, we will not be under the authority of the school."

645
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,280
 And they made decisions that got them in another room.

646
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,960
 In fact, it was like, "Hey, you won't be here long.

647
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,120
 "We know it's only a matter of time

648
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,980
 "before you're shipped off somewhere else

649
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,620
 "and you won't graduate with us.

650
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,640
 "You've been alienated, you've been separated."

651
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,480
 Once you were separated from God

652
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,380
 and Jesus had to purchase you back.

653
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,840
 See, God can make peace.

654
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,860
 It says he's made peace by bloodshed on his cross.

655
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,260
 God can make peace in two ways.

656
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,700
 There's two ways to make peace with your enemies.

657
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,840
 One, you can abolish them, right?

658
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,160
 You can just wipe them out.

659
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,360
 They no longer exist, they're not your enemies anymore.

660
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,700
 They don't exist.

661
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,140
 In other words, you can make them your friends.

662
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,220
 God prefers that method.

663
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,860
 It says in the scriptures really clearly,

664
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,580
 God loves you so much that while you were an enemy,

665
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,420
 he attempted to make you a friend

666
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,740
 by giving his own life on behalf of you.

667
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,480
 That happened in an event that really

668
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
 the whole world acknowledges that it happened,

669
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,280
 that Jesus died.

670
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,080
 That something really significant happened on the cross.

671
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,220
 And God says, "Hey, I wanna bring peace to this earth

672
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,940
 "and reconcile all things by one of two ways,

673
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,960
 "by making my enemies friends or by wiping them out,

674
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,500
 "but I'd certainly prefer the first way.

675
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,660
 "But I will make peace.

676
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,100
 "Peace will be made."

677
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,600
 And so Jesus' skills and capabilities are simply

678
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,000
 he makes God not angry.

679
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,280
 I mean, the gospel, it's another one of those big ideas

680
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,080
 we just kinda get accustomed to.

681
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,600
 I mean, do you guys realize what the gospel says?

682
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,040
 Can you imagine just the weight of this,

683
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,620
 that God's son died on your behalf,

684
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,160
 that he endured the punishment that you deserve?

685
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,020
 Like, let's just imagine this with me for a second.

686
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,860
 Like, I'm driving down the road in my truck

687
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,700
 with my son Weston.

688
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,760
 Weston loves my truck.

689
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,520
 He's always like, "Daddy's truck, let's go for a ride."

690
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,280
 He's two and a half years old, he's in the back.

691
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,920
 I'm driving down the road and let's just say,

692
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,160
 "You run a red light, you hit my truck."

693
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,960
 Now, let's just say, because I love my truck

694
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,240
 and let's just say I'm really materialistic

695
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,640
 and I'm not in the spirit in this moment.

696
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,960
 And so I'm like burning with anger towards you.

697
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,560
 Like, I'm about to go kiki on you, right?

698
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,400
 And so I get out of the car and I grab my son Weston

699
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
 and I look at you and my anger towards you

700
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,640
 and I just start beating him.

701
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,120
 Graphic, huh?

702
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,080
 It ain't nearly as graphic as what happened on your behalf.

703
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,440
 That Jesus absorbed the wrath of the Father on the cross.

704
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,320
 Every sin you've ever committed was against God.

705
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,400
 Every time, you slept with his daughter, right?

706
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,520
 You looked at his daughter, right?

707
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,680
 You purchased idols in front of him.

708
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,800
 That time you abused your body in that way,

709
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,320
 that wasn't a sin against yourself,

710
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
 it was a sin against God Almighty,

711
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,760
 creator of the heavens and the earth.

712
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,800
 And he hates your sin, but he loves you so much.

713
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,560
 He says, "Jesus will die in your place."

714
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,760
 Now, the illustration breaks down because it's not just that,

715
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,280
 it's that it says, "Jesus,"

716
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,160
 this is the complication of the Trinity,

717
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,080
 "that Jesus himself is God."

718
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,120
 And so it's like he runs in between the vehicles,

719
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,640
 absorbs the wrath of this car

720
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,440
 so that I'm no longer angry, right?

721
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,440
 (congregation laughing)

722
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,560
 But it says that he does that

723
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,440
 for every sin you've ever committed,

724
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,280
 that he absorbed the wrath of the Father,

725
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,080
 God's anger at your sin on your behalf,

726
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,400
 past, present, and future,

727
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,560
 so that you might be a child of God,

728
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,160
 so that you might be reconciled to the Father,

729
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,960
 with him forever in peace,

730
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
 that his anger is not at you,

731
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,960
 that his anger was satisfied fully

732
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,240
 by Christ's blood shed on the cross.

733
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,600
 It says, "For the joy set before him, Jesus did this."

734
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,880
 God is in love with you,

735
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,600
 that while you were an enemy, he died for you.

736
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:59,040
 "If you continue in your faith, established and firm,

737
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,160
 "and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel,"

738
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,280
 we hate that if, it feels conditional,

739
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,980
 it's like, okay, here we go, now I gotta do something.

740
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,400
 I wanna show you what that if is pointing to.

741
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,760
 It's the last word in that sentence,

742
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,720
 "If you continue in your faith, established and firm,

743
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 "and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel."

744
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,640
 This is not a if you do if,

745
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,400
 this is an if you believe if.

746
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,860
 But if you believe, you do.

747
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,280
 Do you track it with me?

748
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,200
 This if here, it's not an if you do,

749
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,400
 like, here's what I want you to do

750
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,160
 so that you can be reconciled to God.

751
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,720
 This is a, here's what you believe,

752
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,800
 you hold out to the hope that is held out for you

753
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,640
 in the gospel.

754
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,460
 What is the gospel?

755
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,720
 The gospel is that God saved you in spite of you,

756
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,680
 that against your will, God took you in,

757
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,760
 that while you were yet enemies of God, he died for you.

758
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,760
 Christ, Jesus, died for you in spite of you.

759
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,680
 For it is by grace you have been saved through faith,

760
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,720
 and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,

761
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,480
 not by works so that no one can boast.

762
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,240
 This is the gospel that you heard

763
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,320
 and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven

764
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,980
 and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.

765
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,080
 What I want you to do there

766
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
 is I want you to write your name in that blank.

767
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,760
 Of which I, blank, have become a servant.

768
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,960
 Go Taylor Swift on 'em.

769
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,480
 Of which I, JP, have become a servant.

770
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,280
 My third and final point is Jesus is Lord

771
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,600
 and we are his servants.

772
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,400
 Jesus is Lord and we are his servants.

773
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,640
 He is our master.

774
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,700
 Man, I just lost a lot of you.

775
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,200
 You tracking with me?

776
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,520
 Jesus is God, sure, okay.

777
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,880
 Jesus is Savior, sure, fire insurance,

778
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
 I don't wanna go to hell, he's my Savior.

779
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,040
 Jesus is master.

780
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,400
 You don't go where he doesn't send you.

781
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,280
 He's driving, you're not driving.

782
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,840
 He's your master, he's your Lord.

783
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,580
 Now I'm not talking about Lordship salvation,

784
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,280
 if you're familiar with that term.

785
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,120
 I'm not saying that you're saved if Jesus is Lord.

786
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,440
 You're saved by what Jesus did, that's a fact.

787
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,460
 But you will not experience life on this earth

788
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,240
 as it was intended to be experienced

789
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,360
 if Jesus is not Lord of your life.

790
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,760
 If you are not his servant, if he's not in control,

791
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,960
 if you're fighting an almighty, powerful God for control,

792
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,000
 then you're really gonna struggle in this life.

793
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,680
 Life is going to be very, very difficult for you

794
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,080
 and you will not experience Christianity

795
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,960
 as it was intended to be experienced.

796
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,400
 And I can tell you that from experience.

797
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,580
 I mean, that's my story.

798
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,760
 When I came to a place where I knew Christ,

799
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,100
 there were things I was holding onto.

800
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,680
 There was the language and the pornography

801
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,400
 and the sex and the drinking that I didn't wanna give up.

802
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,600
 The getting drunk, the partying

803
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,920
 that I didn't wanna give up.

804
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,640
 The materialism that I didn't wanna give up.

805
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,560
 And have a foot in both worlds, which is miserable.

806
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,840
 You lose out on both worlds.

807
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,400
 One foot in the church, one foot in the world.

808
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,240
 Not getting the best from either.

809
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,000
 And so Jesus is Lord and we are his servants.

810
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,840
 He is our master.

811
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,840
 This is Paul's DTR, right?

812
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,200
 He's defining the relationship.

813
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,680
 Are you familiar with that term, DTR?

814
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,880
 Define the relationship.

815
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,400
 You ever done that?

816
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,720
 Is it not a game changer?

817
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,720
 Like in the midst of spending time with someone.

818
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,560
 Like you have this conversation.

819
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
 I mean, do you remember, has that ever happened to you?

820
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,360
 Like you're sitting there and it's like,

821
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
 hey, I wanna talk to you about something.

822
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,520
 I remember Ann Marie back in the day,

823
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,600
 like her hands right here, my hands here.

824
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,760
 You're kind of like slowly inching over that pinky.

825
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,640
 You know, I'm sweaty.

826
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,600
 I'm like, oh man, I'm nervous.

827
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,040
 Like, hey girl, thought I had game.

828
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,320
 You know, I'm like, so everybody's asking what we are.

829
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,480
 (congregation laughing)

830
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,080
 Man, I think we need to figure that out.

831
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,200
 Let's give the people what they want, you know.

832
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
 (congregation laughing)

833
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
 Before that it was like check yes or no.

834
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,680
 Now I remember Kelly crawled over the console in my car.

835
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,960
 She's like, hey, I love you.

836
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,720
 I was like, thank you.

837
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,160
 (congregation laughing)

838
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,040
 Those conversations, they go,

839
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,920
 they take you separate ways, right?

840
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,400
 That like, that takes you one way or another way.

841
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,760
 Like, okay, one minute, like it's like,

842
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,840
 hey, we may be close and in relationship

843
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,520
 and it may go really well or it may be over.

844
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,640
 Or it's like, hey, can we just be friends?

845
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,400
 Just wanna be friends.

846
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:52,480
 I had a DTR once with a woman who I love very, very much.

847
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,360
 Was down on one knee.

848
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,360
 Will you spend the rest of your life with me?

849
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,400
 Remember I asked her.

850
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,760
 She said yes, I remember I was so happy.

851
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,280
 And it honestly, it got closer.

852
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,720
 I thought about this passage because I wrote her a song

853
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,240
 and I'm gonna sing it now.

854
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,320
 No, I'm not gonna sing it.

855
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,120
 (congregation laughing)

856
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,440
 I'm just kidding, I'm not.

857
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,400
 Felt heavy, Andy's playing in the back.

858
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,240
 Anyway.

859
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,000
 I wrote her a song and in the song,

860
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,160
 I listened to it today.

861
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,200
 In the song, it just said all these crazy things.

862
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,480
 Like, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

863
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,080
 I wanna make you happy.

864
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,400
 I thank Jesus for you.

865
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,240
 You're a gift from God into my life.

866
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,440
 I'm so thrilled that all that's gonna happen on this day

867
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,960
 and we danced to it at our wedding, that song.

868
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,400
 A friend, we went to a recording studio and re-recorded it

869
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,040
 and that song in and of itself was a DTR.

870
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,840
 And I remember the joy that I had in writing that song

871
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,400
 and all the meaning that it had.

872
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,760
 You know, this week, I mean, we've been married

873
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,800
 over 10 years and we've got three kids and life happens.

874
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,960
 And it was a hard week.

875
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,880
 My little girl Finley, she's got strep throat.

876
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,680
 And so we went basically two nights without sleep.

877
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,560
 And that really big idea

878
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,120
 that I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.

879
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,640
 It became very practical.

880
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,000
 Like survival mode, like, yeah, of course,

881
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,600
 I'm gonna get home and you're gonna be there

882
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
 'cause you're always there.

883
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,800
 And of course, like, you know, we just agree.

884
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,520
 And you know what, yesterday I was just an idiot.

885
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,160
 I was just an idiot to her.

886
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,280
 I was mean, I was rude.

887
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,640
 I totally took her for granted and took advantage of her

888
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,000
 because I know she'll always be there.

889
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,280
 She promised me she would.

890
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,960
 She defined the relationship that she would always be there.

891
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,400
 And so I no longer poured into it.

892
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
 I no longer cherished her.

893
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,000
 I no longer invested in her.

894
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,200
 And it's interesting because when I do those things,

895
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,520
 when I invest in her and I pour into her and I cherish her,

896
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,760
 man, it is a ton of fun.

897
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
 And we love each other and we laugh.

898
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,000
 We laugh until we cry and talk for a long time.

899
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,080
 But when I take her for granted,

900
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,480
 there's this sense that, you know, that she's not my wife,

901
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,520
 that she's just kind of a housekeeper

902
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,080
 or childcare for our children or a prostitute

903
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,000
 that I would take from her pleasure.

904
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,120
 But she's none of those things.

905
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,040
 She's my wife.

906
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,840
 She's my wife.

907
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,120
 And I'm telling you, Jesus doesn't wanna be anything to you

908
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:42,120
 other than God, Savior, and Lord, master of your life.

909
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,200
 And you won't experience life

910
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,600
 as it was meant to be experienced

911
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,160
 until he's master of your life.

912
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,000
 Until you're not going anywhere, he's not sending you.

913
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,360
 Until you're not pursuing and investing in that relationship

914
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,040
 and pouring into him and enjoying him,

915
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,440
 not out of obligation, not like,

916
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,220
 oh, I gotta read this book that doesn't make sense.

917
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,840
 But no, I wanna know you, God.

918
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,440
 Jesus, I want you to be king.

919
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,720
 I've had this amazing front row seat

920
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,120
 of watching God change lives

921
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,820
 as people have made that decision.

922
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,620
 And tonight is time for you to define the relationship.

923
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,160
 This is what Jesus is asking you to do.

924
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,800
 Through this text, the apostle Paul is saying,

925
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,520
 hey, I want you to define the relationship.

926
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,240
 Who is Jesus to you?

927
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,480
 Is he God and Savior, but not Lord?

928
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,400
 Is he God, but not Savior?

929
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,600
 He said, hey, bro.

930
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,360
 Hey, friend, hey, daughter of mine.

931
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,200
 I want to be to you God, Savior, and Lord.

932
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,900
 All right, let me pray and we'll move to worship.

933
00:38:49,900 --> 00:39:05,240
 Jesus, you have supremacy.

934
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,240
 You have authority over your people.

935
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,240
 You have authority over your nation.

936
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:22,240
 Jesus, take supremacy in our lives.

937
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,560
 Remove the idols that we've brought before you,

938
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,280
 the things that we've pursued supremacy for,

939
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,280
 and let us be worthy of your love.

940
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,280
 Jesus, you are worthy of our affection.

941
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,120
 You are worthy of anything that we could give you.

942
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,120
 You are God and we are not.

943
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,120
 We worship you now.

944
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,520
 This past weekend, Monica and I got away with some friends

945
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
 and he is a dear friend of mine, honestly,

946
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,840
 and I weigh these words carefully.

947
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,520
 He's the most gifted pastor I know,

948
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,680
 and by pastor, I mean lover of people.

949
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,120
 He cares for people.

950
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,080
 He always is interruptible.

951
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,040
 He stops and he'll go and visit folks in the hospital,

952
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,560
 and he's just really one of the kindest people I know,

953
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,080
 so much so, and I really know him.

954
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,000
 That's not just like something I read in a magazine.

955
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,320
 I mean, if Monica and I die,

956
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,780
 this guy and his wife actually get our children.

957
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,920
 He's in our will.

958
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,920
 And he was sharing his story, and it's a crazy story.

959
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,440
 I mean, and the story is a failed marriage, adultery affair,

960
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,080
 alcoholism, cocaine use.

961
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,120
 Literally, he paid homeless people

962
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,240
 to sit and drink with him.

963
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,520
 There's a suicide attempt in there.

964
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,640
 There was one day where he just went in his house

965
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,720
 and just tore everything up and threw paint on it

966
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,520
 and took a knife and ripped the cushions,

967
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,600
 and just like, it talks about rage

968
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,680
 and all of this crazy stuff,

969
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,520
 and the contrast couldn't be any bigger.

970
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,760
 For anyone who knows him, it's like,

971
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,920
 man, you are the kindest person I've ever met

972
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,240
 in my entire life, and I know you,

973
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,160
 and you sound like one of the most wicked, evil people

974
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,240
 I've ever even heard of, you know?

975
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,760
 And I'm just like, what changed?

976
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,120
 And he said this, and I wrote it down

977
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,160
 so I could share it with you.

978
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,560
 He said, "I came to a place where I realized

979
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,960
 "I don't have to be in charge.

980
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,060
 "Jesus is in charge.

981
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,620
 "He has a plan for my life, and it's a good plan."

982
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,100
 And within six months of saying that,

983
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,460
 he was in vocational ministry.

984
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,060
 Six months after, six months earlier

985
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,060
 from being in vocational ministry,

986
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,620
 he literally was on Sixth Street

987
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,060
 paying homeless people to drink with him

988
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,780
 with $600 bar tabs, completely given to alcohol and drugs.

989
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,380
 And now he's been a minister of the gospel

990
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,180
 for so many years, and I just,

991
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,700
 he came to the realization that I don't have to be in charge.

992
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,540
 Jesus is in charge.

993
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,820
 He has a plan for my life, and it is a good plan.

994
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,660
 That's what I'm saying.

995
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,260
 When I talk about Jesus being Lord of your life,

996
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,940
 I'm not talking about you getting to heaven.

997
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,540
 I'm talking about you experiencing life on this earth

998
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,720
 as it was intended to experience,

999
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,460
 because when you start saying, hey, I'll follow Jesus,

1000
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,720
 but I just, right now, I just love sex too much,

1001
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,580
 or right now, I like to spend my money in these ways,

1002
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,860
 or right now, I just love to listen to this music,

1003
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,560
 or whatever that is for you, like silly things, right?

1004
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,060
 Those are, that's supremacy talk.

1005
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,300
 Like, hey, I'll follow Jesus one day.

1006
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,340
 I just want this to happen first.

1007
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,020
 After I get married, you know, then I'll follow Christ.

1008
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,100
 That's supremacy talk.

1009
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,180
 All that means is you're not gonna experience life

1010
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,420
 until then, as it was intended to experience.

1011
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,380
 That's it.

1012
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,380
 Here's the reality.

1013
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,700
 As much as I hate to admit it,

1014
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,240
 the people who made that dress have come back

1015
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,520
 and said it is blue and black indeed, right?

1016
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,300
 [congregation applauding]

1017
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,160
 There's an absolute truth behind that opinion.

1018
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,600
 I mean, there's a reality, there's a hard,

1019
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,180
 Jesus can be whoever you invent him to be.

1020
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,140
 You can say he's a good prophet, or a good teacher,

1021
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,420
 or an idea, or your friend, or someone that you're gonna call

1022
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,220
 if you ever need, you're gonna shoot up a flare,

1023
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,000
 and hopefully, Jesus will come to your rescue,

1024
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,940
 but Jesus is Lord, and one day,

1025
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:15,580
 every single person who has ever lived

1026
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,900
 will know that Jesus is Lord.

1027
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,900
 Every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess,

1028
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:29,280
 either in submission or by force.

1029
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,980
 We'll all know one day.

1030
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,340
 That's why I say that with the assurance, the authority,

1031
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,900
 that everyone here will know one day Jesus is Lord.

1032
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,380
 He wants you to define the relationship tonight.
