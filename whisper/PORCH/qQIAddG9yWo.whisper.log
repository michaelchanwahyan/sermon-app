[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:28.640]   Porsche, how we doing?
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.280]   We doing good?
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.080]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.200]   Come on, come on, come on.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.640]   Hey, it's Thanksgiving week.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280]   I don't know if you're out of work yet,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.480]   but work is going to be coming to an end, which
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.480]   is nice for those of you that are gainfully employed.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.520]   Hey, listen, my name's Kylin.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.840]   I was here a little while ago.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.360]   TA did a little bit of an intro for me.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.360]   But listen, I love Dallas, Texas, so much so
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.920]   that I married someone from here.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   I had to have a piece of this city with me every day
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.980]   of my life for the rest of my life.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.280]   She's sitting right over here.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.440]   Everybody say, hi, Brooke.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.360]   Hi, Brooke.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.640]   She really is the best thing in my life.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.400]   Get to know her whenever you get a chance.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.200]   Hey, I'm excited for tonight.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.520]   It's crazy.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.440]   I wasn't planning to say this, but just the way
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.400]   the evening has crafted together is so very clearly
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.640]   from the Lord.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.140]   You'll have to take my word for it,
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.760]   because there's a lot that's gone into preparing this talk
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.720]   and visiting with this team and getting ready for this night
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.800]   that God just affirmed for me individually.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.440]   And what I saw over the course of our worship set
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.400]   was this team lead in places that I hadn't previously
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   informed them we would be going.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.120]   And so here's what I want you to know from the very beginning
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.620]   of the night.
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.520]   I want you to know this.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.760]   The Lord is here tonight.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.440]   And so I don't know if you intended
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.160]   to be here this evening or if someone kind of drug you
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.400]   into it unknowingly or if you're here looking
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.440]   for that certain someone.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.960]   I don't know what you may be here for.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880]   But I know that God has brought you here
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.800]   for a very specific reason.
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.880]   And it's that he wants to meet with you,
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.060]   that the presence of the living God
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.120]   is here at the porch tonight.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.760]   So with that said, I want to lead off with a question.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.520]   And I want you to ponder this to yourself.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.040]   And then I'll share a story and show you where we're going.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.720]   Is your experience of God as wonderful
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   as you've heard him to be?
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.000]   That's rhetorical.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.400]   Is your experience of God as wonderful
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.240]   as you've heard him to be?
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.280]   A couple of years ago, my wife Brooke and I,
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.560]   we made a trip to Italy.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160]   And while we were in Italy, we went to Rome.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.360]   And there's a bunch of different things you can do in Rome,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.280]   so many different things that you can fill up
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.160]   your itinerary with.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.440]   But there was one non-negotiable we had to do,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.880]   one thing that I asserted myself and made sure
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   we checked out, which was the Roman Colosseum.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.960]   Anybody seen the Roman Colosseum in here before?
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.160]   Show of hands.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.140]   Yes, I don't know if you know this,
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.320]   but the Roman Colosseum, it was recently listed
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.040]   on the New Seven Wonders of the World.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.720]   It was voted on by millions of people all across the globe,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.940]   and it came in second place.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.640]   And so I knew, man, we're going to be there,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.440]   and I've got to see this thing for myself.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.280]   I have heard the stories, I have read the books,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.960]   I've seen Russell Crowe fight his way out of it
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.440]   and into his freedom through the movie "Gladiator."
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.160]   We've got to go check it out.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.080]   But I didn't just want to visit the Colosseum.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.480]   I wanted to experience the Colosseum.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   I wanted to maximize my enjoyment of it.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.440]   And so I knew I'm not just going to pick up a ticket
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.040]   and kind of meander my way through its hallways.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.240]   No, what I want is I want a certified tour guide,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.200]   someone that is so obsessed with this place
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.760]   that they have committed their life to learning about it.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.480]   And so we did that.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.440]   We found a young man from Italy named Vincenzo.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.640]   He was not from Rome, but he had moved to Rome
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.920]   so that way he could specialize in its archeology.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.520]   He wanted to give his life to this place,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.120]   which is exactly what I was looking for.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.480]   So the day comes and I am jazzed up.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   I am ready.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.020]   And so we show up and nothing goes the way
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.160]   that we expected it to.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.320]   Like it was supposed to be beautiful outside.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.120]   It was forecasted to be a great day.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.820]   And then we swing open the cab door and it is pouring rain.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.880]   We make our way over to our tour group.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.440]   And I thought we were going to be amongst a small group
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.740]   of specifically invested learners,
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.020]   but we were like a herd of cattle, shoulder to shoulder,
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.480]   clamoring amongst this giant amphitheater.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.320]   And not only were we just listed
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.840]   amongst a bunch of different people,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.960]   but we were put in such a large group
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.280]   that I couldn't ask the questions that I prepared.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.840]   Like I came wanting to learn about this place.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.200]   So I couldn't get the sort of insight from Vincenzo
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.760]   that I was paying good money for him to share with me.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   And then lastly, Vincenzo,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.240]   this historian that was supposed to blow my mind,
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.680]   just spent a couple of hours talking
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.320]   about the various different kinds of marble
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.660]   that you'll find throughout the Colosseum.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.720]   You see, I had such great expectations
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.120]   of what would happen at the Colosseum,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.980]   but my experience was underwhelming.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.920]   It's this wonder of the world,
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.060]   but it just left me wondering
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.960]   where the nearest gelato shop was.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.100]   I share this with you for this reason.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.720]   Did my individual experience of the Colosseum
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.080]   invalidate that the Colosseum doesn't deserve
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.920]   to be listed amongst the new seven wonders of the world?
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.960]   No, of course not.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.660]   No, it is amazing.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.880]   But despite the fact that I showed up
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.560]   and I gave my best effort
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.600]   towards enjoying it for all that it was,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.840]   I found it to be underwhelming.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.320]   It wasn't wonderful to me, but that didn't mean
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.440]   it wasn't in fact as wonderful as the world,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.880]   literally the globe had deemed it to be identified as.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.400]   In the same way, so many of us,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.480]   we have failed to experience the one true wonder
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.240]   of the world, which is God,
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.120]   in a way that lives up to our expectations.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.320]   We even do everything we know we're supposed to.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.640]   We show up to church and we read our Bible
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.800]   and we lift our hands during worship
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.040]   and we show up to community group
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.440]   and we engage in Bible study and we confess our sins
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.000]   and we do our best.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.040]   Like we show up and we give our utmost.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.240]   And yet we find that no matter how hard we try,
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.320]   it just still feels underwhelming.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.580]   Why is it so hard?
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.840]   I have sat with so many young adults, just like you,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.040]   that are wondering, "Kylin, I've done everything.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.920]   I've tried to run all the right plays,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   and yet it's just underwhelming for me.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.160]   God's not as wonderful as everybody claims him to be."
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.760]   So what's your experience of him?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.280]   Is your experience of God as wonderful
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.200]   as you've heard him to be?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   If your answer to that question is, "Honestly, no,"
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.680]   then tonight's for you.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.280]   I want to answer why God is truly wonderful
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.520]   and how you can experience him for who he is.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.680]   And the way that we'll do that,
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.800]   as we get into a passage that the Apostle Paul speaks from,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.040]   is we're gonna see it's through
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.440]   what I would claim to be the most essential,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.900]   like the most fundamental aspect of the Christian life,
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.340]   which is prayer.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.800]   Prayer, you know, that thing that you,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.840]   like you cursorily say that you're gonna do for people
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.080]   when you're not really sure how to help them out.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.920]   Man, that sounds super hard.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.120]   I'll be praying for you.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.860]   But then you may not in fact actually do so.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.760]   Or it's the thing that you do
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.960]   whenever you show up with a group of friends
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.280]   and you sit around a dinner table and,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   "Hold on guys, before we eat,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.000]   we need to do the right thing.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.480]   We need to pray to God and bless the food,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.980]   even though we don't know what in fact we're doing.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.800]   How am I blessing this food?
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.360]   I don't know how to impart such powers
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.840]   to the bread on the table, right?"
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.360]   Or it's the thing, it's the last ditch Hail Mary pass.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.800]   We heave whenever we've walked out of that interview
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.560]   and we're not sure how they feel about us,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.400]   or we sent that text message and we see the dots
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.720]   and we're not sure what are they gonna say,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.960]   if they're gonna say anything,
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.920]   or it's the thing we feel whenever we know,
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.040]   like, "Man, Thanksgiving's coming up
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.080]   and I've got to see those people in my family."
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   We pray, right?
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.000]   You see, prayer is a frequented
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.960]   and familiar part of the human experience.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.520]   Data from Pew Research Center shows
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.320]   that almost half of US adults,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.160]   half of US adults, as broadly as we can describe it,
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   half, almost half of US adults say they pray daily,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.520]   despite the fact that we live in a post-Christian America.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.240]   Gallup Research reveals that more Americans
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.560]   will pray in a given week than will exercise,
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.060]   drive a car, have sex, or go to work.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.760]   Everybody prays.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   Everybody, across religions, across the globe,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400]   no matter your socioeconomic status,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.880]   every single person prays.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   It doesn't matter where you come from.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.800]   It doesn't matter really what you believe.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.440]   Across religions, even the most staunch atheist
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.060]   has lifted a half-hearted prayer
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.080]   in a moment of deep need and hurt.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.200]   You see, under the hood of humanity
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.040]   is this instinctive inclination to pray
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.080]   whenever times get tough.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.860]   This is true for everyone.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.400]   So here is the question for you tonight.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.580]   Why don't we enjoy it?
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.340]   Like, if it's built into me, why don't I enjoy this?
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.640]   Why isn't it more life-giving?
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.560]   Well, I think a lot can be said about this,
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   but we've only got a little bit of time together,
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.840]   so I'm gonna boil it down to one idea,
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.720]   and then we're gonna work through that idea together.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   But I would say this is why we don't enjoy it.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   We do not enjoy prayer because we don't think it works.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.280]   We're not convinced it works.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.580]   We're convinced it's boring and it's obligatory
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.880]   and it's customary and it's even confusing,
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.160]   but we're not sure it's actually effective.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.180]   It stands in contrast to other varying aspects
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.940]   of the Christian experience that are immediately gratifying.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.160]   Like, if you sit down in the morning and you read your Bible,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.440]   you may not enjoy the experience, I pray you do,
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.080]   but you may in fact learn something.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.600]   Like, there's an opportunity for you to walk away
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.780]   and be like, man, that's an idea that I didn't have.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.360]   There's an opportunity for gratification in that moment.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.880]   When you fast, you walk away hungry.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.400]   Your body lets you know, this is working.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.680]   Whenever you show up to church
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.620]   and you confess your sins to one another,
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.960]   there's a sense of relief that happens
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.520]   as you divulge the worst parts of yourself
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.200]   and you find amongst the body of Christ
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.920]   people that look at you and say,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.240]   we love you and we're still for you.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.520]   Yet prayer is different than all of these
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.260]   because prayer is not immediately gratifying.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.880]   It doesn't offer you immediate results.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.880]   You lift up prayers and you hope to God he hears,
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.000]   and I guess I'll wait and see.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.800]   This is our experience with prayer,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.460]   which is why so many of us have lost the desire for it.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.640]   Which brings me to my second question.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.280]   Why should we even desire it if this is the case?
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   Why is this something worth pursuing?
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.520]   Because I think it's through prayer
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.600]   that you actually experience God
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.740]   to be as wonderful as you've heard him to be.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.800]   That's what the Apostle Paul is gonna tell us
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.280]   in the book of Philippians.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   If you have a Bible,
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.940]   you can turn with me to Philippians chapter four.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.520]   If you don't, don't worry about it.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.800]   Scripture is gonna be on the screen.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.280]   We'll read through it together.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.220]   But here's what I need to say
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.240]   as you're turning to this passage.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.160]   This is going to be, if you've grown up in the church,
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.880]   a very familiar text.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.920]   It's gonna be one that you've turned to
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.960]   in moments of great anxiety,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.160]   in times when stress has felt heavy.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.920]   And while this passage says so much
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.720]   for the sake of your anxiety relief,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.400]   I think this passage is actually speaking so much more
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.440]   that I'm looking forward to us getting into.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.420]   So here's what it says.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.320]   It says this in Philippians chapter four,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.880]   and we're gonna pick it up in 5B,
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.800]   which is going to be the second half of verse five.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.280]   So when it pops up, you'll see it highlighted there,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.760]   but this is what it says.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.560]   The Lord is at hand.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.920]   Do not be anxious about anything,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.600]   but in everything, by prayer and supplication,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.880]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.840]   So let me just ask, how does that verse leave you feeling?
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.680]   Does that feel sensible?
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.320]   Does it feel frustrating?
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.720]   I know for myself, as a young man,
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.280]   when I would read this verse in specific,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.160]   it felt frustratingly ridiculous.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.640]   Thanks, Paul.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.560]   Man, I'm dealing with a lot right now,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.880]   and I was hoping to maybe get some practical insights
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.320]   and steps I could take in order to get out of this situation,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.160]   but you're right.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.800]   I'll just pray about it, and we'll see how that goes.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.280]   If that is your reaction to this verse,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   then just know that's not an uncommon response
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.800]   to this verse, and yet there's an explanation
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.080]   for why you may in fact be misreading this.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.000]   You see, so often when we come to this passage,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.760]   we start in verse six, which is a command from Paul.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.800]   Do not be anxious.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.320]   Hey, I know things are hard.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.640]   Suck it up.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.720]   You're gonna be okay.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.600]   Just pray about it.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.560]   Just talk to the Lord.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.680]   You're gonna make it out all right.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.120]   Like that's the way we read it,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.840]   and yet here's what you need to know.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.000]   Verse six is an imperative statement.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.760]   It is a command, but it's preceded
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.760]   by an indicative statement, a statement of fact.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.200]   Paul wants you to know, hey, there is something
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.140]   that is true, and as a result of that truth,
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.280]   you then do these things.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.600]   So what is he saying?
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:24.560]   He's saying, hey, the Lord is at hand.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.400]   Some versions say the Lord is near.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.220]   So don't be anxious.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.360]   God's here.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.440]   Don't worry about it.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.620]   He's close by.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   Talk to him about it.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.600]   Go visit with him.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.000]   Like this is an amazing truth for us to know
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.680]   that prayer is the passage to God's presence.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.520]   Like that's what Paul's trying to communicate to you.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.480]   If you wanna come into the presence of God,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.440]   this is the way you do it.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.280]   You talk to him.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.100]   You pray to him.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.640]   That's how you get close.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.080]   Like God, he is always available.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.520]   His door is open.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.160]   He's got time on the calendar.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.560]   You're never bothering him.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.240]   He's not too busy for you.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.200]   Like when you come to him and you pray,
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.880]   you literally are crossing heaven's threshold,
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.800]   and you get to engage with the living God.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.560]   You get to meet in his presence.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.320]   Prayer is the passage to that place.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.160]   That's why Paul is echoing the words of David
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   from Psalm 145.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.520]   Psalm 145, 18 says, "The Lord is near to all."
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.000]   To who?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.880]   To everybody.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.760]   Like non-discriminatorily.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.080]   Like God is available to everyone who calls on him.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.480]   To anyone that prays to him.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.560]   To all who call on him in truth.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.720]   God is near to you.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.800]   When we call out to God,
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.440]   God comes near to us.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.080]   And when God comes near,
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.000]   everything comes into perspective.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.640]   It's like if you were to stand
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.280]   at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.360]   or you stand at the height of a skyscraper,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.840]   or you're adrift in the open ocean,
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.400]   and you pray to God that never happens to you,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.000]   everything comes into perspective in that moment, right?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.080]   You realize how small you are.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.240]   When God is near,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.280]   you realize how dominating,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.640]   and everlasting, and transcendent he is.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.640]   And you also realize how infinitely small
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.200]   and urgently expiring you are.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.800]   This is what happens when we come close to the Lord,
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.880]   when we get near to his presence.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.680]   The nearer we come to him,
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.760]   the clearer he becomes to us.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.400]   So then why do we feel so far from him at times?
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.000]   Like I'm not too naive to believe,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.320]   like some of you have walked in here tonight,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.640]   and you're like, man, God feels a million miles away.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.700]   He couldn't feel further off.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.720]   You're talking about him being near?
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.200]   That is not at all the case for my reality.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.800]   What are you even talking about?
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.520]   I've been there.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.800]   Let me tell you what I wish I could tell myself
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.120]   in past moments like that.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:15.080]   God hasn't moved.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:22.060]   God has only and always moved in one direction,
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.400]   and it's towards us.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.120]   God wants to be near to us.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.740]   That's what the Bible is trying to tell us.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.200]   That's what the culmination of the person of Jesus
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.540]   is making clear.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.480]   God wanted to be so close to us
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:42.060]   that he would send his only son to remove any obstacle,
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.080]   to remove any imposition.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.980]   God would do anything to get close to you.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.500]   So why does he feel so far off?
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.320]   Because we have impeded our prayers
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.620]   and obstructed our passage to his presence.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.240]   We've blockaded our nearness to him
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.920]   because we've become preoccupied with things
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.980]   that are not of him.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.960]   Because we become anxious.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.560]   Like that's where Paul goes next.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.600]   Like as he keeps going, he says,
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.640]   "Hey, the Lord is at hand, so do not be anxious.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.420]   "Don't become so absorbed by that future possibility
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:25.560]   "that you forget or you neglect God's present proximity,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.240]   "that he's here, he's nearby."
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   In the Greek, the word that Paul uses here for anxious
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.040]   is a really interesting word.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.680]   It's a word that means to divide or to tear apart.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.080]   It's literally the idea of two opposing forces
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.240]   pulling something apart.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.040]   Something that was whole is now being divided into two,
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.200]   which is a really good word picture
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.280]   because that's kind of what anxiety does to us, right?
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.640]   It leaves us torn up.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.400]   It's like, oh my gosh, I'm like split in half.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.720]   I don't feel whole at all.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.400]   I feel like I've given part of myself to this thing
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.560]   and part of myself to this thing
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.160]   and maybe another part of myself to that thing.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.520]   Like this is what anxiety does to us.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.760]   A.J. Cronin, he says,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   "Our anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.920]   "It only empties today of its strength."
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.800]   Your anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.680]   It only empties today of its strength.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.120]   When you're anxious,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.360]   it does nothing to help you in the future
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.120]   and it does everything to hurt you in the present.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.000]   This is what anxiety does.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.080]   Anxiety is like our rocking chair.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.080]   Like it takes an initial investment of effort
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.520]   and as you worry, it may feel nice,
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.280]   but it is terribly unproductive
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.360]   and it takes you nowhere that you're wishing to go.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.400]   This is what anxiety does to us.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.840]   And so what does Paul say?
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.560]   Like, what are we supposed to do with that?
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.120]   And he goes on.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.240]   "Don't be anxious about anything,
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.920]   "but in everything by prayer and supplication,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.400]   "talking to God with thanksgiving,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.800]   "let your requests be made known to him."
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.240]   Paul is echoing now the words of Jesus.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.000]   In Matthew 6, 31, 33, it says,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.760]   "Therefore, do not be anxious saying,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.480]   "what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.600]   "or what shall we wear,
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.000]   "but seek first the kingdom of God.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.560]   "Seek the things of God
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.200]   "and everything else will be added unto you."
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.840]   Everything you need,
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.680]   whatever's claiming for your attention,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.160]   it's taken care of whenever you're one of God's own kids.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.640]   Whenever you trust him and you seek his things,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.360]   what you learn is that I worry about nothing,
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.560]   but I pray about everything.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.760]   This is the way that we as the children of God
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.200]   are meant to engage the world,
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.080]   engage our adversity, engage our anxiety.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.920]   Like what we're supposed to do
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.040]   is we're supposed to worry about none of it,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.920]   but pray about all of it,
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.000]   because we have a God, a father in heaven
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.480]   that looks after us, that takes care of us,
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.600]   that knows what we need and meets our needs
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.000]   in ways that we know not to meet for ourselves.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.060]   So this is all really good in theory,
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.520]   but the truth of the matter is we're pretty bad at this.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.560]   I'm pretty bad at it.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.960]   I'll throw myself into the lot.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   Like we know that we should go to God,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.560]   give things to him and trust the fact
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.920]   that he's gonna take care of us.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.160]   And yet instead what we do,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.840]   instead of giving ourselves to him,
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.400]   we often give ourselves to other things.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.720]   We lend ourselves to anxieties over our performance
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.480]   or our singleness or our addiction or our reputation
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.640]   or something that happened in our past,
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.000]   some trauma that we've incurred.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.440]   And what happens whenever we feel anxiety
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.880]   about these things, about my performance at work,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.360]   like my desire to do a good job,
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.760]   like I could give this to God,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.760]   but instead what so often we do is we just suppress it.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.880]   We push it down.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.440]   We bury it down deep.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.920]   We try not to let anybody know
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.880]   that things are not actually okay.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.720]   Hey, how's work going?
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.520]   Work is great.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.640]   It is so good.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.920]   I love my cubicle, my team.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.640]   They're critical sometimes, but you know what?
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.960]   Like I think that they're just trying
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.320]   to help me be the best version of me I can be.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.760]   And so we just push it aside.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.320]   We suppress it as much as possible
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.640]   in the hopes that in doing so, it will go away.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.920]   When you do that, when you suppress your anxiety,
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.880]   it doesn't go away.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.480]   It just changes shape.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.600]   Now it becomes something different to manage.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.640]   Or maybe it's not suppression.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.600]   Maybe that's not how you deal with your anxiety.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   Maybe instead it's something like obsession.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.360]   With my dating life, with my singleness,
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:00.800]   with the fact that I don't wanna be alone forever,
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.040]   with the fact that my relationship
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.280]   isn't in fact where I want it to be.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.120]   And so you know what I'll do?
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.720]   Like I'm gonna help it along.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.800]   Like I'm anxious about this.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.760]   And so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna take,
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.800]   I'm gonna take some of myself
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.920]   and I'm actually now going to focus on my appearance.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.080]   I'm gonna give myself over to the gym
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.480]   or to that Pilates class or to CrossFit
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.320]   or whatever it may be
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.680]   that's gonna make me more desirable physically.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.680]   But I'm not just gonna do that.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.040]   I'm also going to give another piece of myself
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.480]   a way to being socially acceptable.
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.040]   So now I'm gonna reject some of these friends
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.000]   and engage with more of these friends
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.480]   because this is what it looks like
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.920]   for me to be more desirable to my boyfriend, my girlfriend,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.720]   or that guy or girl that I like
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.920]   that hasn't yet asked me out
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.760]   and yet I'm going to continue to do it.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.520]   And then maybe it's not just that.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.240]   Maybe I'm gonna change my behavior.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.400]   I'm gonna make now some compromises in life.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.040]   I'm gonna bend my physical boundaries.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.320]   I'm gonna be willing to go places
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.160]   I know I shouldn't do things
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.880]   I know I shouldn't spend time,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.200]   more time than necessary
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.360]   in things that I wish I could take back.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.880]   Like we give ourselves away
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   and what happens is we don't,
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.480]   we don't get rid of our anxiety.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.880]   What we do is we just multiply it.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.920]   Now instead of one thing,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.680]   you have multiple things you have to worry about.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.840]   Just as anxiety is described in the Greek,
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.840]   it's torn you, not just in two, not just in three,
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.800]   but maybe into four or five, six, multiple pieces.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.360]   This is what we do.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.040]   We suppress, we obsess over our anxiety
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.880]   in the hopes that this is how I'm gonna fix it.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.680]   This is how it's gonna get resolved.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.600]   You know what Paul's telling us to do?
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.720]   Do not suppress, do not obsess, just confess it.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.360]   Just confess it.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.600]   Just come to God.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.880]   Like just come talk to him.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.560]   His door's open, he's available, he's close by,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.520]   just pray to him.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.000]   Just engage with the God of the universe.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.480]   Like I love that he says here,
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   "Let your requests be made known."
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   Like that verb is a passive verb,
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.200]   which just means it's not something you're actively doing.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.920]   You're not actively requesting of God,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.600]   you're instinctively requesting of God,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.360]   which is what we all do whenever times get hard.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.440]   We wanna talk to people about it.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.360]   Work is tough, I wanna engage with someone about that idea.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.320]   I wanna process it, I need a sounding board.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.760]   I need someone to help me process through my venting, right?
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.600]   Or in a relationship, like I need my girls
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.000]   and my guys to help me out, to process through these things.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.640]   We want to talk about them.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.920]   That is instinctual.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.960]   You're meant to let it out.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.280]   But here's what Paul's saying.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   You don't just let it out, you lift it up.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.920]   You lift it up to God.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.000]   You do, you absolutely go and talk to someone about it.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.800]   You talk to him, that's who you talk to.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.240]   He wants to hear from you
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.760]   because he is the only one who can truly help you.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.440]   Charles Spurgeon says, "The best style of prayer
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.040]   is that which cannot be called anything else but a cry."
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.800]   The best style of prayer,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.200]   it can't be called anything but a cry.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.960]   It is instinctual to pray.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.840]   Like we said at the beginning,
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.800]   it's hardwired into our human nature.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.280]   And what's fascinating is I was thinking
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.920]   about this idea, if you think about prayer,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.000]   the concept of it may have been taught to you
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.400]   by someone else, maybe someone like me,
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.080]   teaching you about this concept of prayer.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.520]   But the practice of prayer was likely not taught
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.040]   to you by anybody.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.120]   Like more than likely, times got tough, things got hard.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.960]   And what you did is you just reflexively started talking
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.800]   to God about it.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.680]   You kicked God, help, please.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.360]   Like what's happening in my work?
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.040]   What's happening with my family?
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.560]   God, I didn't even say that,
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   but look at what's happening to my reputation.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.600]   Lord, please, would you help me in this area?
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.120]   It's hardwired into you.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.320]   God has put it into you
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.240]   because he wants you to engage with him.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.600]   Do you see the love of God in that?
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.000]   That he said, "Hey, I designed you for me.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.960]   I didn't design you for all these other things.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.560]   You're not supposed to get sidetracked
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.240]   and swept off your feet with a myriad of other anxieties,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.200]   concerns, or worries in life.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.760]   No, you're supposed to be fixed upon me."
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.720]   All these things that are demanding your attention.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.640]   I'm the only one deserving it.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.280]   I'm the only one that deserves your attention.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.320]   I'm the only one that can help you in it.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.720]   And I want to, that's the heart of God.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.440]   Like I know for myself, just to get really practical,
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.480]   like Kylan, how do you even do this?
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.320]   When I wake up in the morning,
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.280]   I sit down and the first thing I do
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.680]   is I take an inventory of how I feel.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.220]   Where are my emotions at?
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.560]   That's what I wanna know.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.160]   Like, did I get up off the wrong side of the bed?
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.480]   Am I nervous about what's coming today?
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.680]   Am I in a fight?
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.320]   Is there conflict in my home between my wife and I?
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.560]   Like, how do I feel right now?
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.000]   And what I do as I assess my emotions
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.880]   is I reverse engineer back from them.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.000]   And I try to figure out why I feel that way.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.740]   And so often what I find is they're rooted in anxiety.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.760]   I'm nervous, I'm anxious, I'm stressed about something
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.720]   that is coming for me later in the day.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.260]   And so what I do in those moments is two things.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.520]   I admit them to God and I submit them to God.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.720]   I admit them and I submit them.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.840]   God, I admit this is where I'm at, Lord.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.960]   I wish this weren't the case, but God, this is the truth.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.680]   And then God, I submit it to you.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.020]   I wish I didn't, God.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.380]   And yet, Lord, I know, even at my worst, Christ died for me.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.780]   And so I'm loved and accepted
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.480]   and you're capable of changing me.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.680]   This is the way that I approach it.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.000]   What I don't do is I don't spiritualize my complaining.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.160]   Like, I don't come to the Lord and say,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.720]   "God, I wish you would help me at work
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.460]   "because my boss hates me and my coworkers are so critical.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.440]   "And God, I never thought I'd still be stuck in this job
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.880]   "and I'm never gonna amount to anything.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.280]   "Oh my gosh, I'm never gonna make a difference."
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.800]   Like, I don't just start complaining to God.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.640]   That's not what I do.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.480]   That's indulging my anxiety.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.880]   That's permitting it.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.920]   And we don't permit it.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.520]   We admit it, we submit it, and then we move on.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.880]   And we trust it with him.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.340]   We come to the Lord and we say,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.520]   "God, here's what has my heart."
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.240]   We spread it on the table.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.000]   We trust him with it.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.160]   And then we go forward and believe
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.360]   that he will work it for our good
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.520]   because that's what he's done all along.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.400]   And as we do these things,
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.000]   what we find is what happens in verse seven,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.160]   "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.120]   "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.520]   It's interesting.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.000]   This expression, peace of God,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.400]   only appears one time in the entire New Testament,
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.920]   which is right here, which feels weird, right?
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.600]   Peace in God.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   They kind of go together.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.480]   Wouldn't you expect that to see,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.120]   you would expect to see that somewhere else.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.480]   It's a match made in heaven.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.760]   And yet what you need to know
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.500]   is that Paul is saying something very specific
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.600]   about God's peace in this moment.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.560]   You see, what Paul is saying about God's peace
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.040]   is he's saying this isn't a transactional peace.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.680]   Like this isn't just a quid pro quo relationship
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.480]   where God, I give you my anxiety
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   and you give me your peace.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.440]   That's not how this works.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.480]   It's not a transactional peace.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.920]   And it's not even a constitutional peace
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.360]   that I have peace with God
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.080]   through my justification in Jesus Christ,
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.920]   though that's true.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.640]   But that's not what he's talking about right here.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.760]   What he's talking about
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.680]   is he's talking about an existential peace,
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.360]   an existential peace.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   So what does that mean?
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.040]   I'll illustrate it to you like this.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.200]   When my wife and I went on a honeymoon,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.060]   we went to an all-inclusive resort.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.240]   This is an aside, not a part of the lesson,
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.960]   but I recommend an all-inclusive, man.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.880]   Like you just spent the last several months
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.160]   planning the biggest party of your life.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.580]   It's nice to go make some indulgent decisions
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.880]   with no cost to you whatsoever,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.280]   an impulsive decision, right?
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.200]   Not indulgent, impulsive.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.640]   Go make an impulsive decision.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.860]   Go to an all-inclusive resort.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.240]   And yet what we did when we were there
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.800]   is we spent money on one thing.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.920]   And the one thing we spent money on
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.160]   is we went to the resort spa.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.320]   I had never been to a spa before.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.400]   And I don't know that I've been since.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.440]   But that experience was unlike anything
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.240]   I had ever had before.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.860]   It was otherworldly.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.860]   Like we walked into the spa and everything changed.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:48.320]   Like the music in the air wasn't like
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.000]   whatever party music was playing outside.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.800]   Instead it was this, it was the sound of raindrops
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.120]   and birds chirping, which doesn't sound that enticing.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.040]   And yet it was incredible.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.720]   And like the look of the room,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.600]   the room was like just enveloped in this soft white glow.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.920]   And the smell in the air was fresh.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.440]   It's like citrus, mint.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.560]   And then the lady at the front desk,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.040]   she even spoke in an otherworldly way.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.240]   "Hello, welcome to the spa.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.640]   It is our joy to serve you today.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.280]   Would you like one of our complimentary robes?
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.120]   Sure."
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.440]   Two men appear in a robe that's in warm blankets.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.280]   You know?
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.320]   It was like, it was unlike anything I had ever experienced.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.960]   That's what happens when you come to the presence of God.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.880]   That's what this is saying,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.480]   that when you give your anxiety over to him,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.720]   you step into his, you step into his peace.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.640]   Like you come into his presence,
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.840]   an environment that befits him.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   God, by his very nature, is not morally errored in any way.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.400]   Like from God comes no disorder,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.440]   no disruption, no deterioration.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:15.140]   He is peace-giving, perfect, whole,
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.240]   which is in fact what this word means.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.040]   Like the word here for peace,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.160]   it doesn't just mean tranquility or calm,
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.120]   it means wholeness.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.400]   That when you come to God and you find
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:32.160]   that he is as unified and complete
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.960]   and not disordered, but ordered and perfect
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.680]   as you have been told,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   he takes all of these broken and separated
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.360]   and torn asunder pieces of you,
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   and he begins to make them whole together again.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.820]   He unites the parts of yourself.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.380]   That you've given away.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.900]   He takes that obsession you have with your performance,
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.760]   that suppression you've applied to your addiction,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.180]   that focus you have on your reputation,
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:10.620]   and he blends them back together.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.820]   And he makes you as he himself is,
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.660]   whole, not divided,
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.180]   but united.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.100]   This is what this verse means.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.100]   The result of prayer is that it doesn't change God.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.980]   Prayer changes you.
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.060]   That's why we pray.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.920]   That's why we come to the Lord.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.220]   Like what we find is that God is available
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.660]   and capable for us.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.700]   He's available.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.660]   He loves you.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.740]   He's been waiting for you to come,
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.980]   and he's capable, he's strong enough for you.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.860]   He can fix whatever it is you need help with.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.940]   This is his heart.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.120]   Does that mean that as you pray,
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.300]   you're gonna get everything you want from him?
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.060]   That he's gonna answer your prayers the minute you ask?
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.620]   Maybe, maybe, maybe not, right?
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.780]   Like he may answer that prayer.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.060]   He may not answer that prayer.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.260]   He won't answer all of them.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.340]   But what you can take confidence in
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.500]   is in Matthew chapter six,
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.220]   Jesus looks at his disciples and he says,
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.980]   "Your father in heaven knows what you need
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.220]   "before you ask it."
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.100]   Why am I even praying then?
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.700]   If he already knows,
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.900]   like why do I need to talk to him about it?
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:32.140]   For this reason,
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:38.300]   prayer isn't about convincing God of your needs.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.100]   Prayer is about convincing you of your need for him.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.380]   That's why you come to him.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.620]   That's why you pray to him.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.140]   Because you and I need to be reminded
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.940]   that it's him we need and nothing else.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.580]   This is what we need to know.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.220]   And this is why he has called us to himself
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.060]   to meet with him in a place that promises
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.280]   to guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus, Lord.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   So last story.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:13.180]   Horatio Spafford was a successful lawyer and businessman
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.460]   that lived in Chicago in the 1800s.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.460]   He was part of a family of six.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.500]   He has a father to a wife named Anna
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.200]   and they had four beautiful girls.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.140]   150 years ago today,
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.020]   on November 21st of 1873,
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.180]   he sent his family across the Atlantic to England
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.680]   to go on vacation for the holiday.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.700]   But 150 years ago today, November 21st,
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.820]   the French vessel which his family,
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.940]   his wife and four daughters were aboard,
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.980]   it collided into another seafaring vessel.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:54.340]   And in the middle of the Atlantic, their ship sank.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:02.700]   The only person to survive the collision was his wife.
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:09.620]   She wired him and she said these six words,
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.260]   she said, "Saved alone, what shall I do?"
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.860]   To which, as the record books recall,
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.980]   he quickly booked passage to meet her where she was
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:28.860]   and process through their grief and make their way forward.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.180]   As he's set sail to find her,
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.800]   to be reunited, some four days from landfall,
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.560]   the captain of his ship, aware of the crisis
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.900]   that has befallen Horatio's family,
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.220]   calls Horatio to his captain's quarters
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.340]   because he knows that the place upon which their vessel
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.220]   is now traversing is approximately the place
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.920]   where his family's vessel sank.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.360]   And he wanted to tell him himself.
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.460]   So he tells Horatio the news,
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.220]   that this is where it happened.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:11.220]   This is where your family was taken from you.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.000]   (gentle music)
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.580]   What's amazing is what happens next.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.580]   Alerted of the news, Horatio,
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.960]   he steps outside the captain's quarters
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.980]   and he finds some space there on the boat.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:31.500]   And in response to tragedy, worry, concern, adversity,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:38.100]   anxiety, he penned these famous words.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:44.020]   When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.780]   when sorrows like sea billows roll,
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:53.340]   whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.860]   it is well with my soul.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:02.420]   In the depth of Horatio's horror,
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.260]   the hardship of his circumstance, the depths of his grief,
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.980]   and in the midst of your own,
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:15.980]   there is a superior, transcendent, yet eminent peace
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:24.740]   which you can find from a God that is equally superior,
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.140]   transcendent, and eminent to you.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:35.700]   Horatio knew there is one place which peace is freely given
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:41.500]   and it's in the God that freely gave his only Son for me.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:48.580]   Friends, I don't know what you walked in here tonight
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:53.300]   dealing with, but I do know this,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.460]   there is peace for you in the person of Jesus.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.460]   There's peace nowhere else in this world.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.580]   You won't find it elsewhere.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:06.540]   You need only come to him to receive it.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:10.820]   The presence of God, the fullness of his wonder,
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.980]   which many of you have been longing to experience,
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.180]   it's available to you tonight
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:24.180]   because the presence of God became the person of God
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.460]   in the form of his Son.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:32.580]   You see, when we knew not to pray and seek God's presence,
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.380]   the very presence of God,
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.860]   the image of his glory, as Hebrews would say,
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.260]   sought us out in the person of the Son.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.100]   When we knew not to lift our worries to him,
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:52.100]   Jesus nevertheless brought God's peace down to us.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.700]   And when we knew not of our need for change,
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:01.780]   evil at heart darkened the understanding of our minds.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.860]   God never lost sight of the fact
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.540]   that something needed to change in us,
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.540]   that we might be reunited to him.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.020]   He gave it all that you might come close to him.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.180]   The question for you tonight, Porch,
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.580]   is how much of him do you want?
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.100]   How much of him do you want?
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.100]   Let me pray for us.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.680]   (gentle music)
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:44.300]   The Lord is near.
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:50.140]   In the quietness of where you sit with your eyes closed,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.660]   can you just take a moment
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.260]   and just say, "Lord, I need you."
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.840]   (gentle music)
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.340]   And can you register with that reality?
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.620]   That God, he's not distant, he's not dormant,
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.220]   he's not some idea or concept to study.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.500]   He's living, he's breathing, and he's here tonight.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.820]   He's near to you now.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.100]   Come awake to it.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.120]   (gentle music)
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.960]   He's willing to be near to us, God.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.320]   When we were unworthy, undeserving God,
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.080]   chasing after all manner of evil instead of you,
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.640]   you never lost sight of what we needed.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.660]   You swept in God, the hero of heaven,
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.420]   racing through the halls of history
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.920]   to be reunited to a people that knew not to want you.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.000]   And you came in the most unsuspecting of ways to Jesus,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.840]   coming in a form that we would not look to admire or respect,
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.920]   but looking like ourselves,
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:07.200]   a king deserving of worship, become a servant
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.480]   to even the worst sinners of men.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.280]   It's been in your heart, God, to be near to us.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.280]   You, God, have pursued us, and you have finished it.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.640]   You've made passage possible again when there was no way.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.520]   You, God, made a way by the death of your only son,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.480]   bearing in him all the consequence of our sin, God,
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:43.680]   that every one of us might be justified before you,
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.200]   cleansed of our wrong, washed clean of our iniquity,
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.400]   but God, not only did our sin bury him
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.660]   and did he absorb the punishment due us,
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.440]   but he rose forth from the grave,
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.560]   bursting God from death, declaring to the world,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.240]   I am who I say I am.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:07.880]   I am the son of God.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:13.480]   I am a son from on high come to seek sinners down low
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.720]   that those down low might believe in me
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.800]   and come back high where I have returned.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:29.440]   Brother, sister, do you want to experience the wonder of God?
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:34.520]   That wonder is found in one man and one alone,
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.020]   and it is Jesus's name.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.760]   Come to him tonight.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.880]   Place your faith in him.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.880]   For those of you that have already done it,
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.520]   now is a moment for you to do whatever it means
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.060]   to engage with he that is near.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.540]   Maybe you need to sing.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.120]   Maybe you need to raise your hands and lift your voices
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.520]   and declare to God how wonderful he is.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.140]   But maybe you need to pray.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:03.860]   Maybe you need to sit close by he that has come close by.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.780]   And you just need to know.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.840]   He doesn't need anything from you.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.960]   He wants everything for you.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:23.480]   And everything finds its fulfillment in him.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.040]   We love you, God.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.680]   We sing to you now.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.320]   We're grateful.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.480]   It's in Jesus's name we pray.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.400]   Amen.
