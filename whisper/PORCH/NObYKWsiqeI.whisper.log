[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.600]   - Alright, well hey, welcome friends in the room
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.900]   in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Fayetteville, Phoenix,
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.340]   Boise, Idaho, all the other PortsLive locations,
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.540]   and especially all of us in the room.
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.860]   We are continuing the series, Roaring 20s,
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.260]   how to have 20s, the decade between 2020 and 2030
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.120]   that roar in every way you want them to
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.320]   and every way that God wants them to,
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.260]   not to just survive the next decade or your 20s,
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.980]   but to thrive in a way that leads to the type of life
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.700]   that God wants and ultimately you want.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.580]   Tonight, I'm gonna start by just telling kind of a story
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.200]   that'll give some direction for where we're going.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.420]   In college, I had a chance to be on the track team
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.140]   where I went to school, and my first year of college
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.740]   showed up, and track is a spring sport,
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.620]   so the fall was a time of like conditioning and training
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.820]   and just doing a bunch of exercises,
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.420]   getting ready for the season coming up.
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.280]   I threw the javelin, which is the most random sport
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.940]   on the planet, which explains how I was able to do it
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.740]   at that school, 'cause there's like three of us
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.680]   out there that do it, but anyways,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.220]   so I was with all the throwers, so you got javelin,
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.020]   shop hood, just people who were part of the throws group.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.140]   And the biggest challenge in the conditioning season
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.740]   or that semester, the fall semester, that we had,
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.180]   it was a bunch of tests that you'd have to do
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.860]   and a bunch of weightlifting things, hear me roar,
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.780]   but there was also this thing called the obstacle course.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.660]   The obstacle course was this test that our coach,
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.620]   named Chico, who was like a mad scientist,
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.460]   had put together, and it was something
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.620]   that was the most dreaded of all the different tests
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.420]   that we had to do, and it was at the end of the semester,
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.340]   so you spent the entire semester training,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.980]   and then you had to end it by doing this obstacle course
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.580]   that he'd put together.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.200]   Here's what it was, briefly.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.300]   It was basically, you would take these weights
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.980]   or these shop hoods that weighed like 16 pounds,
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.900]   you'd have to run and snake the bleachers,
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.340]   which means run up and run down,
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.780]   and basically run up all the way on the stadium,
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.120]   set the weight at the top, come back down,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.700]   run the bleachers again, pick up another weight,
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.820]   run around the track, jumping over hurdles,
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.200]   and then snake the bleachers again, set it down,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.580]   all for time.
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.060]   So I didn't know exactly what to expect
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.460]   and how hard this would be, and I show up on the day
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.380]   that the obstacle course is there, and everybody,
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.600]   it's like their least favorite day.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.340]   You can just tell, everyone is like getting ready for it,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.500]   and as a freshman, you really don't know
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.560]   exactly what to expect.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.780]   I've never done this before, so you have this mixture
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.660]   of like all this insecurity of am I about to die,
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.220]   and all of this pride of like these pansies,
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.400]   I'm about to take this thing down and set a new record,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.780]   and the coach looks at me and says,
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.660]   hey, you're the youngest, you'll go first, set the pace.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.060]   So again, step into the line, getting ready for this,
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.100]   about to show Usain Bolt here, and I take off,
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.580]   and I pick up the weight, and I run,
[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.620]   and I snake the bleachers, and things are going okay,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.060]   and I'm going up and down, and I'm going up and down,
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.960]   and I get to the top, I'm finishing lap one,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.160]   I set the weight down there, continue running,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.760]   go and pick up the second weight, I'm about to start lap two,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.980]   start to run around the track, jumping over the hurdles,
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.740]   get back to the bleachers, snake 'em again,
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.420]   and it was like everything in my body that was going,
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.740]   man, I'm a phenom, I mean, literally, the coach,
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.100]   at some point, I look over, and he's showing another coach
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.260]   my time of lap one, and I'm like, dude,
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.180]   they're about to move me to the sprinters team,
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.340]   that's what's about to happen.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.340]   And I get to that first bleacher step,
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.800]   and my body is like, shut her down!
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.380]   And lactic acid fills my legs,
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.460]   like, I didn't even know this much lactic acid existed
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.740]   in your legs, and everything that was going
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.060]   from like a sprint literally shuts
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.660]   and comes to a complete halt, and it becomes like a walk
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.940]   for the rest of the time, trying to do these bleachers.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.980]   I mean, it was like to the point of embarrassment
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.260]   where like the entire track, all of a sudden,
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.900]   it's like, you know, they're out there in the field,
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.500]   and everyone's attention goes from like,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.100]   whatever they're doing to, look at, like out of pity,
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.700]   you know those moments where they're like,
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.420]   someone please make it stop, I just feel terrible for him,
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.420]   look at him, he's so unathletic, and I just,
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.800]   for like such a snail's pace, I didn't even know
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.500]   if I was going to be able to finish it,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.980]   and kept moving, and finally just kind of got
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.840]   to the very end, and totally collapsed,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.420]   and my coach comes over, and he says,
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.980]   "David, that was the fastest first lap I've ever seen."
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.200]   And that was the slowest second lap I have ever seen.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.700]   It wasn't, I lost to everybody, and it wasn't even close,
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.900]   it was like, you know, six minutes, six minutes,
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.320]   six minutes, 49 minutes.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.540]   I mean, it was like guys that weighed 300 pounds
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.100]   over shop putters were like jogging past me,
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.340]   and it was just one of those occasions
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.900]   where what had started so well, and had so much momentum,
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.940]   all of a sudden came to such a halt,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.400]   and my ability to even keep running was no longer possible.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.600]   What does that have to do with what we're talking
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.180]   about tonight?
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.580]   Well, tonight we're going to examine one of the truths
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.500]   and principles from God's word that really we're doing
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.680]   throughout this series that we're covering.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.920]   In this young adult age, there are certain issues
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.400]   that are really at the forefront of things
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.420]   that if you're going to thrive, or have 20s that roar,
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.340]   you need to know how to handle these different issues.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.400]   And handle them not just according to your friend's opinion
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.000]   or the latest blog, but according to God's word.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.540]   Things like dating, finances, career,
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.540]   like what does it look like to approach these topics well?
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.120]   And tonight's topic isn't any of those,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.200]   but I think is as important as any other topic
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.720]   that we're going to have in this series.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   Because if you don't get this topic right,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.500]   it will hinder your ability to keep running.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.720]   It's the reason why so many Christians go out with a bang,
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.240]   or they have this season in their life where they're like,
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.320]   I'm on fire for Jesus, I'll never walk away,
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.220]   and just I'm all in, I'm going to become a missionary.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.480]   And then something happens, and slowly they just begin
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.760]   to drift away from their faith, and they don't even know
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.200]   if they believe in God anymore.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.800]   It's responsible for why so many people
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.640]   who claim to be Christians, and they pledge their life
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.120]   to another person who claims to be a Christian,
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.120]   and they stand on an altar and say,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.740]   'til death do us part, and then a number of years later,
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.280]   sign papers that say, I don't want anything to do with you,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.680]   I want a divorce.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.440]   Because they didn't apply this principle,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.560]   this biblical truth.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.040]   It's a reason why so many of you, candidly,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   feel so alone right now.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.620]   And there's an anxiety that kind of washes over you,
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.080]   and you wonder if anyone out there cares.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.320]   It's a reason why so many people who claim to be Christians
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.980]   don't actually look any different than the world around us,
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.360]   and give a bad name to Christ.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.040]   And it's this principle, or this idea,
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.920]   related to this topic, your friendships.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.360]   Tonight, what I wanna talk about
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.820]   is having the right friendships.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.820]   The Bible, over and over, says that if you get this wrong,
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.280]   you can know the path that you are headed on
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.520]   is not gonna be a path that you're gonna like.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.160]   It's been well said that, man, you show me your friends,
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.200]   and I'll show you your future,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.660]   and the Bible says that over and over and over.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.460]   So what I wanna talk about is, in this stage,
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.760]   making sure you have the right friendships
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.900]   and relationships around you,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.060]   that your squad is filled with the people
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.740]   that the God who's there wants to be a part of that.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.500]   So I wanna define what type
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.180]   of right relationships you should have.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.820]   And if you're taking notes, you can write this down,
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.420]   right friendships, biblically, like these are the people,
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.920]   no matter who's been my crew,
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.620]   the world says ride or die.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.780]   It is not ride or die with the wrong people.
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.400]   The friendships that I should have
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.640]   should be relationships that I live authentically
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.140]   in relationship with people committed to Christ.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.980]   The type of friendships that should mark your life
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.940]   is living authentically in relationships,
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.420]   like ongoing, with people who are committed to Christ.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.540]   This is the thing that if you're back in church,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.300]   and we get this story all the time,
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.540]   and you're like, man, this is my year,
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.140]   I'm going all in, I really wanna get serious.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.100]   I can tell you right now whether or not 2020
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.100]   is gonna be a year where you grow closer to God or not,
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.060]   if you tell me who you're running with.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.580]   And so if you are a follower of Jesus,
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.740]   and you want to really see and experience
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.600]   the transformation, the type of life,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.040]   you wanna head towards the right marriage someday,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.820]   you wanna make sure that you're not being a fool
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.360]   as it relates to your money, your career,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.720]   all those different things,
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.000]   at the epicenter of that,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.260]   directly related to your ability
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.260]   to wisely navigate those arenas
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.200]   is gonna be the friendships that you have around.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.000]   So let me unpack this sentence.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.720]   Every single word in that sentence was intentionally chosen
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.120]   that you would live authentically in relationship
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.520]   with people committed to Christ.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.200]   Live authentically in relationship
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.060]   with people committed to Christ.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.900]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.520]   So first thing, live authentically.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.580]   This is probably the hardest one,
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.320]   because 90% of you in the room are gonna be like,
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.020]   dude, check the box, I feel like I'm done,
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.080]   I'm gonna go see the food trucks.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.040]   I live authentically, and you don't.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.720]   You manage information, you don't tell the whole truth,
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.600]   you don't actually live in a way
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.440]   that has other believers in your life
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.560]   who know where you're hurting, you're struggling,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.440]   where you're having a hard time,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.360]   where your mind is just like tripping on toxic thought
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.160]   after toxic thought, who know your internet history,
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.920]   who know the relationship that you're in,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.160]   they know the ins and the outs
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   and all the different ways that you are living
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.200]   or not living according to God.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.040]   And I know some of you are like,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.400]   no, I really think that I am.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.200]   The vast majority of you,
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.800]   this is not something that you are experiencing,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.240]   and I'll unpack why I say that here in a second.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.280]   And then the others of us,
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.560]   that maybe you're in a place where you're like,
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.320]   no, I really am living authentically
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.360]   with the community group and with my friendships,
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.680]   people who love God.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.800]   This is a tension that it never goes away.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.880]   It's something to constantly pursue, living authentically.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.720]   What do I mean by that?
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.320]   The Bible says that you and I,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.720]   in Hebrews chapter three, verse 12 and 13,
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.240]   are to see to it, brothers,
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.360]   that none of you has a sinful and unbelieving heart
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.160]   that turns away from the living God,
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.120]   but encourage, or in other words,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.480]   here's the remedy to make sure,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.320]   none of you allow sin to get buried in your heart
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.640]   and it begins to grow and grow and harden your heart
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   and turn you away from God.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.080]   And the way that you prevent that heart hardening
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.480]   is by doing this,
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   but encourage or exhort or call out one another daily,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.720]   as long as it's called today.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.840]   This is like him saying, every day that ends in Y,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.760]   so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness,
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.360]   that you're to have relationships
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.000]   with other people in your life,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   that you are open in such a way
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.640]   where they can speak into your life
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.000]   and you can speak into theirs,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.320]   the places where they need to be called out
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.300]   and where you need to be called out.
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.000]   James chapter five, verse 16 says,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   confess your sins to each other
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.220]   and pray for each other so that you would be healed.
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.360]   Do you have people in your life
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.000]   that you can actually be honest and confess sins to?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   And that they don't respond by making fun of you
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.160]   or just being like, dude, it's cool,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.120]   you know, everybody does it,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   but they sit there, they pray for you,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.040]   they come alongside and encourage and hold you accountable
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.160]   where you can be authentic, known.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.400]   Ephesians chapter four, verse 25 says,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.440]   stop telling lies.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.320]   Praise him.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.600]   Let us tell our neighbors or one another the truth
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.240]   for we are all part of the same body.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.220]   This means not managing information,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.640]   it means you being honest
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.120]   and telling people the whole truth,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.920]   being specific about where you're having a tough time
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.380]   and living in the light,
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.120]   not with every single person everywhere
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.580]   and posting it all on Facebook,
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.080]   but with authentic relationships in your life
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.360]   where you can be real with other people.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.780]   The Bible says this is to mark you and I's life.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.860]   It's funny living in 2020,
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.700]   one of my favorite things about living today
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.220]   is social media, like this explosion of social media
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.100]   that the vast majority of human history
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.860]   has not had anything like,
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.060]   but today, I mean, just with Facebook
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.860]   and with Instagram and with Twitter,
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.040]   like it allows you to keep up with high school friends,
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.940]   you would have no idea what they're up to,
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.380]   but I like know high school friends,
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.440]   you know, their kids' names
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.160]   or people just kind of in my tribe
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.580]   that previously had there been no Facebook, no Instagram,
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.660]   I would have no idea what's going on
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.660]   or that you have a dog or that you live in Phoenix
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.980]   or any of the different ways that you're able to connect.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.900]   And not only that, you're able to like, you know,
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.820]   know about one another's life
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.940]   in ways that are both, you know,
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.460]   awesome and fun to connect with or know what's going on
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.700]   and kind of hilarious.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.080]   Like there's never been a time in human history
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.820]   where you would feel like I need to share
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.580]   with every friend I have ever and all of my family
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.340]   and even some strangers that this avocado toast,
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.540]   avocado toast I had is just so delicious,
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.460]   got to try this recipe, link in the bio.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.260]   There'd never be a time where I would say that,
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.620]   you know, there'd never be a time where I'm like,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.420]   I need to tell every person out there everywhere
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.220]   about my workout that I just had
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.460]   and so I'm going to call up all my friends.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.400]   Guys, it was brutal, this WOD, you wouldn't believe it.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.380]   I mean, it was just, it would never happen.
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.580]   But now with social media, we all feel compelled to like,
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.980]   hey, I'm going to get this out there and click
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.740]   and hey guys, this is what I did today.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.580]   Here's what's going on in my life.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.580]   But look at this sunset, look how beautiful it is.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.700]   And I need to tell everyone everywhere about this sunset.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.360]   It's just a funny time.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.660]   But it also is a great time because it leaves us connected.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.080]   But I think one of the dangers of social media
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   is that it teaches us to be amazing managers
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.740]   of people's perception of us.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.500]   It's just kind of part of the game.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.580]   Like everyone's social media, and I know we all know this,
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.260]   like everyone, you look at Instagram, you're Facebook,
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260]   you're like, yeah, that is not actually their real life
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.780]   and we're all doing it and you can even make money off
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.600]   of doing it by being called an influencer
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.300]   where you are shaping the perception
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.060]   that people have of you.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.000]   And we, without even knowing it,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.820]   are becoming better and better managers
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.500]   of people's perception of us.
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.320]   What do I mean?
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.100]   Like not long ago, my wife and I, it was Mother's Day,
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.260]   and we went and we celebrated, we had Mother's Day brunch.
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:40.860]   Here's a picture from mine.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.500]   So we had Mother's Day brunch, there's two little kids,
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.660]   and you know, this is great.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.440]   And underneath is like a caption of, hey, Callie,
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.820]   you are like the goat of moms, you're the best,
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.420]   something sweet, really romantic.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.820]   Just, you know, you know what I'm saying?
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.460]   And I don't know why I winked.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.780]   I was like, she's here, like, hey, baby, you know what I'm
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.620]   saying?
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.280]   But here's what you don't know in that picture.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.860]   It's like on the way to this breakfast that we're going
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.020]   to have brunch for Mother's Day, we're in conflict
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.460]   because I didn't get her a card for Mother's Day,
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.780]   and I know, just stop judging me right now.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.380]   And I got her other gifts and I had our kids sign the card,
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.980]   just different conflicts, so we're in conflict there.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.940]   And then at the brunch, we're there with family,
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.000]   our kids are going crazy, the daughter is sick,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.300]   she won't sit still, the entire thing was miserable.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.820]   It was like, this is the worst, the Mother's Day brunch
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.740]   is disgusting, and this is the worst Mother's Day brunch
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.580]   of all time.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.180]   But then if you were to just look on my world,
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.660]   you'd be like, oh my gosh, I'm so envious about what they
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.500]   have right now.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.580]   Or I don't know what emotion you would have,
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.180]   but you would go, oh, that looked like it must have been
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.020]   such a great brunch.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.700]   It was a terrible brunch, terrible morning,
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.940]   I'm still recovering, to be honest.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.780]   And,
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.140]   that's not true.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.380]   But we're excellent, and I'm not trying to mismanage
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.460]   or trying to throw it out there.
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.880]   Nobody wants to go to the Instagram page and it's like,
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.760]   this actually is a deceitful picture and not actually
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.040]   accurately capturing what's going on.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.680]   But my point is, without even realizing it,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.120]   we are experts at managing what people think
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.800]   and trying to manage the perception that they have of us,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.920]   what they think about us.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.120]   And where this becomes really dangerous is it begins
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.680]   to bleed in, I think, for lots of us, into our real life.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.840]   Where we're so good at it, we've taught ourselves
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.160]   to be so good at it, that when it comes to actual
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.980]   human relationships, like not Instagram relationships,
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.660]   like real friends, we're constantly in the mode
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.300]   of manage information, manage people's perception.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.860]   Don't actually be honest, try to say what you think
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.220]   they want you to say, try to be the person that you think
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.060]   that they want to see, and we're constantly keeping
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.020]   these superficial relationships.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.900]   And the tragedy is, all of us share the deep desire
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.380]   to be known, to be accepted, and to be loved.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.320]   And as long as I decide I'm gonna manage what you think
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.680]   about me, I'm not actually gonna tell you
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.340]   what I'm having a tough time, I'm not actually gonna
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.080]   open up my life, you can't actually love me,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.180]   because you don't actually know me.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.820]   You know some superficial version of me.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:08.780]   And my fear for many in this room is that you're gonna go
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.400]   your entire life, and you will have the depth
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.740]   of friendships of an Instagram relationship.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.060]   Today in this room, I would guess the vast majority of us
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.880]   have very few people that we can be real with,
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.280]   we're authentic with, they know us.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.340]   And I know some of us do, and we're pursuing that
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.660]   in community, and we're opening up our lives.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.620]   But thousands listening to me wherever you are,
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.920]   and inside of this room, living this way,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.960]   where it's just basically, I'm terrified of you
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.740]   actually knowing the real me, so I'm gonna put out
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.780]   the me that I think everyone wants.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.600]   And so no one ever gets to love the real you.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.460]   They get to love some manicured version of you.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.260]   And as Christians, we are called to live in the light,
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.660]   and have real relationships marked by living authentically.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.100]   So what does this mean?
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.320]   It means you, in your small group, if you have one,
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.620]   going and sharing about the areas of your life
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.180]   where you're having a hard time,
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.580]   where you are needing God to take work,
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.460]   it means sharing, struggling, things like this.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.260]   Man, I'm struggling this week to believe that God is good
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.340]   because my mom has cancer,
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.100]   and I don't know if it's going away.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.660]   It means sharing, hey, guys, I need to confess,
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.180]   this week I went farther physically than I wanted to,
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.940]   and in my dating relationship with her,
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.260]   I need you to hold me accountable,
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.420]   help me think through boundaries,
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.620]   I wanna bring you guys in, and I just wanna confess
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.380]   that I don't wanna walk in the dark with that.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.700]   It means sharing that, man, I'm really struggling
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.780]   over anxiety about my job, and while I'm at work,
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.900]   what other people think about me,
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.580]   and what I'm gonna do if a layoff happens,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.940]   like you just bring that, and you say,
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.260]   this is where I'm really struggling, will you pray for me?
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.180]   It means being honest about just, there's times we're bent.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.520]   Life can be really hard and sad, and you share, I'm sad.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.900]   I'm sad this week.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.420]   I'm disappointed about my relationship status.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.420]   Like, lots of my friends are moving on
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.620]   to the next phase of life.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.820]   Some of 'em already have kids, maybe most have kids,
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.900]   and I feel like God has forgotten me,
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.140]   and I'm not sure it's gonna happen,
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.740]   and whether or not it will, I just need you to know,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.500]   I'm like a little depressed in this moment,
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.860]   and you bring others in.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.780]   You don't over-spiritualize it and try to pretend like,
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.300]   you know, hey, I lost my job,
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.780]   God, all things work together for good, everything's fine,
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.340]   if you don't actually believe that.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.540]   You don't minimize it and pretend
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.980]   that things are not hard when they are.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.220]   Some of you, like, maybe the biggest takeaway you can have
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.900]   is to learn to not just say, whenever you're like weeping
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.420]   about something really hard in your life,
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.820]   and someone's like, man, I'm so sorry for you,
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.140]   just say, no, everything's fine.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.300]   One thing is a clear, clear signal.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.420]   When someone's bawling about something hard in their life,
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.580]   and they respond with everything's fine,
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.820]   everything is not fine in that moment, and it's okay.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.140]   And as followers of Jesus, the relationship
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.740]   that God designed and wired you for
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.640]   is to be known and loved and cared for,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.600]   and to have that with other Christians inside of your life.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.100]   The challenge I think that most of us get into is like,
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.140]   dude, what are they gonna think?
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.900]   If I bring that to the group, I'm like,
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.020]   I'm anxious about this, I need to confess,
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.100]   I clicked on this, I need to confess,
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.260]   you know, we crossed boundaries physically.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.700]   With my girlfriend, what are they gonna think about me?
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.940]   Let me answer that question really quickly.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.940]   Here's what they're gonna think, ready?
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.860]   They're gonna think you're a lot like them,
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.260]   only really honest.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.380]   They're gonna think, huh,
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.940]   they don't have it together either.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.480]   They're just more honest than I am.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.700]   That's what they're gonna think.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.160]   Let me tell you what they're not gonna think.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.740]   When you bring the group and you're like,
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.140]   hey, look, you know, we've been dating,
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.740]   we're trying to pursue purity,
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.540]   and we messed up this week, here's what we did,
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.060]   you know, hands went places they shouldn't have gone,
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.900]   and you confess that to the group.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.960]   Here's what I've never heard happened.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.460]   The group sits there, oh, huh, okay, yeah, oh, wow, man,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.660]   thanks for sharing that.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.300]   Are you telling me that there's a girl you're dating
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.480]   that you find really attractive and you hope to marry,
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   and that led you to cross boundaries physically?
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.420]   Oh my, what sort of pervert are you?
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.860]   I don't even know what to do with this.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.080]   This is just, my mind is blown, how could you?
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.320]   That's insane.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.400]   Doesn't make it right, and it doesn't make something
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.900]   that you should allow to take place,
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.800]   but it never happens where people are like,
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.720]   I don't even have a category for that, wow,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.240]   you guys really like each other, and what?
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.880]   I've never heard the story of a girl who brought forward,
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.600]   like, man, I'm just struggling, or a guy who brought forward,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.380]   I'm struggling in this season of singleness right now,
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.600]   and I'm just disappointed 'cause, like, my timeline
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   and where I hope to be, I'm realizing it's not possible.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.520]   Like, it's not happening for me,
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.080]   and I never heard the group come around and go,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.960]   what is wrong with you?
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.880]   Trust God already.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.500]   No.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.320]   If they love Jesus, they're gonna be good lovers of people
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.800]   like Jesus was, and they're gonna say, man,
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.840]   thank you for sharing that, let me pray for you,
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.360]   and I'm there, me too, and I have experienced that.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.560]   How can I walk with you and encourage you and remind you?
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.280]   And there's this lie that all of us,
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.680]   as crazy as those lies are, to believe that,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.760]   man, what are they gonna think?
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.520]   They're gonna think you're honest.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.300]   And if they love Jesus, and you should be
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.440]   in authentic relationships with people who love Jesus,
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.000]   they should respond like Christ calls us to.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.440]   The second part of the sentence of, hey,
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.240]   living authentically is living in relationship.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.600]   That's not a typo or being redundant.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.240]   That's included because it means that you should be
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.400]   in ongoing, consistent, continual relationships
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.720]   with a group, with specific people,
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.520]   not just random one-off conversations
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.400]   with a priest that you confess to,
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.800]   not just random one-off conversations
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.400]   with somebody down front,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.840]   not just random one-off conversations
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.880]   with somebody who lives in Omaha
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.920]   and somebody who lives in New York
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.160]   and this friend that you had over here
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.560]   and your mom every once in a while,
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.500]   consistent, ongoing relationships,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.080]   that you would have friendships,
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.320]   that you are authentic and they are in relationship,
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.800]   consistent, ongoing, regular relationships together.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.400]   The Bible says in chapter Hebrews, verse 10,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.780]   that you and I are to do this, verse 24.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.280]   And let us consider how we may spur one another on
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.580]   toward love and good deeds,
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.560]   not neglecting to meet together
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.400]   as some are in the habit of doing,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.320]   but encouraging one another and all the more,
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.940]   as you see the day, which is of Christ returning, approaching.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.860]   So Paul says, hey, don't give up, keep meeting together.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.020]   Some people are in the habit of not meeting together.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.120]   Don't be like those people
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.080]   he anticipates there's gonna be people who are like,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.780]   you know what, I love Jesus,
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.280]   I'm good just being Jesus, no church.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.200]   Paul's like, hey, don't be that guy,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.040]   you don't wanna be him.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.600]   You wanna be someone who continues to meet together.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.080]   And then he uses interesting terms.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.000]   He says, and spur, that's like a horse metaphor.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.680]   Somebody has spurs, they push
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.800]   and they encourage one another towards being more loving
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.420]   and having their life filled with more good things,
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.360]   good deeds that they come alongside and they encourage.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.160]   The relationships where people are going,
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.000]   man, how can I help you be more of the girl
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.160]   that you wanna be, more of the guy that you wanna be,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.360]   more of the husband you wanna be,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.700]   more of the follower of Jesus.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.360]   I wanna be a source of helping you get there
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.120]   and I need you to be a source of that in my life.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.420]   Let me ask you a question before we keep going.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.060]   Do you have those types of relationships?
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.460]   Like, do you have friends in your life
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.020]   that spur you on in your faith?
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.720]   That consistently, not every once in a while,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.080]   not a pastor, not somebody that you met one time
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.800]   or a counselor in isolation or only,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.240]   but people in your life, a group of believers around you
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.600]   that encourage and spur you on
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.720]   to be more of who God calls you to be.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   Like I said, this means, by this,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   I don't mean that if you're walking through,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.940]   you live authentically and you just randomly call
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.000]   and you confess one sin to your friend John over here
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.720]   and then the next week you call Carl who lives over here
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.560]   and then the next week you call Bill who lives over here.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.040]   You have people in your life who know what's going on
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   in that group and you don't meet with them separately,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.200]   that they're all a part of it
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.040]   and you're doing life and walking together.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.760]   This has been some of the guys that,
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.560]   for the last five years, have been in my life,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.040]   all the guys that are at the top,
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.120]   that for the last five years,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.720]   every single Friday morning we've met together for breakfast
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.520]   on Thursday evenings we meet as a group
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.560]   and they have been, they are not impressed with me,
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.680]   they don't think anything about me
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.920]   other than pastors get to be Christians too.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.520]   So we know that you're messed up just like we are
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.960]   and let's all come together and encourage one another.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.280]   And they've walked alongside and prayed for
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.720]   and as we've walked through hard times in our marriage,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.960]   they know where we're struggling,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.520]   they know the temptations that take me out
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.560]   and it's not perfect and we meet together
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.240]   in everyday ordinary moments
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.980]   and we talk about what God is teaching us,
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:19.520]   we talk about where we need to double down
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.680]   and love our wives better,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.880]   we talk about the different ways that we just need God
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.560]   to win in our heart because we're believing different lies.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.680]   And it doesn't, if you were to show up
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.080]   for one Friday morning, you wouldn't be like,
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.920]   oh my gosh, it's like just magical,
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.080]   there's an aura of spirit dust everywhere and wow,
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.980]   it's just like ordinary moments.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:39.800]   And in those moments, when you put them together
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.880]   over time, God does extraordinary things
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.800]   because those authentic relationships
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.120]   where people encourage and you walk together
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.980]   and they support you and they remind you
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.280]   of who you want to or who God calls you to be
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.720]   and call up areas of your life
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.840]   where you're not being the man God calls you to be.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.240]   Those are the ways that God transforms people.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.560]   And it's not a perfect group, there is no perfect group,
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.140]   but do you have a group of people that are in your life
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.500]   walking alongside of you?
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:12.780]   Community or the type of relationships that I'm saying
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.100]   are like any relationships, they are forged, not found.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.780]   Any great relationships are forged, not found.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:25.780]   In other words, they take work, it would be like this.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.780]   It's just like a great marriage, like a great marriage.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   Let me just pop the puzzle,
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.460]   pubble for anybody out there who thinks someday
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.300]   they're gonna get married and they're gonna find the one
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.780]   and this person is gonna be, you know,
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.100]   you wouldn't say you think they're the one
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.440]   'cause you've been around long enough and you're like,
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.940]   I know they don't complete me, they're not the one,
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.780]   but they're pretty great.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.460]   And they're gonna be someone that you're gonna get
[00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.380]   into marriage with and if you wanna have a great marriage,
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.660]   no matter how well you click, you guys like the same,
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.860]   you know, movies, TV shows, sports, songs, everything,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.500]   whatever that is, it's gonna take work
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.820]   to have a great marriage.
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.540]   And if you're sitting and you're engaged right now
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.900]   and you're elbowing like, not us baby,
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.720]   it's always gonna be honeymoon.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.780]   The honeymoon will be over within like a week
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.320]   and then you'll be into a place where you have to work
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.660]   'cause you're like, oh wow, you're a girl
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.580]   and this is not as easy as I thought.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.260]   And she's like, oh man, you're a guy
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.620]   and you smell really bad and this is not as easy
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.620]   as I thought and the work begins because great marriages,
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.460]   like any great relationship, they're forged.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.420]   You don't find them.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.400]   You don't believe me right now or some of y'all don't,
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.820]   but that is the truth.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.900]   They take work, so it is with community
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.860]   that great relationships take work,
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.780]   they take prioritizing, especially when you're post-college.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.900]   Like some of us, for me, some of my closest friends
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.060]   in the world were all in the college phase
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.060]   and they're guys that loved Jesus
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.040]   and that I still to this day keep up with
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.500]   and we're such close friends.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.700]   But the way that we formed relationships then
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.500]   was almost not even fair 'cause you're in college.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.060]   I mean, you're like, dude, we spend all the time together.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.780]   We have three hours of class a day
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.220]   and sometimes we don't even go
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.660]   and then we just do whatever we want
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.260]   and we're at Whataburger till three in the morning
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.220]   and we're living together
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.460]   and you have all of this time to spend together
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.540]   and now you have a job and you live separately
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.300]   and you're meeting people that are in your small group
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.440]   that you've never met before
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.940]   and you're trying to form a relationship
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.540]   and you're like, this isn't as easy as these other friends
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.080]   because you haven't spent as much time with them
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.560]   as you have those other friends.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.840]   It takes prioritizing, pursuing them,
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.640]   being patient and time and working towards that
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.240]   to create those types of relationships.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.760]   And I know, in case you're wondering,
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.880]   if you're sitting in a group,
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.760]   there is not a group out there where there's not times
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.640]   where everybody's like,
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.160]   I don't think I really wanna go tonight.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.920]   I don't think I really wanna be a part of that.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.160]   Every single Friday morning at 6 a.m. I'm like,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.480]   oh, I do not wanna go to this again.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.220]   And then I get there and I always leave going,
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.720]   man, that was such a great reminder.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.660]   I'm so glad I was a part of this.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.640]   So when you're driving in your car and you're like,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.880]   I'm sitting in traffic and I do not wanna be a part of this,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.520]   you're probably doing it right.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:57.960]   And push through and pursue in relationship,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.320]   living authentically with people who are committed to Christ
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.480]   and it's gonna be worth it.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.120]   And in the end, you're gonna win.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:08.500]   Finally, the third component of this sentence
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.700]   of the right relationship to look for
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.420]   is to be living authentically in relationship, ongoing,
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.580]   with people who are committed to Christ.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.840]   People who are committed to Christ,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.100]   not living authentically in relationship
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.380]   with a CrossFit community
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.420]   or living authentically in relationship
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.100]   with a neighborhood around you
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.180]   or living authentically in community with family members.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.020]   None of those.
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.620]   Excuse me, living authentically in community
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.900]   or in relationship with people who are committed to Christ.
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.420]   The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 6, verses 14,
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.180]   a verse that we've read many times before
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.180]   in the context of marriage, but it says,
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.180]   "Do not be yoked or partnered together with unbelievers.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.460]   "For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.820]   "What fellowship can light have with darkness?"
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:01.120]   The apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, verse 33 said this,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.740]   "Do not be misled."
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.860]   As in like, hey, what I'm about to tell you
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.980]   is something where a lot of people get misled.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.140]   They're fools or they don't realize
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.820]   that this is a true thing.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.460]   So don't be misled, don't be like them.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.700]   Here's something you need to know.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.300]   Bad company corrupts good character.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.620]   Who you run with is more powerful than your character.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.540]   Think about that.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.380]   That's what he just said.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.340]   Like that is a crazy verse.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.500]   And Paul says, hey, look, you can be a great character,
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.640]   raised in a great home, make convictions at a deep level
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.080]   that you'll never do X, Y, and Z.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.580]   But if you run with the wrong crowd,
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.860]   you're gonna run in the wrong direction.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.060]   That the company you keep is more powerful
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.620]   than the character you have.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.540]   The company you keep, like who's around you,
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.900]   who's in your inner circle, who speaks into your life,
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.320]   who influences you, who you spend the most time with,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.020]   those people are gonna be more powerful
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.860]   than the convictions that you hold.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.460]   Think about that.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.380]   And that's not an opinion, that is the Bible.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.940]   That's why it's been great.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.100]   It's been rightly summarized.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.120]   All throughout scripture, it says,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.180]   you can see your friends and then see your future,
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.780]   where you're headed towards.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.140]   And Paul says, do not be deceived.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.820]   Who you run with will determine
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.800]   where you're running towards.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.020]   Like think, we've all seen this,
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.580]   in case you're like, really, is it really that powerful?
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.960]   Think about some of the decisions that you made in life
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.140]   and how they were directly connected to who you were around.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.500]   Like some of the decisions, like here's what I know.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.180]   The first time you smoked pot
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.580]   was not in isolation totally by yourself.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.660]   It wasn't one day where you're like, you know what?
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.000]   I feel like pot sounds good, let's try that out.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.120]   Anybody, hey, pot.com, you know where I could get
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.960]   some of this?
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.180]   No, you're around somebody at somebody's house
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.380]   and they're like, hey man, you wanna try?
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.720]   The first time you smoked a cigarette,
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.100]   probably the first time you drank alcohol.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.520]   I mean, think about all the different decisions
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.220]   that you, the way that you formed your perspective
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.520]   on sex and relationships, all of it was directly formed
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.160]   by whoever you ran with.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.540]   It can be incredibly powerful in a negative direction
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.880]   or incredibly powerful in a positive direction.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.360]   That some of you, the reason why you ended up
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.040]   doing a Bible study is 'cause you were hanging out
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.180]   with a friend from work and they were like,
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.960]   hey, do you wanna do this with me this year?
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.280]   And you started doing that and God got ahold of your heart
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.240]   in a unique way.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.640]   Others of you, the way that you date
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.960]   has been directly connected to the people around you
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.760]   because you've had wise guys or wise girls say,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   I don't think she's right for you.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.520]   I don't think this is a good relationship for you to be in.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.560]   And you made the decision, I'm getting out
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.740]   because I continue to hear that same thing
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.280]   from people in my life.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.640]   I remember the first time that I heard somebody talk about,
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.040]   hey, I don't want to be addicted to pornography
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.600]   and so I'm gonna sign up for something
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.640]   called Covenant Eyes, which is this software
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.560]   and I'm gonna send it to you every single week.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.280]   This was like 10 years ago for me.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.880]   And he came over and he told me that at my house
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.640]   and you know what that created in me?
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.280]   A response that said, me too.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.440]   I don't wanna look at this anymore.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.300]   And we got on Covenant Eyes together.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.680]   I don't know that I ever would have done that without him.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.220]   10 years ago.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.900]   And one of my closest friends to this day,
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.460]   who you run with is gonna for good or bad
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.460]   shape the direction that you are running towards.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.020]   Are you running with the right people in your life?
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.380]   And Paul says, hey, I don't care how important,
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.760]   how many times you go under the porch,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.560]   how important like God is to you,
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.740]   how good of a boy or girl your mama raised you to be.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.340]   Bad company trumps that all day long.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.260]   Are you running with the right people in your life?
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.400]   Here's what the right people in your life look like.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.680]   People who are committed to God, committed to Christ,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.880]   if they have that, they're gonna have these qualities
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.760]   because they're committed to Christ's word,
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.180]   the Bible, and living in line with it.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:40.280]   When you find friends who are committed to Christ,
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.000]   they speak the truth in love.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   Ephesians chapter four verse 29 says.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Like they wanna speak the truth to you,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.400]   not to beat you over the head,
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.600]   but because they love you and do so in a loving way.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.080]   They mourn with you when you mourn
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.060]   and they rejoice with you when you rejoice.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.080]   Romans chapter 12 verse 15 says.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.000]   They come alongside and when it's hard,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.880]   they're there for you.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.480]   When things are going great, they celebrate with you.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.080]   They counsel you from God's word.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.120]   Colossians chapter three verse 16.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.600]   That they don't give you their opinion,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.100]   like hey, I saw on Ellen the other day
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.280]   that maybe we should do this.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   That they say, I think God has something to say
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.640]   about this issue and they speak from God's word
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.940]   and counsel your life in that direction.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.000]   They're willing to say hard truths
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.440]   that even if they think it's going to wound you,
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.320]   if it is something that you may not be aware of
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.280]   or in order to protect you,
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.240]   something you may not see,
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.760]   they're willing to call out blind spots.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.740]   That's Proverbs chapter 27 verse six.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.440]   I mean, this one alone is just so huge.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.840]   I mean, you guys remember the show,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.960]   is American Idol still on?
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.800]   It is?
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.620]   Is it back?
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.920]   Anyway, whether it's back or not,
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.960]   at one point in time, American Idol was a thing
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.160]   and if you watch that show,
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.000]   you know what I'm talking about
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.120]   where every single season,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.560]   there were the people who could go on there
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.640]   and they could sing
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.280]   and then there were the people who could go on there
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.200]   and they could not.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.840]   And you would watch and you would always think like,
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.600]   how has no one ever told you this before?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.640]   Like how are you singing Gangnam Style right now
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.560]   in front of 30 million Americans
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.520]   and everyone is laughing at you right now?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   How did nobody in your entire life go,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.960]   hey dude, you can't sing, bro.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.840]   You do not need to be doing this.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.440]   Are you really?
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.440]   Because they never had any faithful friend
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.280]   that was willing to say,
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.360]   hey man, we're going to find you like another hobby,
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.000]   like basket weaving or something
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.400]   and this is not really what I think you're called to do.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.240]   How?
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.920]   And the same thing,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.480]   tragically is true for a lot of us in the room.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.280]   That you've never had a real friend in your life
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.400]   and you've been in one like messed up relationship
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.760]   after the next, after the next, after the next
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.880]   and like you get around people
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.400]   who are like actually truth tellers
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.280]   and you begin to describe your dating relationship
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.880]   and just how you always date these deadbeat jerk guys
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.480]   and one after the next
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.280]   and they were able to say,
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.480]   I think the common denominator is you.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.040]   Has anyone ever told you that you may be the reason
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.280]   why you continue to be deadbeat guys?
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.040]   And you've never had anybody speak truth
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.880]   like that in your life.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.640]   You've never had anybody willing to say like,
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.760]   hey, I think you need,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.720]   I think you're bitter towards your dad.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.280]   It feels like,
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.240]   it sounds like you may hold a grudge towards him.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.080]   Am I right?
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.080]   Maybe I'm wrong,
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.760]   but willing to say,
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.280]   not what they want you to hear
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.440]   or not what they know that you want to hear.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.160]   They're like, man, I love God and I love you
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.160]   more than I love what you think about me
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.440]   or more than I love what I want you to think about me
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.640]   and more than I need you to like me
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.080]   because I love you
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.440]   and if I'm obsessed with you liking me,
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.600]   I may not be able to love you
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.960]   if it means telling you something that's hard to hear.
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.800]   Do you have friends like that in your life?
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.120]   Friends that are committed to Christ
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.080]   will encourage you when you're faint hearted,
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.160]   when you're just, man, I'm just exhausted.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.280]   They're generous towards you
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.560]   and your needs as a source of provision in your life
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.960]   that when you're financially in a hard place,
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.040]   they're coming around you,
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.260]   hoping to make ends meet, pay bills, cover things.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.280]   They forgive you when you hurt them.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.520]   Colossians chapter three, verse 13.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.640]   Generous was Acts chapter two, verse 45.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.280]   They forgive you when you hurt them as Christ forgave them.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.560]   They don't hold onto grudges.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.800]   They're not like you hurt me by Felicia,
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.240]   peace, I'm out of here.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.120]   That they work through hurts with you.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.000]   They work through conflict.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.880]   Ephesians chapter four, verse three says,
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.440]   they're diligent to work through conflict.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.520]   When you hurt them, they move towards you
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.880]   'cause they wanna see it resolved
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.720]   for the sake of being unified.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.360]   Do you have relationships like that?
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.280]   By implication, the other thing that,
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.760]   takeaway from this is that it's not even
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.600]   just having the right relationships in your life,
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.200]   it is removing the wrong relationships from your life.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.480]   And this next two minutes is gonna be the thing
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.560]   that some of you listen to
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.560]   and it's gonna change your life forever.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.760]   Am I saying that there may be people in your life
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.720]   that you need to go and say,
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.680]   hey, I don't think we can hang out anymore.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.160]   Like we can't hang out in the same way at least anymore.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.400]   Yes.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.960]   And I know you're going, dude, what are you saying?
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.800]   Are you kidding me?
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.640]   Like we're boys.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.760]   You know how much we've been through?
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.240]   I mean, we've been through all types of stuff.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.680]   I mean, this dude was here for me
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.240]   when I went through the darkest moments in my life.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.920]   I mean, they've been in my life forever.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.400]   You tell me I just need to ghost them and walk away?
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.800]   No, but I am telling them you need to sit them down
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.320]   and step away and have a conversation and say,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.920]   if it's true, I'm not sure that we can be friends
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.560]   in the same way we have been.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.800]   At least right now.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.920]   Like I love taking them to lunch.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:47.760]   You sit them down.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.640]   You say, I feel like God is doing something in my life
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.600]   and I'm trying to focus on my relationship with him,
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.280]   which means I can't spend the weekend partying anymore.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.800]   I'm not sure I can come to your bachelor party in a month.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.200]   Like just the stuff that's gonna be there,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.800]   I feel like it's gonna pull me down.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.680]   And it's not because I think I'm better than you.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.200]   I just think I'm better off following Jesus
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.040]   than I have been.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   And so this is the change I'm making right now.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.000]   And so I still wanna spend time with you.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.040]   I still love you.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.760]   If you wanna come with me to small group to church,
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.880]   I wanna hang out with you.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.480]   Just maybe not at happy hour and maybe not at the bar
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   and maybe not at the places that we have been,
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.760]   at least right now.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:24.000]   You don't ghost, you don't just go radio silent.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.800]   You speak the truth in love.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.080]   And if you're thinking like, hey, what if they're like,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.760]   oh, oh, okay, really?
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.080]   Oh, you can't go to the bar anymore?
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.000]   What's up with that, dude?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.840]   You don't care about me?
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.280]   Oh, you're so much better than me now since you found Jesus?
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   May I suggest that if someone only wants to hang out with you
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.000]   if it involves alcohol,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.600]   maybe they're not as close of a friend as you think.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.880]   If someone only wants to hang out with you
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.640]   if it involves whatever thing God says
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.940]   shouldn't be in your life,
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:59.680]   they may not be as close as you think.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.200]   But yes, the scripture does say,
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.880]   you will walk with the right people
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.580]   and have the type of relationships around you
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.160]   where you live authentically in relationship with people
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.520]   who are committed to Christ.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.240]   Some of you tonight is your night
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.920]   and you're gonna take a step
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.880]   that is gonna totally transform
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.840]   who you're gonna be in 2030.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.040]   You're gonna go up the first step,
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.280]   you're gonna take your first step,
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.480]   you're gonna get plugged into a church,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.720]   you're gonna get into community
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.480]   and you're gonna experience life change.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.160]   You're gonna experience more of what Jesus called you to be,
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.000]   more who you were made to be.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.480]   Others of you are not gonna listen,
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.820]   you're gonna continue in relationships
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.500]   that are gonna continue pulling you down
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.000]   and one day you're gonna wake up
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.140]   and you're gonna remember this message
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.160]   or maybe you're gonna have a friend
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.680]   that invites you back again,
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.720]   you're gonna be reminded that,
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.160]   oh, God does love me, he hasn't forgotten me,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.760]   he wants me to experience life
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.000]   and one of the ways that he designed that to be experienced
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.840]   is through relationships with other Christians in my life
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.040]   and that day you're gonna get it, hopefully.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.360]   Let me close by saying this.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.560]   If you could have a friendship or be in a relationship,
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.720]   non-romantic one, with anybody on the planet,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.880]   I want you to just think to yourself,
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.200]   who would I want to be friends with?
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.040]   Like a person, anybody on the planet.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.400]   You could be friends with Justin Bieber,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.920]   you could be friends with Selena,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.560]   you could be friends with you-do-you,
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:24.760]   whoever you would be excited about being friends with.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.360]   This would be the person, maybe it's a mentor,
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.600]   Mark Cuban, I'd love, in the business world,
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.160]   I'd love to have a friendship with this person.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.400]   Who would that person be?
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.360]   If that person and the qualities
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.760]   that make you want to be their friend
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.800]   did not include the quality or the top of those qualities,
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.880]   godliness, that they love Jesus,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.240]   they're someone that I admire in their walk with him,
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.120]   they're someone who is a godly person,
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.300]   who I want to have a relationship with
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.380]   because every time I'm around them,
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.720]   they make me want to be more like Jesus.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.440]   Your priorities are off or at least not biblical
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.920]   and the god who's there wants you to have relationships
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.560]   and they will show you your future.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.000]   Do you have the right ones?
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.760]   If you're here and this is the first time,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.600]   maybe you've been back in church in a while
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.320]   or maybe you are still trying to figure
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.240]   this entire god thing or Jesus thing out,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.800]   here's what I want you to hear me say.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.520]   What you need to do is not take the first step
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.840]   of going and getting into a small group,
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.680]   you need to take a first step in responding to the god
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.040]   who's already stepped towards you.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.680]   I asked the question, if you could be in a friendship
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.280]   or relationship with anybody on the planet,
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.120]   who would it be?
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.040]   Do you know how God answered that question?
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.840]   Do you know how God would answer that question?
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.440]   Hey God, if you could be in a relationship
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.520]   with anybody out there, who would it be?
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.440]   You.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.960]   The god who's there, and listen to me,
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.760]   the god who is there has not woven creation
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.360]   into such a way where he's waiting for you
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.640]   to work your way towards him,
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   that he wants you to strive and get your life together
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.200]   and clean yourself up and stop doing that
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.080]   and put yourself together,
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.400]   and then you can have a relationship.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.520]   He's a god who so desperately wants to be
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.560]   in a relationship with you,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.720]   he went to the furthest extent possible
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.480]   by sending his own son to die in your place.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   And he did so by paying for all the sin in your life,
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.360]   every sin in my life, every sin inside of this room,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.760]   every sin that has ever been done by anyone listening,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.840]   whether you're there right now
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.880]   or at some future date on the podcast,
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.120]   every person, all of it, paid for,
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.760]   because he wanted to have a relationship with you
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.840]   because he answered that question.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.320]   Who would I want most? You.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.080]   And so many people have bought the lie
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.840]   that the god who's there wants to rip them off,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.000]   he wants you to follow a bunch of rules,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.040]   you need to be in church a bunch,
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.720]   you need to read your Bible X number of times,
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.000]   and then you could have a relationship,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.840]   and it is a lie from hell.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.760]   God is so crazy about you,
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   he sent his own son to make a way
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.880]   so that despite anything and everything you've ever done,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.200]   all the ways that you don't deserve to have a relationship,
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.200]   you could have one, not by earning it,
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.200]   but by accepting it, by saying,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.360]   I believe, I believe it's true.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:07.880]   God, you came, you reset the calendar, 2020 years,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:09.320]   you died in my place,
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.880]   I don't think I'm good enough
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.840]   to have a relationship with God.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.280]   I don't think I'm good enough to go to heaven,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.040]   but I believe that you paid for my sin
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.720]   and you rose from the grave, you conquered death,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.200]   and I believe in that,
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.240]   and I receive, if it's possible, that free gift,
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.360]   and I'm not trusting in me, I'm trusting in you,
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.200]   and that moment, that relationship that you were made for
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:37.480]   begins, and every relationship in this earthly life
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.440]   will fall short if it doesn't,
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.840]   and is not grounded and founded on that relationship
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.680]   with one another.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.720]   Let me pray.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.820]   Father, thank you.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.040]   That despite every way that we have tried to satisfy,
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.320]   the loneliness, the aches,
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   the anger, the places in our soul
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.880]   that are crying out for you,
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:20.040]   and we try to fill them with sex, pleasure, or success,
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.680]   despite all of that, you died in our place.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:26.840]   You gave your life
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   so that we would not just have good friendships here,
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.920]   but we could be a friend of God forever.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.120]   And so, Father, I pray for anyone in this room
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.080]   who's never received that free gift.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.560]   Your spirit would now do what only it can do,
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.480]   and allow them to trust not in how good they are,
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.540]   or bad they are, but in you.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.600]   I pray for people in this room
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.000]   who don't have real relationships,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.880]   they're lonely, they're anxious,
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.080]   they feel like no one cares, and they're afraid
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.600]   of what if someone knew?
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:04.360]   That you would break through the walls,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.760]   and you would move them just by your spirit
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.520]   to take the next step,
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:13.360]   whether that's opening up to their small group,
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.200]   or getting plugged into a church, this one or another one.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.280]   Father, would you help us?
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.320]   We are weak.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.080]   And we know that in our weakness, you are strong,
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.760]   and you've given us community to encourage
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.120]   and help one another.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:31.240]   Would we lean on that, and walk with others,
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.800]   and experience all the life and a decade ahead of us
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.640]   that roars through your provision
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.120]   of the gift of the people of God?
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.280]   In Christ's name, amen.
