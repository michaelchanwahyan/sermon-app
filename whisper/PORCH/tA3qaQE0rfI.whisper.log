[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.200]   - We're live, everybody, welcome.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.500]   It's hard to tell in here, normally the lights come up.
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.340]   This is fun.
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.080]   Guys, if we haven't met yet, my name is Josh Timms
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.080]   and I get to be a part of leading the porch
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.960]   over in Fort Worth, shout out to Fort Worth.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.540]   And similar, just actually not similar,
[00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.880]   exactly the same as you heard,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.000]   here in Dallas they are reopening.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.600]   We are also reopening next week in Fort Worth.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.560]   So we would love to have you join us.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.160]   And so here's where I'd like to start this evening.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.940]   Who in here likes the, like New Year's resolutions?
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880]   Anyone in here do New Year's resolutions?
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.640]   Few of you guys and some friends joining me, okay.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.880]   I love them, I think they're great.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.480]   It makes me feel like I'm moving the needle, you know.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.760]   I feel, there's times where I've felt good about them
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.880]   even if I haven't done them,
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.360]   but I love New Year's resolutions.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.080]   And there was a year that I decided
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640]   for my New Year's resolution, I am quitting sugar
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.080]   or at least all things sweet, okay.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.320]   I'm cutting sugar out, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.720]   I'm gonna be fit, it'll be awesome.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.760]   And there was one, there was like one singular thing
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.880]   that I was like, this is going,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.680]   if anything's gonna take me out,
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.000]   there's gonna be one thing that robs me
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.220]   of fulfilling my year commitment to a year without sugar,
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.480]   and it was donuts.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.720]   And to be really specific,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.220]   it was the original Krispy Kreme donuts, okay.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.060]   You feel me?
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.040]   Yes, because without, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.200]   it is the best donut out there.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   And so I knew that to be the case.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.380]   And so friends, I pulled it off.
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.160]   I mean, largely, there's a Gatorade here too.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.440]   I forgot that I drank a little sugar,
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.160]   but for the, largely I spent an entire year without sugar.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.840]   But during the year I thought about donuts
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.800]   and I was like, man, it'll be awesome.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.040]   And finally the day came.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.320]   It had been a year, I fulfilled my commitment.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.180]   It is time, we all know what's happened.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.600]   I'm getting some donuts.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.440]   So I'm excited about it.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.940]   I drive up to Krispy Kreme.
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.780]   It's amazing.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.040]   It feels like I can smell it from miles away.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.940]   If you guys have ever been there,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.280]   when it like rolls right off the like belt
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.620]   and it like melts in your mouth,
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.460]   and I'm excited about this.
[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.580]   And I get there and my girlfriend now,
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.180]   girlfriend at the time, wife now had said,
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.220]   you know what, you should just have one,
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.340]   you know, just one donut.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.180]   Get there, I'm like, yes, I will have a whole box.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.180]   I'll take 12 of them.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.300]   And then I was like, yeah, I'll just take 12 of them
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.860]   and then just leave them at home.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.300]   And I'll just have one now.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.480]   And then for the next 11 days,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.980]   and I wholeheartedly did not follow that advice either.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.980]   And I ate all 12 delicious donuts in one setting.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.060]   And it was amazing.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.580]   It really was, it was incredible.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.280]   I loved it in the moment, absolutely amazing.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.740]   And then there was something interesting that happened.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.980]   I didn't see this coming.
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.380]   We're like, man, it's like my stomach
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.940]   started to like not feel good.
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.460]   And then I went from like not feeling good
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.380]   to where I spent most of the rest of my day
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.120]   on the porcelain crown of my home.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.460]   Like that's just where I was, friends.
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.300]   It messed me up.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.620]   There was things happening inside of me
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.660]   that I didn't know could happen inside of me.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.620]   And all because what I had done is I had taken this desire
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.940]   and turned it into this like, man,
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.360]   fully indulging on everything that I wanted.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.420]   And the reason I start this tonight
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.940]   is because we are going to talk about two sins
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.180]   the Bible identifies as deadly,
[00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.540]   and that is laziness and gluttony.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.580]   Laziness and gluttony.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.700]   And I just wrote some definitions down
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.140]   so we can have an understanding.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.900]   We're all talking the same language.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.620]   And gluttony is just this, it's excessive consumption.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.040]   It's excessive consumption.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.580]   We often think of it in relation to food,
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.900]   but it's not limited to that.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.340]   And then laziness is really the avoidance of effort
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.580]   or responsibility.
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.340]   And at the core, they really are both
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.500]   like seeking to gratify self.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.140]   And so for our purposes this evening,
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.060]   I'm going to put them under one umbrella of self-indulgence.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.460]   And self-indulgence, I just wrote this down.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.300]   You can do it as well.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.980]   Self-indulgence is excessive or unrestrained gratification
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.420]   of one's own appetites.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.460]   And friends, I want you to listen closely this evening,
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.620]   and it's incredibly important because genuinely,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.620]   I believe that everything that you want in life
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.580]   rises and falls on your ability
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.420]   to master your self-indulgence.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.620]   Like your future career depends on whether or not
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.060]   you're able to master your self-indulgence.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.020]   Your future marriages depend on whether or not
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.380]   you can master your self-indulgence.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.340]   And if I'm just really honest,
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.420]   especially in the United States of America,
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.100]   I believe that self-indulgence is responsible
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.660]   for sending more people to hell than any other sin.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.120]   It's incredibly important.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.620]   And it's something that every single one of us deals with.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.380]   There's not a single person listening
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.500]   here in the room tonight that doesn't deal
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   with the desire to self-indulge.
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.340]   And so tonight we're gonna talk through three things.
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.740]   We're gonna talk through the presence of self-indulgence,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.540]   the problem of self-indulgence,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.920]   and the path to true satisfaction.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.500]   Before we jump in tonight, I would just like
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.140]   to take a moment, I'm gonna pray for us before we jump in,
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.020]   and just would invite you to pray for me
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.320]   as we open God's word and see what he has to say.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.560]   Father, thank you for the opportunity to open your word,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.320]   to sit underneath your truth,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   to understand what you have to tell us about how to live,
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.000]   and that life to the full is found in you.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.040]   And Father, I pray that tonight
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   for every person listening, Father,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.920]   that you would do an amazing, incredible work in their life,
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.360]   that you would give us all humility
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.300]   to sit underneath the truth of your word,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.120]   that we might be changed to look more like you.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.760]   And Father, I just ask and pray selfishly for myself
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.160]   that, man, you would be with my words
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.600]   that anything that I would say that is not in line with you,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.160]   that it would be forgotten.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.720]   And Father, may we come, may we end our evening
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.760]   just being more in love and more excited about you.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.040]   You know, I pray, amen.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.720]   Okay, friends, for the first point
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.320]   where we're gonna jump in first this evening
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.200]   is in the text, Philippians chapter three.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.080]   And so before we get to Philippians chapter three,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.640]   just to pull our first point out,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.720]   I'm gonna set up a little bit of context here.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.680]   Paul is writing to the church in Philippi, okay?
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.000]   He's writing to church in Philippi,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.480]   and here in chapter three, what he's doing
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.720]   is he's calling out false teachers.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.640]   He's calling out false teachers
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.660]   that have been placing these like expectations
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.360]   on other believers that were not in line with God's word,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.440]   and he's exposing their false doctrine.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.280]   And so that's where we're at,
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.560]   Philippians chapter three, verses 17 through 19.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.800]   If you've got your Bibles, open them up and follow along.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.000]   Paul says this, "Dear brothers and sisters,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.920]   "pattern your lives after mine
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.460]   "and learn from those who follow our example.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.060]   "For I have told you often before,
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.480]   "and I say it again with tears in my eyes,
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.980]   "that there are many whose conduct shows
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.440]   "that they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.320]   "They are headed for destruction.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.980]   "Their God is their appetite.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.600]   "They brag about shameful things
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   "and they think only about this life here on earth."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.520]   So the first thing we're gonna talk through this evening
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.360]   is the presence of self-indulgence,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.040]   the presence of self-indulgency.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.080]   I think that laziness,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.480]   we believe that laziness and gluttony
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.120]   should be really easy to recognize.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.480]   Like in our minds, it's kind of like,
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.300]   hey, you know, laziness and gluttony,
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.980]   that's like the guy who doesn't have a job
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.600]   and he still lives in like mom and dad's basement, you know?
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.000]   And gluttony, that's the person who like lays on the couch
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.780]   and eat potato chips all day long.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.600]   So really, we just kind of shrink it down,
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.240]   you know, to overeating really.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.160]   And we shrink it down to overeating and being overweight.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.560]   And I think what happens when we do that,
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.040]   when we shrink those things down
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.560]   to just being overweight or overeating,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.000]   I think that it's easy for us to go, oh, that's not me.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.940]   That's not, like, that isn't, like laziness and gluttony,
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.280]   that's like for other people, but that's not really me.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   And here's the thing,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.960]   self-indulgence is incredibly more subtle than that.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.920]   It's incredibly more subtle.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.820]   Like gluttony doesn't always look like being 400 pounds.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.440]   Like here's what gluttony could look like.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.160]   It could look like you're in the gym every single day
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.760]   so that on the weekends,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.400]   you can drink as much beer as you want and not get fat.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.560]   I actually remember that conversation when I was college.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.080]   It could also look like this.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.520]   Laziness could look like this.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.960]   You know, we've all been here.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.840]   Maybe you guys haven't been here,
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.280]   but I'm here a lot 'cause I own a truck.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   You got that one friend who's moving, you know?
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.680]   So they call you up, you got the truck,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.560]   and you get a text from them,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.680]   and you know what that text is about.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   And so you leave that text unread
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.800]   so that you can truthfully tell them like,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.720]   "Hey, I'm so sorry after you've moved in.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.480]   "I hadn't read my text yet."
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.320]   Okay?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.560]   It hides itself in our lives,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.960]   which is what makes it so deadly.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.880]   It's because it isn't always easy
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.000]   for us to recognize in our lives.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.240]   In fact, if I'm really honest,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.640]   it shows up in a place inside of my heart
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.440]   where what I want to do is I want to work really hard.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.960]   Like I wanna like hit the grind really hard
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.960]   so at 35 I can retire
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.160]   and then spend the rest of my life
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.040]   like in swim trunks on the beach.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.880]   You know?
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.280]   And so it doesn't look like it.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.400]   You're like, "Oh, that is not really,
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.280]   "is it discipline?"
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.480]   No, I'm telling you, like I want to work hard
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   so that later on in life
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.960]   that I can just essentially do whatever I want
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.160]   whenever I want.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.960]   And if we're honest,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.560]   none of us actually think that we're self-indulgent.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.600]   And the reason we don't think it
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.360]   is because we justify our actions.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.440]   Maybe you can relate to this.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.960]   Like, "Yeah, man, I've just had a hard day at work.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.200]   "So like I deserve this glass of wine."
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.840]   Or maybe, "Man, I don't need to work hard at my job
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.680]   "because if I'm honest,
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.720]   "I'm just not really passionate about it."
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.040]   Or, "Man, I just had a really tough conversation, you know,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.440]   "and so I need me just a little retail therapy."
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.640]   Or for here, I'll just welcome you into my life this week.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.600]   "Come Saturday, and I just had a long week at work,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.820]   "and there was a part of me that's like,
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.360]   "Man, this has been a stressful week.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.160]   "And so I feel like it's okay for me to sleep in till 10
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.520]   "and neglect responsibilities that I have."
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.080]   That's inside all of us.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.720]   See, none of us think that we're self-indulgent
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.920]   because it is hidden inside of us.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.400]   But yet Paul is saying here in Philippians
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.340]   that our actions reveal our hearts.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.160]   Paul tells us that our actions,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.800]   really, they expose our self-indulgence.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.960]   I mean, I'll read it to you again.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.160]   He says, "For I have told you often before,"
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.000]   and I say it again with tears in my eyes,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.120]   "that there are many whose conduct shows
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.700]   "they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.640]   "They are headed for destruction.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.400]   "Their God is their appetite.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.700]   "They brag about shameful things,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.120]   "and they think only about this life here on earth."
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.780]   Self-indulgence is present in your life
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.500]   when your appetite is your God.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.340]   What do I mean by that?
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.680]   What do I mean by your appetite?
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.520]   What I mean by appetite is just your desires
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.940]   and your cravings, okay?
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.680]   Not just a appetite for food or drink,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.400]   but like your desires and your cravings.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   And then what does it mean?
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.920]   What do I mean when making your appetite your God?
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.580]   It just means God, making something a God in your life
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.600]   means your whole life revolves and centers around it.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.920]   Okay, so to make your appetite your God
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.360]   just means that your life revolves around satisfying
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.920]   your desires and your cravings.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.780]   Plainly, what it means is that our life revolves around us.
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.500]   And if we see here in the text,
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.520]   man, Paul says some things that just hit home here for me.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.380]   They sound really harsh,
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.420]   but I think he's trying to wake,
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.980]   he's trying to like shake us out of like,
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.180]   "No, no, this isn't just something that's outside
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.680]   "or just for those people over there,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.260]   "but it's inside of all of our hearts,
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.960]   "this desire to self-indulge."
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.600]   And he says some three things that I think are really crazy.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.160]   He says, "Man, if that's you, if that's me,
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.420]   "your life is headed for destruction.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.620]   "You're gonna have a life that is marked
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.220]   "by shameless selfishness,
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.360]   "and it will not matter in eternity."
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   Friends, our appetites were never meant to be our God.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.160]   God is meant to be God.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.440]   And here's what's crazy.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.160]   And you guys, we all know this,
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.000]   we all understand this,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.140]   that appetites don't shrink when you feed them,
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.880]   they grow.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.700]   Like the more that you consume,
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.280]   the more that you want to consume.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.560]   And so what makes them such a terrible God in our lives
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.040]   is that one, they're never satisfied,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.700]   and then they're always changing.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.520]   God is meant to be God in our lives.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.920]   And so, man, I wanna like care for you,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:51.980]   but there's some of you in the room,
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.720]   I can't help but feel like maybe hearing this
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.000]   and just invalidating me like,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.080]   "Man, hold on, Josh, like, look, yes,
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.960]   "I'll like have a drink or two,
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.360]   "but like, I don't need those things.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.980]   "Like, I don't need a drink.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.200]   "I don't need the food, the chocolate bar.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.000]   "I don't need to play video games."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.440]   Great, prove it.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.440]   Like, don't do that for a week.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.040]   I'm not saying that because those things are bad,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.080]   but because there's often self-indulgences
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.760]   hiding inside of our hearts,
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.680]   and our conduct shows and reveals that inside of us.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.080]   And so, man, those things in our life that we crave,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.360]   that we desire, I'm not saying your desires,
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.500]   your cravings are bad,
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.720]   or that you can't fulfill them and satisfy them in moments.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.760]   What I am saying is that
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.980]   they may not be as innocent as you think.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.200]   And you may be feeding your self-indulgence.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.040]   And so, just to recap,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.040]   self-indulgence is often more present than we believe.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.340]   And so now, with an understanding
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.020]   of just how present self-indulgence is in our hearts,
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.900]   let's see if we can understand the danger.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.220]   So if all of us are dealing with it,
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.180]   what is the problem, why is it so bad?
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.260]   And why is it so dangerous?
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:10.560]   And we're gonna be in James 1, just two verses, 14 and 16.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.640]   And just to set this up, James readers at this point,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.500]   he's writing this letter to these people
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.980]   who are suffering persecution at the time.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.400]   And they're living in poverty,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.900]   and a lot of them were living,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.720]   they were believers living just like really worldly,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.780]   completely apart from what God had to say.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.680]   And James is correcting them and challenging them
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.120]   to turn back to God.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.740]   And here's what he says, it's James 1, verses 14 and 16.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.380]   He says, "Temptation comes from our own desires,
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.340]   which entice us and drag us away.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.020]   These desires give birth to sinful actions.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.020]   And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.540]   So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters."
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.700]   My second point tonight,
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.700]   the second thing I'm gonna talk through this evening
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   is the problem, the problem of self-indulgence.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.300]   And it starts, here's where the problem is.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.220]   It all starts with the desire.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.780]   Self-indulgence begins at its very core,
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.780]   just a desire in our hearts.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.140]   And here's the thing, every single one of us
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.140]   desires to be full, to be content, and to be happy.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.440]   So what that means is you and I,
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.620]   we pursue things that make us that promise.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.660]   Like anything that promises that it's going to fulfill
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.180]   those desires, we pursue those things,
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.500]   which means that we often self-indulge.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.160]   It just means that when we feel these desires,
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.620]   which if you're anything like me,
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.180]   any desire that you have, you feel really strongly.
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.800]   And so we believe that self-indulgence
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.060]   is going to be the thing that appeases
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.080]   that desire or that craving.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.220]   We self-indulge because doing whatever feels good
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.860]   in the moment is what we want.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.900]   And the problem James explains here
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:08.900]   is that we are believing a lie or at least a half-truth.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.360]   And if you go back and I'm gonna reread those verses to you
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.920]   because James in this moment uses
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.600]   a really jarring illustration,
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.700]   explaining just how this sin in our heart
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.020]   that hides itself in here and how we all deal with it,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.820]   he uses a really jarring illustration
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.420]   to show us just how painful and dangerous it is.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.260]   I'm gonna read this again.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.820]   It says, "Temptation comes from our own desires,
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.760]   "which entice us and drag us away.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.300]   "These desires give birth," or in your version,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.800]   I might say, "conceive sinful actions.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.740]   "And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.980]   "So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters."
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.880]   The illustration is one of a stillborn.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.340]   And it's really sobering.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.260]   I've had friends who have been pregnant
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.180]   and then had a miscarriage.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.180]   And here's what's so jarring about it
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.820]   is that when someone is pregnant,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.760]   you're like, "Man, there's life in there.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.020]   "This is exciting."
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.780]   I recently, two months ago, my wife and I had our first kid.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.620]   I mean, it's exciting.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.340]   There's amazement.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.380]   There's anticipation and you can't wait.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.160]   And then you go from, "There's life in there.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.260]   "There's life found there.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.580]   "There's life in there," to like, "Life is not there."
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.980]   Leads to pain and sadness.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.300]   And what James is trying to do
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.380]   is that he's trying to tell you and I
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.700]   that we often are going to think,
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.240]   "There's life found in indulging in what I want.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.460]   "There's life found in satisfying my desires."
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.340]   But he's going, "Don't do that.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.180]   "Don't believe that.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:51.540]   "There's not life there.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.460]   "And if you believe there's life there,
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.460]   "it is only going to lead to pain and sadness in your life."
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:03.620]   Self-indulgence works exactly the same way.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.180]   You think there's life there, but in the end, there isn't.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.660]   And so often, at least for me,
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.380]   I remember when I first started reading the Bible,
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.200]   it's easy for me, like,
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.640]   "Man, he's saying that sin leads to death,
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.060]   "but like, man, I just slept with my girlfriend.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.820]   "I didn't fall over dead.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.060]   "And so I don't know if I can trust the Bible."
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.700]   Let me do as best as I can, walk you through what I mean
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.620]   and what James is saying when he says
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.380]   that sin leads to death.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.020]   You see, when self-indulgence becomes a habit,
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.620]   it consumes all of your time and energy,
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.100]   meaning all of your time and energy
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.620]   becomes focused around you just getting what you want.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.360]   And what happens with that is it gives you
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.780]   or you begin to have a decline in your motivation
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.860]   and in your health.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.420]   And so a lack of time and energy in a job
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.820]   often leads to a death of a job.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.460]   Proverbs 10 says this, Proverbs 10, 11 and 12,
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.900]   "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.920]   "a little folding of the hands to rest,
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.420]   "then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.020]   "and scarcity will attack you like an armed robber."
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.780]   A lack of time and energy for relationships
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.220]   can lead to the death of a friendship.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.420]   A self-consumed friend is a really bad friend.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.700]   A self-consumed friend is not a friend
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.340]   that stays a friend very long.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.680]   And friends, if you and I continue,
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.260]   if we continue just to indulge,
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.820]   if we continue just to satisfy our own desires in the moment,
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.380]   do what we want, when we want in the moment,
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.220]   it really does lead in practical ways,
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.700]   death in our life here on earth,
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.700]   and then really in a much bigger and much more serious way,
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.100]   it can lead to death spiritually and for eternity.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.660]   How?
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.500]   I'll explain.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.380]   When you and I believe that life is centered around me
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.140]   getting what I want, what we are saying
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.060]   and what we are believing is that I'm God of my life.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.660]   God isn't God of my life, I'm God of my life.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.780]   And if you have taken over the throne
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.660]   where only God is supposed to stand,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.340]   that means there is a, you and God are not reconciled,
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.840]   which means when the end of your physical life comes,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.120]   it means eternal, eternally you'll be separated from him.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:32.060]   Friends, I want to implore you, James is imploring you,
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.160]   do not be misled.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.780]   There's not life there.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.620]   And we're not alone, I do this.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.140]   Like it is so easy for me to go like just in the moment,
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.420]   the easiest thing for me to do is whatever I want to do.
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.980]   And I just have to be reminded
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.260]   that ultimately there's not life there.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.980]   Laziness and gluttony always over promise
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.020]   and under deliver.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:07.220]   And so if self-indulgence equals making our appetite our God
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.320]   and if we self-indulge because we buy the lie
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.820]   that it will satisfy,
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.420]   a life marked by self-indulgence is going to lead to death.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.380]   And so my next point for this evening is just,
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.700]   we're gonna walk through the path to real satisfaction.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.780]   We're gonna walk through the path to real satisfaction.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.900]   And just to go back to the problem of self-indulgence,
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.100]   if you're a note taker is this,
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.040]   it makes a promise that it can't deliver.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.900]   The problem of self-indulgence is that it makes a promise
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.460]   that it can't deliver.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.100]   And so we're gonna be in Matthew chapter five
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.620]   and this is the beginning of Jesus' most famous sermon.
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.580]   It's called the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.380]   And he begins with the Beatitudes
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.200]   and he says something incredibly radical,
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.260]   incredibly radical because how are we to do this?
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.340]   'Cause if you're anything like me,
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.540]   I'm a little bit like, man, I've got like strong desires
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.980]   and I don't know how I can move
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.900]   from not choosing to do what I want, when I want.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.180]   How is it that I make it there?
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.500]   And Jesus just says it really plainly.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.260]   Matthew five, chapter six, he said,
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.260]   "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:18.520]   "for they will be satisfied."
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.620]   He makes us a promise.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.100]   You see the promise of self-indulgence
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:23.940]   that it doesn't deliver on
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.900]   is that you're going to be satisfied.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.580]   And even though you may in a moment feel satisfied,
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.580]   in the end, it doesn't deliver.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.300]   Jesus says, "Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.500]   "shall be satisfied."
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.740]   And so our path, the beginning of a path
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.420]   towards satisfaction is to hunger and thirst
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.480]   for what alone satisfies.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.540]   And here's where I want you guys to understand something.
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.500]   Your desires, your cravings, the fact that you want more,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.340]   the fact that you want happiness,
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.220]   that there's something so real inside of all of us
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.380]   was given to you by God.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.220]   Like he didn't give that to you
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.620]   as like some sort of a sick joke.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.180]   If man, I'm gonna give you these desires
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.220]   and you guys figure out how to handle them.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.620]   No, he gave them to you on purpose.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.260]   He gave them to you on purpose
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.740]   because what he wants is for you to pursue them to the end
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.440]   with something that will truly satisfy,
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.980]   which is him and him alone.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.500]   The desires that God gave you are not bad.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.980]   In fact, they are God given.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.380]   And then what he wants for you is to pursue them
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.000]   and to drive you to what ultimately will satisfy you.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.660]   There's a author that I love a lot.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.820]   His name is C.S. Lewis
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.380]   and he has one of my favorite quotes ever.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.180]   One of my favorite quotes ever on this topic.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.140]   And I think it's so insightful.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.340]   He's a man that loved the Lord
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.220]   and he really understood humanity and our brokenness.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.200]   And he says this,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.060]   it would seem that our Lord finds our desires
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:00.820]   not too strong, but too weak.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.660]   I'm gonna say that again.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.580]   It would seem that our Lord finds our desires
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.780]   not too strong, but too weak.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.380]   I don't know if you're like me at all.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.060]   I remember before I was a believer,
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.420]   I just thought like, man, there's just something,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.740]   I just crave more than other people.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.120]   Like this whole like Jesus thing is great,
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.940]   but like I just need more.
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.980]   And what C.S. Lewis is saying, no, no, no,
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.340]   you don't need more, you are settling for less.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.660]   He defines our desires not too strong, but too weak.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.780]   He says, we are half-hearted creatures.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.900]   Fooling about with drink and sex and ambition
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.220]   when infinite joy is offered us.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:44.940]   We are half-hearted creatures,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.620]   like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.620]   in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.080]   by the offer of a holiday at the sea.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.400]   We are far too easily pleased.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.960]   He's saying, don't settle friends.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.080]   That desire God gave you is a good one, cultivate it,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.960]   grow it, let it drive you to the thing
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:12.600]   that ultimately satisfies.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.880]   And so the answer on how to overcome laziness
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.240]   and gluttony and self-indulgence in our lives
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.680]   is not simply just to grit it out,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.240]   not simply, he's not God's like, hey, just like be strong,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.680]   pull up your bootstraps, you're gonna make it,
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.560]   it's gonna be all right.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.640]   No, in fact, it is to pursue wholeheartedly
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.080]   what alone will satisfy you.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.920]   And Jesus says it, he says, hunger and thirst
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.120]   for righteousness, because if you do, you'll be satisfied.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.200]   Desire and pursue righteousness.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.740]   And what's really cool, what I love about his language there
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.600]   is that just the terms hunger and thirst
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.040]   implies that it's very natural,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.440]   implies that our cravings and the fact
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.520]   that we want something more,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.920]   the fact that we want fulfillment
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.940]   is something God gave us, it's a natural thing.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.980]   And also what he means when he says righteousness here
[00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.600]   is he just means a personal faithfulness and loyalty to God.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.560]   He says, pursue personal faithfulness and loyalty to God,
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.100]   pursue God and you will be satisfied.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.560]   And so the path to long-term victory over sin
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.520]   is to gain a superior satisfaction in God.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.760]   The path to long-term victory over sin
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   is to gain a superior satisfaction in God.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.240]   And so I just wanna give us some practical steps this evening
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.080]   on what to do.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.920]   How do I grow a hunger and thirst for righteousness
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.800]   or a superior satisfaction in God
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.100]   and the first one is this,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:35.700]   you need to believe that God alone can satisfy.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.980]   Like we're never going to move the needle,
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.420]   we are never going to be able to quit our desires
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:48.340]   or our self-indulging hearts and ways
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:52.620]   if we do not believe that God alone can satisfy.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:53.460]   Here's what I want you to know,
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.020]   I just wanna be so real with you.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.580]   That belief, if you get there,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.600]   that belief is going to be constantly challenged.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.960]   There is never going to be a day that you wake up
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.960]   where that belief isn't challenged
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.200]   because there are going to be things that are in your face
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.120]   that like you know will bring you satisfaction like this.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:12.520]   That belief is going to be constantly challenged
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.720]   and so you need the truth of God's word,
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.480]   you need to know what God's word has to say
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.420]   and then you need his people around you to remind you
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.640]   that God alone can satisfy you.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.840]   So the first way to grow a hunger and thirst for righteousness
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.740]   is to believe that God alone can satisfy.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.040]   And the second way is this, is to discipline yourself.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.240]   Discipline yourself to grow a taste for righteousness
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.420]   and a distaste for self-indulgence.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.700]   And I've just simply,
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.260]   there's lots of ways you could explain discipline.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.140]   I just said it this way,
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:47.140]   discipline is consistently making the choice
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.220]   to do what is best.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.060]   Not just what you want in the moment,
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.300]   but discipline is consistently making the choice
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.180]   to do what is best.
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:01.180]   It is a daily moment by moment choice.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.900]   Friends, be aware of your choices.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.660]   If you really want to desire and pursue something
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.760]   that's going to satisfy you,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.160]   you need to be aware of your choices.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.660]   You need to discipline yourself in your choices.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.460]   I've had someone explain it to me like this
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.020]   and this is really helpful.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.580]   Said discipline begets desire.
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.340]   Meaning it starts with just like,
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.800]   getting out of, I'm doing this thing
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.980]   because I know it's good for me.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.540]   And that moves to this place of like, man, I like desire.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.700]   Like I want to do this.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.780]   And then desire moves to a place of delight
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.260]   where you're going, I find life here.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.900]   Not moving away from just like, man, I'm doing this
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:37.820]   'cause I know it's good for me.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.980]   It's like, I think I'm starting to enjoy this.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.020]   Like this is what life is about.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.220]   Discipline begets desire.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.740]   Desire begets light.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.140]   And here's the thing, and we all know this.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.100]   And I just want to be so honest with all of you
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.640]   is that discipline does not feel good in the moment.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.400]   It doesn't.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.640]   Like discipline never feels good in the moment.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.800]   If you're like me, I'll put it this way.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.640]   I like to work out.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   It's a thing that I do really into CrossFit,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.740]   you know, boo, yay, whatever.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.480]   Heart of my joints, whatever.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.680]   Every single workout for me starts like this.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.140]   I don't want to.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:14.980]   I mean, I'm serious.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.800]   Like every single workout starts like that.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.320]   Like I just like don't want to.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.960]   And every single one of it ends like this.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.500]   I'm so glad I did.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:29.140]   And friends, discipline isn't going to feel good.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.140]   And Jesus also is incredibly honest about this.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.380]   He speaks directly into it.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.260]   Luke chapter 9, 23 to 25, Jesus says this.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.980]   "If anyone would come after me,
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.100]   "let him deny himself and take up his cross daily
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.260]   "and follow me.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.440]   "For whoever would save his life will lose it,
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.640]   "but whoever loses his life for my sake
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.620]   "will save it.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.040]   "For what does it profit a man
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.440]   "if he would gain the whole world
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.300]   "and loses or forfeits himself?"
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.420]   He's really honest.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.620]   He says, "Following me equals denying yourself."
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.200]   But the promise he makes is wild.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.880]   He says, "If you deny yourself in this life for his sake,
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.300]   "you will save your life for eternity."
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.540]   And I want you to know, friends,
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:16.140]   we, you and I, in and of ourselves,
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.940]   are unable to deny ourselves.
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.820]   Like it's impossible.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.820]   But what's amazing is that when we trust in Christ
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.500]   and what he has done on a cross for us,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.460]   that he actually gives us the strength and the power
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.020]   to like, to turn away from the things that we want,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.580]   to turn away from the immediate gratification
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.820]   and satisfaction and to pursue wholeheartedly
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.740]   what's going to satisfy us.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.460]   And so just to finish the point,
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.560]   like the path, the path to change,
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   self-indulgence is in believing a different promise.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.120]   For happiness.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.920]   It's believing a different promise,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.880]   believing the one person and one thing
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.320]   that can come good on that promise.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.140]   And it's Jesus.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.140]   And he says, "Hunger and thirst for righteousness."
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.640]   And here's what I want to close this evening.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.720]   I just want to welcome you into my life
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.180]   and what this journey of self-indulgence,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.460]   of sin has looked like for me.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.880]   And so at 17, when people are graduating high school,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.060]   I was leaving home.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.720]   I was leaving home to pursue a career in riding bulls.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.460]   I know that's really crazy.
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.080]   And, but I was doing that because I had found out
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.360]   that I was like, I had, there was a guy,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.480]   friend of mine that said,
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.880]   "Hey, there's some guy who rides a buck in bulls.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.220]   "You can go get on.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.820]   "You can go pay $30 and get on."
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.940]   And I was like, "Man, I'm gonna try that out."
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.100]   And then as it turns out, I was good at it.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.520]   And like, I was really good at it.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.080]   So at 17, I left home to go pursue this dream.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.580]   And here's what it did for me.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:59.880]   I lived exactly how I wanted to every single day.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.160]   I was making a lot of money.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.080]   I was free to live.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.160]   And I didn't have a coach.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.320]   I wasn't tied to anything.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.000]   I literally lived out of a minivan.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.560]   I rode bulls in almost every single state.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.600]   It allowed me experiences.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.580]   I crave and desire and long for experiences.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.820]   I got that in spades.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.160]   Wherever I wanted to go, I could go.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.860]   I was free.
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:25.860]   Relationships with women in different cities
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.360]   every single weekend.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.960]   Fame, people knew my name.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.500]   Like I did it.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.340]   Like I got it.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.260]   Like everything that I was pursuing,
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.620]   all those cravings that I wanted,
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.060]   God in his kindness allowed me to find that.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.800]   And here's what I found.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:51.480]   It was incredibly and devastatingly empty.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.540]   In the middle of like when I was at my peak,
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.440]   when I was like everything is going well,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.120]   I couldn't be any better.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.600]   Like more people know my name.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.880]   I have more money than I ever have.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.680]   I'm dating someone who's beautiful.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.260]   I had never felt so empty.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.980]   Because the truth is, friends,
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.800]   you and I were never meant to be God in our lives.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.680]   God is meant to be God.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.840]   And if you don't know him,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.640]   and if you don't know what it's like to be fully satisfied,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.560]   I can tell you now on the other side of this,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.800]   on the other side of pursuing all of my fleshly desires
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.980]   and finding it and making it,
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.220]   that the only time that I've truly felt satisfied
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.560]   is when I sit in a relationship
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.960]   with the one who created me and made me.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.620]   And I want that same thing for you.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:52.880]   But man, there's a hidden little thing in our hearts
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.480]   that hides itself that we're gonna justify.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.200]   It's a sin of self-indulgence,
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.280]   and it will rob you
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.960]   if you just hold on to the satisfaction it brings.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.480]   And instead of running to the true satisfaction
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.040]   that's only found in Jesus.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:06.880]   We pray for us.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.480]   Father, I confess in my own life
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.780]   that even though I know these truths,
[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.680]   that even though I know and understand and believe
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.440]   that you alone can satisfy,
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.640]   that I turn to myself,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.880]   that I frankly want to be God of my own life.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.120]   And I pray for every single one of my friends
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:38.900]   that they would understand that there is more to be found
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.420]   there's more life, life to the full you say found in you.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.880]   So would you give us the strength?
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.200]   Would you give us the courage?
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.920]   Would you give us the ability to deny ourselves,
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.520]   to let go of the things that we think
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.380]   are going to satisfy us and hold on to you,
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.800]   the only one who will satisfy.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:03.160]   Father, forgive me, forgive us
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.440]   for the ways we turn from you.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.140]   And we look to satisfy ourselves with our own desires.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.840]   And may you grow in our hearts,
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.340]   a superior satisfaction in you and you alone.
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.180]   Thank you for this evening.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.000]   Thank you for your word.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.560]   Thank you for the fact that I can run to your word
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   and be reminded of your truth.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.120]   And father, I just ask if there's anyone out there
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.760]   that doesn't yet know you.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.200]   If there's anyone out there that is still sitting
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.960]   in the desires of thinking
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.600]   that they're going to find satisfaction
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.520]   and just the emptiness,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.560]   they're sitting there empty alone, wondering what happened,
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.000]   wondering how they got to this feeling of emptiness,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.220]   this feeling of loneliness,
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.840]   because they pursued all the things they wanted to.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.560]   Father, would you just step into their life tonight
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   and show them that you love them,
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.240]   that they need you,
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.140]   and that life to its full is found in you.
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.080]   We love you a lot, so we pray, amen.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
