00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [MUSIC]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 >> Ports, how we doing?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,200
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,920
 >> Love it, love it.

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,920
 So in my transition and kind of, right, I think this was,

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,800
 trying to time stamp this, I think this was just before I became a Christian.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,520
 Probably around 12, 13, 13 years ago.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,600
 A friend in Dallas, so I was not a Christian as a young adult in Dallas.

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,280
 I'm kind of living in the bars and the clubs of Lower Greenville at the time and

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
 the uptown scene, and that's a part of my story.

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,200
 And so this friend invites me to this really exclusive kind of

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,040
 gathering club thing on Knox Henderson there.

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,400
 And so I didn't know, and they're like, hey, you gotta be on the list.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,920
 Your name needs to be on the list, let's go.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,400
 And I'm like, okay, yeah, well, let's go check that out.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,440
 And so we're driving, and I'm kind of looking at the clubs that have all the

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,360
 lights and the stuff, come here, this would be fun, that kind of.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,440
 And then we pull up to this, we valet, and then there's just a door.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's really unmarked, and there's a line in front of the door, and

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
 there's a big bouncer there.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,480
 And so we get in that line, like this is the place, like really, it's this?

23
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,680
 And my friend, we were separate, by the way, and so they had told me,

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,840
 they had assured me that they had put my name on the list,

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,160
 your name has to be on the list.

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,920
 And so I'm kind of watching this line whittle down as I walk up there, and

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
 these insecurities start to set in, right?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
 And because this guy, he's up there, and I mean, huge guy, bigger than me.

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,960
 I mean, looks like he ate a, well, he looks like Luke, actually,

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,440
 the guy that did announcements.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,000
 And so he's up there, and he's just kind of checking this list.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,560
 And there's this guy, a couple people in front of me, and he gets up there, and

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,840
 this bouncer looks at the list, and the dude tells his name,

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,160
 looks at the list again, flips the page, shakes his head.

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,880
 And dude does the walk of shame back to his car.

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,400
 And then I'm like, what if I gotta do the walk of shame?

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,360
 Like, what if they didn't put my name down on this list?

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,440
 I'm gonna get up there, like how embarrassing is that gonna be that I

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,640
 think I'm gonna go into this place, my friend told me it was gonna be this

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,040
 amazing thing at the time, what mattered to me, open bar, lots of free food,

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,800
 you know, great time, I'm excited about it, I'm in this line, I think I'm gonna go in.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
 And then I'm thinking, all these insecurities hit, and

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
 I'm like, what if my name's not on the list?

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,320
 And I think for a lot of us, right, like in fact, if we can,

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,000
 just before we go further, let's just do this.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,160
 I want the weight of tonight to hit us early,

47
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,600
 honestly, like where we're headed in this sermon on the mount.

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,480
 So would you close your eyes, and I just want you to envision something.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:15,720
 So let's say you die, and you're standing in heaven, bright light.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,840
 And you see in the distance Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,920
 And you're moving toward him, and it hits you the reality that everything

52
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,600
 that you had heard about Christianity is true.

53
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,200
 And you're just like, this is crazy, it's real, I'm in heaven.

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,960
 And then you begin to get excited because you've heard about heaven.

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,160
 And you're thinking, this is gonna be incredible.

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,000
 Like for the rest of eternity, I get to be with God, and you move closer to Jesus.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,720
 And he says this, and I'm just gonna read to you the words tonight.

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,080
 You get closer to Jesus, there you are face to face with him, and he says,

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,080
 not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,280
 But only the one who did the will of my Father who lives here.

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,040
 And you might say, Lord, Lord, did I not serve in your name and

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,480
 do good to others in your name and share with others?

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,760
 I went to church, I attended the porch, I read my Bible.

64
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
 And then he tells you plainly,

65
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,160
 I never knew you away from me, you evildoer.

66
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,080
 You can come back with me.

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,560
 Those are the closing words tonight.

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,880
 In this message, as Jesus moves through the Sermon on the Mount,

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,640
 he's coming to the end of his sermon, and he ends with a bang.

70
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,560
 He wants you to feel this in Matthew chapter 7.

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,840
 Because the reality of it is, friends, there are only two religions.

72
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,480
 In the entire world, there really are only two religions.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,200
 I know that flies in the face of maybe what you came in here thinking.

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,920
 But the reality of it is there is the religion of those who have trusted in

75
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,880
 Christ, God's provision through his son Jesus, his death and

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,680
 resurrection for the forgiveness of their sins, and then there is everything else.

77
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,440
 There is the worship of the evil one, Satan, and

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,200
 then there's the inadvertent worship of the evil one, Satan,

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,920
 through any other religion out there.

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,000
 Anything that you think will get you to paradise outside of trusting in God's

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,960
 provision and God's provision alone in Jesus Christ.

82
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,560
 Now, I understand that to some of you that is unbelievably offensive.

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,640
 And would you just hang out with me for 30 minutes?

84
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,720
 Let's teach this text.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
 And if at the end of it we still disagree, I'd love a conversation with you.

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,800
 I'll stay as late as I need to, to have a conversation with you.

87
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
 And so excited about where we are.

88
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,320
 It's truth.

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,880
 It's God's sovereign truth.

90
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,240
 I saw one of you tweeted that earlier, and I love that.

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,280
 And so tonight we're talking about the two paths to heaven.

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,680
 And I think so many of us, we view Jesus like that bouncer that has this list, and

93
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
 he's letting some in and keeping others out.

94
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,760
 And I wanna see what part of that vision in our minds is true and

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,240
 what part of that vision in our minds is absolutely inconsistent with the word of

96
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,400
 God before we leave here this evening.

97
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,600
 And so we're in this series called Summer on the Mount,

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,480
 where on June 10th is where we started, and we started talking about the Beatitudes.

99
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,160
 The next message, we covered the fulfillment of the law in Jesus Christ.

100
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,200
 And then we talked about dealing with anger, as Jesus taught it.

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,720
 And then Jesus taught us about lust and adultery.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,960
 As we move further in the Sermon on the Mount, we talked about commitment.

103
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
 Then we talked about love for our enemies.

104
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,320
 Then we talked about fake Christianity.

105
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,680
 Then we talked about an eternal perspective.

106
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,880
 And then we talked about what judge not lest you be judged really means.

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,760
 And then last week, we talked about praying to a good father who loves us and

108
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,840
 desires to give us good.

109
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
 We'll have one more week after tonight, and we'll go to launch.

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,520
 And then we'll come back and start a new series.

111
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,560
 And so excited about what God has for us ahead.

112
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,000
 Tonight, we're gonna cover two paths.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,560
 Everyone is on one of two paths.

114
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,440
 Two types of prophets.

115
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,800
 One leads people astray.

116
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,920
 And two types of people.

117
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,440
 Those who will be with God forever, and those who won't.

118
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
 See, there's two types of people.

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,280
 There's those whose name is on that list right now, and

120
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,680
 there's those whose name is not on that list right now.

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,560
 So let's dive in.

122
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,360
 Matthew chapter 7, we'll start in verse 13.

123
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,160
 Jesus says this.

124
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,120
 Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and

125
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,440
 broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.

126
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,120
 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and

127
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,160
 only a few find it.

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,560
 Jesus commands you to enter.

129
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,440
 And he says, everyone will enter one of the gate.

130
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,400
 He says, most people will enter this gate, the wide gate.

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,880
 The one that is attractive to the world.

132
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,840
 Everyone come in this gate, but there's a sub gate.

133
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:27,920
 Much smaller, difficult to find, he says.

134
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,600
 And he says specifically, Jesus Christ, Lord on the earth,

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,760
 goes out of his way to say, only a few will enter here.

136
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,880
 And so he says, he exhorts you, porch, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,

137
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,080
 wherever you are, enter through that gate, please.

138
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,440
 My first point this evening is there are two paths, but only one leads to paradise.

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,160
 But I want you to know they both present paradise.

140
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,040
 No one says, hey, come here, go to hell.

141
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,880
 It's gonna be awesome.

142
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,400
 Weeping and gnashing of teeth, come in, come once.

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,920
 They both present paradise.

144
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,080
 Every false gospel out there, every false ideology out there

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,760
 is presenting to you some kind of good.

146
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,720
 It is a bait and switch.

147
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,400
 It says, hey, come in here and find life.

148
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
 This is where life is.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,040
 And so many here tonight and so many listening have bought the lie

150
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,000
 that life is in the wrong place when Jesus Christ says, no, life's in here.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,160
 Make sure you enter this door, this narrow gate.

152
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,200
 He says the other one, that's the road that the majority travels.

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,760
 That's heavy for us tonight, right?

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,800
 I mean, family goes down the road of the majority, the friends, close loved ones.

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
 That's really heavy.

156
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,400
 Many, he says most, most people, you might hear sometimes people say,

157
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,720
 well, I think most people go to heaven.

158
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
 Well, that's just not what Jesus said.

159
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,120
 Jesus said few.

160
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
 He says most people don't go to heaven.

161
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,720
 Most people go to hell.

162
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,880
 That's what he's saying right here.

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,920
 That's the road that many travel.

164
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,600
 He says, few find the small gate.

165
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,240
 It's not the normal path.

166
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,920
 And so here's what I would tell you here.

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,000
 If you spend your money like everyone else does, if you date like everyone else does,

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
 if you go the way of the crowds, you might want to make sure you enter

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
 through the right gate.

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,640
 But he says the people that enter through this gate, it's the marginal, the minority,

171
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:52,880
 the few, the weird ones, the odd ones, maybe the outcast, maybe the downtrodden.

172
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,400
 Few have found the truth.

173
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 Just consider that for a minute, like the few have found the truth.

174
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,480
 How many people, if you just left here, and let's say you went somewhere,

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,240
 let's say you went to the mall, and you started going up to people and you say,

176
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,440
 "Hey, how do you get to heaven?"

177
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,120
 How many people would you talk to until someone said, "Well, you trust in God's

178
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,640
 provision through Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection."

179
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,200
 That's the only way.

180
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
 I mean, you may hear, you know, "Hey, there's not a heaven."

181
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,240
 You may hear, "Well, you do good works.

182
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,600
 You try to have your good works outweigh the bad.

183
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
 You try to be a good person."

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,160
 I don't know, believe in God.

185
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,040
 I don't know, know God.

186
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,440
 I don't know, read the Bible, go to church.

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,040
 You might hear those answers, but how many people would you have to talk...

188
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,920
 All of those are false gospels.

189
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 They're all not true.

190
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,960
 They're all lies, and they lead you straight into this door.

191
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,320
 And then there's one, "Trust in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection for the

192
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,080
 forgiveness of sins."

193
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:57,040
 Do you see how wide the road is that outside of trust in Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection

194
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
 for the forgiveness of sins?

195
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,120
 For he says in John chapter 10, verse 9 and 10, "I am the gate.

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,240
 Whoever enters through me will be saved.

197
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,820
 They will come in and go out and find pasture.

198
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,540
 The thief, that's Satan, comes only to steal, kill, and destroy.

199
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,820
 I have come that they may have life and have it to the full."

200
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,000
 So many of you think Jesus wants to rip you off.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,760
 Jesus wants to set you free.

202
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,400
 Jesus wants to give you life so for the first time you can have life.

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,680
 I have partied hard, man.

204
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
 I have lived, I have searched the world.

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,960
 I have pursued money, drugs, sex, so many things where I thought life was only to come

206
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,360
 to a place where I found life in Jesus Christ.

207
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,440
 And I thought if you found life in Jesus Christ that you were delusional.

208
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,760
 And so some of you here tonight, I imagine, think that those that say, "Hey, we want to

209
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,080
 live radically for Christ," are delusional, we're not.

210
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,680
 We've just found something for true that's true.

211
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,840
 We've just found truth.

212
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,680
 I remember really in my transition when I had trusted in Christ and I had stopped hitting

213
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,160
 the bar scene and the club scene and there was this grand opening of this bar on Lower

214
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 Greenville.

215
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
 It was called the Sugar Shack.

216
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,400
 Anybody hear this?

217
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,920
 Lower Greenville, if you're listening, is just kind of the club scene or was especially,

218
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,560
 more so even in my day.

219
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,480
 And that makes me feel old, in my day, back in my day.

220
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,160
 And so it was the grand opening of this place called the Sugar Shack.

221
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,960
 I think it's called, it's like the Bulzerk.

222
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,480
 It's right by the Old Crow, if you're familiar with that area.

223
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,080
 I know all of you are like, "Lower Greenville, where is that?"

224
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,000
 But anyways, and so the Sugar Shack was the grand opening.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
 And it was kind of the same deal.

226
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,380
 Like there was a big buzz about it and everybody wanted to go.

227
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,160
 And so there was this long line and you'd wait in the long line of people and then you'd

228
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,760
 eventually make your way into the grand opening and then you'd fight your way to the bar because

229
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
 it was so crowded.

230
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
 And the DJ was in there.

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,380
 They brought in this DJ and everybody was jumping around and bouncing, just dancing

232
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,200
 and having a great time.

233
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,440
 And then lo and behold, the floor fell out on the grand opening.

234
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,720
 The wooden floor, which sat lots of feet above the concrete floor, which was 20 years old,

235
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,520
 fell and the entire club crashed through the floor.

236
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,160
 And I remember, in fact, here's a quote from someone that just says, "Everyone was having

237
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,640
 fun and suddenly the floor opens up and everyone starts screaming and people are being carried

238
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,600
 out on stretchers."

239
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,080
 You see that wide road?

240
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,920
 It has a trap door, man.

241
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,580
 Like that's what I think we're dancing off a cliff, man.

242
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,600
 I think we are living in this world in the pursuit of every indulgence and pleasure and

243
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,040
 comfort that we can find, keeping God out of it, keeping some sort of idea of like,

244
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
 "Yeah, I know God.

245
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
 Now let me get all the pleasure I can."

246
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,080
 And you don't know God.

247
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,480
 You don't have a real relationship with the creator.

248
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,300
 And I'm trying to tell you, Jesus is trying to tell you, that's the wide road.

249
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,700
 That's the wide road.

250
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,540
 And the wide path has a trap door.

251
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,800
 And we're dancing off that cliff.

252
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,960
 We are partying off that cliff and you don't win.

253
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,880
 And it does not go well in the end.

254
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,380
 And God is begging you, pleading with you to something else.

255
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,780
 And you say, "Well, how do you know He is?"

256
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,220
 Because you're here right now on a Tuesday night.

257
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,300
 You hear this message.

258
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,460
 You're going to leave here and return back to your wicked ways, back to your life, your

259
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,740
 pursuit of money, back to your pursuit of sex, back to your pursuit of pleasures.

260
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,900
 No, the Lord loves you so much.

261
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:54,280
 On a Tuesday night, He has you hearing this.

262
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,920
 This path is enticing, right?

263
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,560
 I mean, everyone, they want this path.

264
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,680
 It looks like the right path.

265
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,720
 And everyone on this path thinks they've chosen correctly.

266
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,960
 Like the people that have gone through this door, they think they have chosen the right

267
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,640
 gate.

268
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,560
 And they've been deceived.

269
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,240
 And they've been deceived by people, even people with Bibles, using truth to manipulate.

270
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,920
 Let's go back, verse 15.

271
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,920
 Watch out for false prophets.

272
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,760
 They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

273
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,080
 By their fruit you will recognize them.

274
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,000
 Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,960
 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

276
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,680
 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

277
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,200
 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

278
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,720
 Thus by their fruit you will recognize them.

279
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,500
 Let me just, let me, it's heavy, I know.

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,080
 So let me back up and just remind you.

281
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,840
 Jesus is using prime real estate in the greatest sermon ever told, and He's wrapping it up.

282
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,400
 And before He finishes, He says, "Hey, I've got to tell you something."

283
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,920
 Like you've got to hear this, man.

284
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,840
 Like this is important.

285
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,840
 And so my second point this evening is there are two types of prophets, and many of those

286
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,640
 prophets are posers.

287
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
 Many of them are posers.

288
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 They're fakes.

289
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 They're frauds.

290
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,640
 They are not true, and you've got to learn to discern which ones are true of God, teachers,

291
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,080
 disciple-makers, teachers, and which ones are posers, because they both appear to be

292
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,800
 good.

293
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,560
 And He says, "How do you tell the difference between a real prophet and a false prophet?"

294
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
 He says, "By their fruit."

295
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,760
 He goes off on this gardening illustration, and He just says, "Hey, what does that mean?"

296
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
 Here's how I would translate that.

297
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,020
 By their product, by what they produce.

298
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,060
 So think about this.

299
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,000
 You know a teacher by a student.

300
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,320
 You know a disciple-maker by the disciples that they produce, because whatever they love,

301
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
 their people are going to love.

302
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 Their followers.

303
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
 Disciple is just a word for follower.

304
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
 Christian is just a word for follower of Jesus, follower of Christ.

305
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,400
 He says, "You will know them by their fruit."

306
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,800
 And so in context, He's talking about the Pharisees that are there.

307
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,760
 So He's teaching this sermon outside.

308
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,120
 His disciples are close, and then the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the teachers of the

309
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 law are there.

310
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,120
 Jesus had this ministry to them, opposing them.

311
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,040
 These were the religious people, and He expounds on that.

312
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,120
 There's a commentary on this in Matthew chapter 23.

313
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,440
 You could read the whole chapter.

314
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,640
 There's several woes to the Pharisees, but in verse 15, He just says this, "Woe to you,

315
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,640
 teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites."

316
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 What is a hypocrite?

317
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,400
 It's somebody that appears to be one thing, but is really something else.

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,800
 You hypocrites.

319
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,680
 You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you

320
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,040
 make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.

321
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,360
 You already said, "Hey, woe to you religious people.

322
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,360
 You go on mission trips to Africa and to Hades and all over the world, and when you get there,

323
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
 you don't make them know God.

324
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,920
 You make them worship you.

325
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,040
 You do it so that they would think highly of you, more of you.

326
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,040
 You're making followers of you, not followers of me."

327
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,720
 Then He says this in verse 33, "You snakes, you brood of vipers, how will you escape being

328
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,720
 condemned to hell?

329
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,320
 Therefore I am sending you prophets and sages and teachers."

330
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
 See, also Paul, Peter, John.

331
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,400
 "Some of them you will kill and crucify.

332
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,880
 Others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town."

333
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,040
 What an incredible prophecy Jesus says here.

334
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,600
 He says, "I'm going to send to you my disciples, and you're going to kill them."

335
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,720
 That did not come true.

336
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,040
 They crucified Peter upside down, beheaded Paul, boiled John alive, threw James, his

337
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,800
 brother from the top of the temple, and then beat him with clubs because they wouldn't

338
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,080
 deny the resurrected Jesus.

339
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,120
 Why wouldn't they deny the resurrected Jesus?

340
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
 Because they knew it was true.

341
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
 They had seen it with their own eyes.

342
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,080
 So who are the false prophets today?

343
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,240
 I tell you, prosperity teachers you see on TV are the first ones that come to mind.

344
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,200
 First Timothy chapter 6, he gives a whole section to this.

345
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,640
 He says, "These are false teachers."

346
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:40,400
 Anyone who tells you that godliness is a means to financial gain, that's a liar and a false

347
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,960
 teacher.

348
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,360
 If anyone says, "Hey, give me your money, and I'll give you, and God's going to give

349
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:52,680
 you more money," they are a liar or a blackjack dealer or something.

350
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,680
 It says this in First Timothy 6, "If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the

351
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,240
 sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ, other than the gospel, and to godly teaching,

352
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,400
 they are conceited and understand nothing.

353
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,000
 They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy,

354
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,680
 strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions, and constant friction between people of corrupt

355
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:22,000
 mind who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial

356
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,760
 gain."

357
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,280
 What is the fruit of their teaching?

358
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,000
 Godliness equals financial gain.

359
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,520
 Some of you have bought into some false teaching.

360
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,000
 Some of you here tonight.

361
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I think so many of us, we pursue God, hoping just in return to get a better us.

362
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,160
 That's not what God is offering you.

363
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,400
 He's not offering you your best life.

364
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,520
 He's offering you His best life.

365
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,840
 He's not offering you a better you.

366
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,360
 He's offering you Him forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.

367
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,760
 My friend calls that therapeutic moralistic deism.

368
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
 He says that's the number one religion today.

369
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:22,200
 That is that you believe in God, therefore you do good to feel better.

370
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,120
 The center of your theology is you.

371
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,320
 It's self-centeredness.

372
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,360
 It is the greatest opposition to the church today.

373
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,720
 Narcissism.

374
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
 Self-centeredness.

375
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,520
 It's why depression levels are at an all-time high.

376
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,960
 Because we think about us too much.

377
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,980
 God says, "Will you stop thinking about you altogether and start to thinking about me

378
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,760
 and loving others?"

379
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
 Loving God and loving others.

380
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,000
 It's His will for your life.

381
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,840
 His purpose for your life.

382
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,640
 Anyone who teaches a false doctrine is a false teacher.

383
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
 What does that mean?

384
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
 That includes, so Jesus is who He's talking about here outside in our context, outside

385
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
 the context of the Pharisees.

386
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
 He's talking about world religions.

387
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,960
 Outside of Christianity, He's talking about cults that include works plus Jesus or Jesus

388
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
 plus works.

389
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,520
 Any ideology, let me break it down for you like this.

390
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,320
 Any ideology that says you are saved by anything other than Christ's works alone is false

391
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 teaching.

392
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,480
 Doesn't that make it so simple for you?

393
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,800
 If they're teaching anything other than salvation by grace through faith alone, faith in Jesus

394
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,520
 Christ, His works alone, it is false teaching.

395
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,160
 It is not true teaching.

396
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,560
 You're being deceived and you're just there saying, "Hey, come in."

397
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,200
 They may not even know it, but they're saying, "Hey, come in.

398
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,000
 Enter the wide road."

399
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,840
 It's paradise, man.

400
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
 Paradise is in here.

401
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
 Come on.

402
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
 Come one and for all.

403
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
 Enter this gate.

404
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,920
 Meanwhile, Jesus said, "No, I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no one gets to

405
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,800
 the Father except through me."

406
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,400
 John 14, 6.

407
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
 This is the way.

408
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,320
 For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.

409
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
 This is not of yourselves.

410
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,640
 This is the gift of God, not by works so that no one can boast.

411
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,480
 Ephesians 2, 8, 9.

412
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,920
 Wide is the road, but narrow is the gate.

413
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,560
 Some of you are like, "But they're really good people.

414
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
 Like Gandhi was a good person."

415
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:32,760
 If he did not know Jesus, he's not with Jesus.

416
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,680
 The Dalai Lama, a good person.

417
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,960
 The problem with that is God says, "No one's good, not even one.

418
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,800
 And I promise you, nobody is good enough to get into heaven."

419
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:51,000
 Oprah, if she has not trusted in Christ, she will not be in his kingdom.

420
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,680
 He has the guest list, and he's invited all his friends.

421
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,120
 False teachers.

422
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,760
 We went to, I say we, we do this deal called Unashamed.

423
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,120
 I know a lot of you are familiar with it.

424
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
 It's where we go, we call it a mission trip in Dallas, and we go to Dallas, and we share

425
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,520
 Christ in the city of Dallas, in uptown, and lower Greenville, and West Dallas, and kind

426
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:25,920
 of our hometown, and Exotica, the pornography convention was here last week, a couple weeks

427
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 ago.

428
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,720
 And so they had an Unashamed that weekend, and so Ryan and Allie and their friends went

429
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,160
 down there, and they just stood outside of Exotica and shared the love of Christ with

430
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,760
 those that are there, those that are looking for hope and the pleasures of sex and the

431
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,360
 sex industry.

432
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,840
 Sadly, there were some other people who called themselves Christians there.

433
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,400
 They were sat there at the gate, and as people came out, they said, "You deserve to be raped."

434
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,000
 They said, "You deserve AIDS in the name of Jesus.

435
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,560
 That's false teaching."

436
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,360
 He says, "You will know them by their fruit."

437
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
 Who are those people?

438
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,200
 They're the disciples of false teachers.

439
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,760
 That's the fruit of false teaching are those people.

440
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,600
 They bought some other gospel.

441
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,120
 But how can I say that?

442
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,080
 Because what is the fruit of God's spirit that indwells us?

443
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,920
 Galatians 5 tells us it's love, joy, peace, forbearance or patience, kindness, goodness,

444
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,720
 gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.

445
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,000
 Where in that is, "Hey, you deserve to be raped."

446
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Where is that in the fruit of the spirit, friends?

447
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,120
 False teachers.

448
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,800
 Know them by their fruits.

449
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,280
 False teachers.

450
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
 False teaching.

451
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 How do you know a good teacher by their student?

452
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,920
 The other day, my little girl, Finley, she's six years old, and we're driving down the

453
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,840
 road coming back from family camp, and we're listening to the radio.

454
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,280
 She just says, "Daddy, who do you think is trusted in Jesus more, Taylor Swift or Katy

455
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
 Perry?"

456
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,760
 I said, "I don't know, babe.

457
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:10,000
 They both got bad blood."

458
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,880
 I said, "I don't know, Finley, but here's what I know about T. Swift and Katy Perry.

459
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
 They're both false teachers.

460
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,640
 Baby girl, that's what you need to know.

461
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,280
 When you want to reflect on last Friday night or when you're feeling 22, you need to know

462
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,600
 that's a false gospel.

463
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:38,120
 When you're trying to fill a blank space with anything else, I'm not even trying to be funny

464
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
 or culturally relevant.

465
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,520
 Maybe I am.

466
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,920
 I'm just saying, hey, that's a false gospel.

467
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,600
 That is false teaching.

468
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,360
 It affects your cultural worldview, too.

469
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,920
 Some of us, that would be it.

470
00:27:51,920 --> 00:28:00,360
 If we could just be like them, if you could just be like a false teacher, what do you

471
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,760
 think Jesus is saying here in Matthew chapter 7?

472
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,000
 He's called us out of the world to be different from the world.

473
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,680
 I think some of us are in goal as the world.

474
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:21,600
 He's called us out of the world that we would stand in contrast to the world not to set

475
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,400
 our goal on worldliness, that we would be like the world.

476
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
 What are you saying?

477
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,240
 That I need to be a radical Christian?

478
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,440
 I don't even know that there's such thing as a radical Christian.

479
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,320
 I think they're just run-of-the-mill normal Christians.

480
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,200
 People who give their money away to the poor, care for widows and orphans.

481
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,460
 People who share the gospel everywhere they go.

482
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,600
 People who feast on the word of God.

483
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:52,600
 People who sell out for the pleasures of the world for completely and full devotion to

484
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
 God.

485
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,040
 That's not radical Christianity.

486
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,680
 It's just Christianity.

487
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,240
 It's just living like you believe in Jesus.

488
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,920
 Said otherwise, it's just believing in Jesus.

489
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:17,520
 You grew up in a culture where if you claim the label as Christian, you are one.

490
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,080
 That's what so many people I meet with believe.

491
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
 I say, "Are you a Christian?"

492
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
 They say, "Yes."

493
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 I present the gospel.

494
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,360
 They say, "I don't know if I believe that."

495
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,480
 What makes you a Christian?

496
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,920
 You can't just say, "I'm a Christian," and become one.

497
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,320
 That's like me saying I'm a doctor.

498
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,200
 Where did you go to residency?

499
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,680
 I didn't do residency.

500
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
 Where did you get your PhD?

501
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,880
 I don't have a PhD.

502
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
 How are you a doctor?

503
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,800
 "Oh, my dad's a doctor.

504
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,840
 His dad was a doctor, so I'm a doctor."

505
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,160
 How did you become a doctor?

506
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:54,240
 "Oh, you know, I go to the doctor a lot, so I'm a doctor."

507
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,200
 You can't just say you're a doctor and be one.

508
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,980
 You can't just say you're a Christian and be one.

509
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,360
 That doesn't make you a Christian.

510
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,680
 What makes you a Christian?

511
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,340
 You follow Christ.

512
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,600
 First and foremost, you trust in his provision of forgiveness for you through his act, not

513
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,780
 yours.

514
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,800
 That in the greatest event in the history of the world, also the worst event in the

515
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,520
 history of the world, became the greatest event in the history of the world.

516
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,480
 Christ died on a cross.

517
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,200
 God in the flesh on a cross.

518
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,240
 How did we miss it?

519
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,040
 That's so pivotal to Christianity that we would live every single day in light of that

520
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:36,480
 truth that Christ died for us, tortured and died for us, died as a payment for our sins,

521
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,560
 and went in the grave and defeated death.

522
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,740
 God raised him from the dead.

523
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,860
 And so many of you here tonight, you're not a Christian.

524
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,960
 It's the most loving thing I can tell you.

525
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,460
 If you are a Christian, you don't need to be offended by that.

526
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
 Awesome.

527
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,380
 Brothers and sisters, we'll be with you forever and ever and ever.

528
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,480
 Some of you need to hear as boldly as I can say it, you're not a Christian.

529
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
 You don't know Christ.

530
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,060
 You have no relationship with him.

531
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,820
 Y'all don't talk.

532
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
 Y'all don't communicate.

533
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,100
 You don't feast on his word.

534
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,660
 And when you do, it's for the acceptance of people, not him.

535
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,980
 You don't know him.

536
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,900
 And the reason I tell you that so boldly is that can change right now.

537
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,980
 And I don't need a number.

538
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,100
 I'm not collecting stripes or trying to raise money for anything.

539
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,100
 I'm just saying the way that you become a Christian is you trust in an event that happened

540
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:37,580
 in history, that every boy you slept with, every terrible thing you've done, every porn

541
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:43,980
 that you looked at, every materialistic act you've made, every act of righteousness you've

542
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,840
 done because you think you're something special.

543
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,260
 Every time you thought about yourself too much, went on Jesus on a cross.

544
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,660
 You pay for it as a payment.

545
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,700
 God said, I love you and I don't want to punish you for your sin.

546
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,080
 So I'll punish me for your sin so that I can be with you forever and ever and ever.

547
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:09,260
 And so he got what you deserved and therefore you get what he deserves as a perfect God.

548
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,180
 You can change that right now.

549
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,700
 You can leave here as a Christian.

550
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,740
 I just think that would be a tremendous, by my estimate, about a thousand of you are not

551
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,740
 Christian here tonight.

552
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,660
 And that can change.

553
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,540
 That doesn't even account for those listening in other places.

554
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,680
 And I just think the world, the kingdom would be so much more incredible if that changed.

555
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,960
 He says in verse 21, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of

556
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,460
 heaven, but only the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven.

557
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,640
 Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your

558
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,680
 name drive out demons and in your name before many miracles.

559
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
 Then I will tell them plainly.

560
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,440
 I never knew you away from me.

561
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,840
 You evil doer.

562
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,300
 He's talking about people who thought they knew him.

563
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,780
 That should be terrifying.

564
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,800
 He's talking about people who did religious acts in his name.

565
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,320
 It says that's terrifying.

566
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,700
 And he says, I don't know you.

567
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,440
 It's like, I know he's saying, I don't, you might've known me.

568
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,080
 You might've heard of me, but I don't know you.

569
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,200
 You're not, we're not friends.

570
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,000
 You're not on the list.

571
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,360
 It's like, there's people I know, right?

572
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,120
 That don't know me.

573
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,480
 I can go to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

574
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:46,640
 I can walk up to one big, large white house and I can knock on the door and say, yes,

575
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,520
 I'm here to speak with one, Mr. Barack Obama.

576
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,240
 And they're gonna say, what's your name?

577
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,200
 You say, Jonathan, if they hadn't shot me already.

578
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,320
 And I'm gonna say, Jonathan Pakluta.

579
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,720
 And they're gonna say, I'm sorry, Barack doesn't know you.

580
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
 And I'm gonna say, well, I know him.

581
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,800
 I mean, I know everything about him.

582
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,360
 I know about his wife.

583
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,160
 I know about, I know about his family.

584
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,000
 I know about his job, his occupation.

585
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,680
 I know some decisions he's made.

586
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
 I know a lot.

587
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
 I know about his values.

588
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,000
 I know about his faith.

589
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,800
 I know about so much about him.

590
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,520
 But he doesn't know you.

591
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,400
 You're part before we shoot you.

592
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,760
 There are two types of people, my third point.

593
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,680
 There are two types of people and only one has found the path.

594
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,080
 Only one of those types of people has found the path.

595
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
 And so let me say this.

596
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,420
 I think that we mistakenly think, and this is where I want to turn that bouncer analogy

597
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
 a little bit.

598
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
 You ready?

599
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,940
 We mistakenly think that God wants to send people to hell, that God desires to keep people

600
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,020
 out of heaven.

601
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,100
 God does not want to keep you from heaven.

602
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,620
 God is begging and pleading with you into heaven right now.

603
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,020
 God does not want to send you to hell.

604
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,260
 He does not desire that.

605
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
 Show me in the scripture.

606
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,260
 Okay.

607
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
 Lots of scriptures on that.

608
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,020
 I'll give you one, one of my favorites, second Peter three, verse nine.

609
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,460
 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promises as some understand slowness.

610
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,860
 Instead, he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to

611
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,740
 repentance.

612
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:31,580
 And so here in Matthew chapter seven, Jesus contrast the father's will with religious

613
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,660
 deeds.

614
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,700
 He says, the one who gets to me is the one who has done the will of my father.

615
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,860
 What is the will of my father?

616
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:44,940
 The path that some people find few people find is to God by doing the father's will.

617
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,100
 And so the father's will ready, I'm going to give it to you.

618
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:53,940
 The father's will is that you would know him by trusting in his son, Jesus Christ.

619
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,420
 Now what does it mean to trust in his son?

620
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
 Jesus Christ.

621
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,480
 It means not to trust in yourself, but to trust in Jesus.

622
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,300
 You see this guy is before Jesus and he says, but Jesus, he doesn't say, but Jesus, you

623
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,980
 died on the cross for me.

624
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,860
 But Jesus, you were God's son in the flesh.

625
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,620
 He says, but Jesus, I prophesied in your name.

626
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
 I casted out demons in your name.

627
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,340
 Did I not do so many spiritual things?

628
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
 Did I not?

629
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,620
 Did I, I, I, but Jesus, I, but I was good.

630
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,940
 I didn't even know you, man.

631
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,040
 Depart from me.

632
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,080
 So you do the father's will.

633
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:38,840
 You trust in his provision of his son, Jesus Christ.

634
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:47,760
 The father's will is that you would not trust in yourself, but that you would trust in Jesus.

635
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,720
 Not trusting in your works or abilities, but his work on the cross.

636
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:06,160
 I was, um, the market man, stock market took a beating Thursday, Friday, Monday, today.

637
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,840
 And so yesterday I called a financial advisor and I had planned to have this small account,

638
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
 very small.

639
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
 I'm a pastor, small account.

640
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,320
 And, uh, and so I just said, Hey, I want to, I want to shut that down.

641
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,800
 And I was going to do that anyways, but this just reminded me too.

642
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,520
 We had a conversation and, um, a part of our conversation, I'll just tell you real quick

643
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,520
 is, is, you know, he said, he said, Hey, if I knew what tomorrow would hold, then I would

644
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,220
 know how to invest.

645
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,960
 And I just thought, how true is that for Christians?

646
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,800
 Like if we know that there's a heaven, then it seems like we would invest different, right?

647
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,840
 He says like, we're not going to invest here on the earth.

648
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,640
 We're going to invest where we can enjoy those investments forever and ever and ever and

649
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 ever.

650
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,760
 And that's the only reason that we don't love people as we should, because we don't believe

651
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
 in God.

652
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,360
 What's the only reason that we don't share our resources as we should, that we don't

653
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,760
 pursue the purity that he calls us to, that we don't pursue the sobriety that he calls

654
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
 us to.

655
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,680
 It's because we love ourselves more than him.

656
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,200
 And it's because we've hedged our bets.

657
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,280
 We know of the idea of God, but we don't believe in him to the point where we believe and have

658
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,640
 our hearts fully around eternity, that we're going to be there forever and ever and ever.

659
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,880
 We lose sight of that, so we do what we want.

660
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,360
 And in the midst of closing this account, see, he was my, it was my brother opened this

661
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,200
 account and then he moved on.

662
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,760
 He was a broker there and then he moved on.

663
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,200
 And so it goes to this stranger who I don't know who's had it.

664
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
 And so I'm closing this account.

665
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,220
 And so it dawned on me, I'm never going to talk to this guy again, he's an older man.

666
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,120
 And so I just said, well, I've got to share the gospel with him.

667
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,520
 So I said, Hey, can I, before I go, can I ask you two questions?

668
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,600
 And he said, sure, reluctantly.

669
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:56,680
 And I said, well, between one and 10, 10 being certain and one being not so sure, how certain

670
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,260
 are you that you would go to heaven if you died today?

671
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,400
 And so let me ask you, cause we're here together, you know, a couple thousand of us.

672
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,400
 So if you died today, between one and 10, 10 being certain and one being not so sure,

673
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,000
 how certain are you that you would go to heaven?

674
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
 And I want you to think of a number.

675
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,360
 Like I want you to get a number in your head, write it down.

676
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,480
 If that's helpful, put it in your phone between one and 10.

677
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,300
 What's, you know, think of that number, get it squarely.

678
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,300
 Is it a nine?

679
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,600
 Well, I'm pretty sure.

680
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
 Is it a five kind of coin toss?

681
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 I don't know.

682
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,440
 It depends on what kind is it.

683
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
 Is it?

684
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
 I'm absolutely for sure.

685
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,300
 100% certain I'm a 10.

686
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
 Is it a one?

687
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,140
 I know I'm not.

688
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
 What's your number?

689
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
 Everybody have a number.

690
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
 Give me a head nod.

691
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:45,700
 I'm going to call up people, not nodding their heads.

692
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,420
 He said, surprisingly so.

693
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,100
 He said a 10.

694
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,540
 This is the same question someone asked me 13 years ago.

695
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,540
 He said, I'm a 10.

696
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,540
 I'm certain.

697
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
 I'm sure.

698
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
 And I said, cool.

699
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,860
 You agreed to answer two questions.

700
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
 Second question.

701
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,900
 If you stand before God, then today, and he says, why should I let you in?

702
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,380
 What would you say?

703
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,260
 And he said, because I've been good.

704
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,260
 And he said, because my good works have outweighed my bad.

705
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
 That's a false gospel.

706
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,380
 That's a false teaching.

707
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,900
 He's the product of false teaching.

708
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,060
 I suspected that.

709
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,700
 He told me where he attended.

710
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,100
 And so I asked these questions.

711
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,200
 And he said, because my good deeds.

712
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,900
 He's this man, this section of Jesus's sermon was about this man.

713
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,900
 I was that man.

714
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,980
 I said a seven because I've tried hard 13 years ago.

715
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,020
 I was this man.

716
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
 Some of you are this man.

717
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,020
 You didn't say 10.

718
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,140
 One through nine is all the same.

719
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,420
 I have no assurance of salvation because I think it's somehow by my merit, not Christ's

720
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,100
 alone.

721
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,300
 People tell me all the time, they come up here and they say, you know, I'm a seven.

722
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
 And I say, why?

723
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,900
 And they say, because Jesus Christ died for my sins.

724
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,580
 And I say, did he die for 70% of your sins?

725
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,180
 They say no, a hundred percent of my sins.

726
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,220
 Well, then why are you a seven?

727
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,660
 Do you 70% believe that he died for a hundred percent of your sins?

728
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,180
 We have a math problem, right?

729
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,900
 Like some of us tonight, we have a math problem.

730
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,260
 Jesus Christ died for a hundred percent of your sins.

731
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,460
 All of them, everything you've done and will do.

732
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,820
 And you can trust in that right now.

733
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,860
 It's just like receiving a payment.

734
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:37,020
 It's like receiving a ticket to heaven, a ticket that Christ purchased.

735
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,260
 And you can trust in that right now.

736
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,940
 And then you live here and you do the father's will like you've trusted in that.

737
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,060
 See, we don't, we're not trying to change your behavior.

738
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,700
 We're not trying to change your investment strategy.

739
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,460
 We're trying to tell you what the future holds.

740
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,660
 Here's what the future holds.

741
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,620
 The sky's going to be opened up like a scroll and Christ is going to come back on a white

742
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,260
 horse with a big sword coming out of his mouth and a tattoo that says, king of king, Lord

743
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
 of Lords.

744
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,660
 And he's going to be looking for those who are fully his.

745
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,660
 Then he's going to say, come into my kingdom.

746
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
 Well done good and faithful servant.

747
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:11,660
 And depart from me, I never knew you, but I wanted to.

748
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,100
 But I wanted to.

749
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,500
 We know what the future holds.

750
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,180
 Why wouldn't we live like that's true?

751
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,180
 Why wouldn't you leave here tonight, wake up tomorrow and live like there's a heaven

752
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,420
 and a hell.

753
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:31,540
 And those that know Christ go to heaven and they don't just go to heaven.

754
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,540
 They walk with them here and they follow him here.

755
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,620
 And so in summary, there are two paths, but only one leads to paradise.

756
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:45,740
 There are two types of prophets, but one is a poser.

757
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,940
 And lastly, there are two types of people, but only one finds the path.

758
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:58,780
 I think that we think that Jesus is that bouncer that he's posted up here like big Luke trying

759
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,900
 to keep you out, checking the list and no, not today, big boy.

760
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,900
 You're not coming in.

761
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
 No, no, ma'am.

762
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,100
 I know what you've done.

763
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,980
 And like, like there's a party in here, but he's not letting you in.

764
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,580
 That's not who Jesus is a better picture, a better description of that reality of what

765
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:24,260
 Christ has done on the cross for your sins, because he knows how wicked you are and he's

766
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,860
 not waiting for you to get right.

767
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,380
 He makes you right.

768
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,340
 And so a better description is like the world has blown up.

769
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:36,380
 It is rotting and decaying and there's destruction and death and stench and the fragrance of

770
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,200
 evil all around you.

771
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,780
 And Christ is standing at the bomb shelter saying, come in, come in once and for all,

772
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
 come in here.

773
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
 Safety's in here.

774
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,460
 I am the way, the truth and the life.

775
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,180
 No one gets to the father except through me, but come here.

776
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,860
 I've gone to great lengths to die for your sins.

777
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,260
 All of them come in.

778
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,820
 Would you please come in?

779
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,620
 Don't go in there.

780
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,700
 Don't go in there.

781
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,420
 There's death in there.

782
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,420
 Destruction in there.

783
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
 Evil in there.

784
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
 Wickedness in there.

785
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
 Hurting morning hangovers.

786
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
 Am I pregnant?

787
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
 Oh my gosh.

788
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
 Don't go in there.

789
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
 He loves you.

790
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
 Wait, there's regret in there.

791
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:20,600
 There's sickness and death in there and disease in there.

792
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,520
 Would you please come in here?

793
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,140
 That's a, I want, I desperately want to write your name down.

794
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,140
 Please come in here.

795
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,920
 I want all of you, all of you.

796
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,380
 And as you come in, he's like, no, no, go back and get more.

797
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,860
 Go back and bring more in with you.

798
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
 Go back out there.

799
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,140
 Bring others in with you.

800
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,420
 I want to know you.

801
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,300
 I want to walk with you.

802
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:59,740
 I want to be with you forever and ever and ever, not later, today.

803
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,500
 I want to be with you at work.

804
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,580
 I want to be with you in that relationship.

805
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:11,420
 I want to be with you when you're all alone and you feel all alone.

806
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,480
 I want to be with you.

807
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,180
 You don't ever have to be all alone again.

808
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,260
 I know what you did.

809
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,940
 I know what you've done.

810
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,540
 I know what you will do.

811
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:31,980
 And I was whipped for it, tortured for it, stabbed for it.

812
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,060
 I carried a heavy piece of wood for it.

813
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:42,120
 They drove nails in my hands for it, nails in my feet for it.

814
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:51,460
 I hung on a cross for it until I couldn't breathe for it because I love you.

815
00:45:51,460 --> 00:46:00,900
 I did that because I love you and I want you to know me and the world is decaying and I

816
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:09,180
 am inviting you right now into the very narrow, small gate that few find.

817
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,580
 Would you enter with me?

818
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:19,140
 I'm going to pray now that you would and we're going to move to worshipping.

819
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:32,980
 Father, I pray we would sing songs with you now as your angels rejoice in heaven, as souls

820
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:53,620
 transfer from death to life.

821
00:46:53,620 --> 00:47:16,420
 As you have your heads bowed, I've never done this before ever in nine years of preaching,

822
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,700
 but as you have your heads bowed, and I'm not going to call you on stage and you don't

823
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,180
 have to do anything but this one thing.

824
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,980
 If you know you've been running from God, if you know that you think that you know him

825
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,220
 but you don't, and you want to walk with him from this moment on for the rest of your life,

826
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,740
 would you just raise your hand?

827
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,740
 I'm overwhelmed.

828
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,740
 That's amazing.

829
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,740
 Keep them up.

830
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,740
 Keep them up as I pray.

831
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,740
 I'm serious.

832
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:50,340
 I'm going to pray for you with your hands raised and you don't have to worry about who

833
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,340
 sees you.

834
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,340
 God sees you.

835
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,180
 That's the amazing thing.

836
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,860
 God sees you.

837
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,860
 God sees you.

838
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,860
 He knows.

839
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,220
 He knows your heart.

840
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:11,220
 Father, thank you for the truth of the gospel that changes hearts and lives.

841
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,900
 Lord, would you call us all into relationship with you?

842
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,660
 You do not delight even in the perishing of the wicked, you tell us.

843
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,700
 You don't want anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.

844
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,900
 Father, you've purchased our way to you, not by our works but by the works of your son

845
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,900
 Jesus.

846
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:39,500
 Father, for all of my brothers and sisters with their hands raised, who raised their

847
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:45,540
 hand, God, would you just give them the courage to reach out to community, to others, to other

848
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,100
 Christians saying, "Hey, I need help.

849
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,460
 I want to walk with God.

850
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:53,580
 Like a dog, I keep doing some things I don't want to do."

851
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:59,740
 Would you let them know it's not about the morality but your perfection?

852
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,900
 Thank you for that provision.

853
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,420
 In Christ's name.

854
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:12,460
 My young adult friends, I love you guys so much.

855
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,940
 I want God's very best for you.

856
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:23,860
 Would you trade in the boring, normal, stupid pursuit of pleasures on this earth to find

857
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,580
 real eternal pleasures with God?

858
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,260
 That frankly is pretty dang fun on this earth.

859
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:39,580
 And if that sounds crazy to you, I'd love to just share my story or 150 volunteers that

860
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,340
 serve with us every week that are here.

861
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,980
 They have red shirts on.

862
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,420
 And so if you were here and you were one of those that raised your hand, and just there

863
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,460
 were hundreds of you, and I'm not making that up, and that was awesome.

864
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,780
 If you're one of them and we can serve you in any way, just find someone with a red shirt

865
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,780
 and just say, "Hey, I need help.

866
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,780
 I can't do this on my own."

867
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,780
 Because you can't, by the way.

868
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,780
 You can't do it on your own.

869
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,260
 You were never meant to.

870
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,500
 And we would love to help you.

871
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,860
 There's going to be red shirts all up here and out there and everywhere.

872
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,540
 And they'd love to serve you in any way they can.

873
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,460
 And if you're here and you know that you don't have community and you're looking for that

874
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:21,120
 and you're a girl, you can walk down this hallway and there's a room in there or over

875
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,180
 there right outside this hallway, there's a room of girls that are all in search of

876
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,460
 Christian relationships in the area.

877
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,300
 And if you're a guy, you can walk down this hallway right here.

878
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,340
 And right outside this hallway is a room full of guys that are just saying, "Hey, I want

879
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,660
 to hear more about community."

880
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,140
 And our community team will be in there to talk to you about that.

881
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,900
 Community is just meeting together on a consistent basis to know God and to make Him known in

882
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,340
 the context of fellowship with others.

883
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,740
 There's a lot of Christian-ese in there, I feel like, when I say it.

884
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,860
 So I don't say it often, but that's what it is.

885
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,580
 It's going deeper with other Christians, being known, knowing them.

886
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,140
 And so if we can serve you in any way, I know it's a heavy message tonight, but it's the

887
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,900
 gospel.

888
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,900
 Every way I know how to share it with you.

889
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,140
 And so if we can talk about that all, we'd be up here.

890
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,140
 We'd love to do that.

891
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
 I love you guys.

892
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,660
 Go in peace, love, and serve the Lord.
