1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:27,560
 - Well what's up Porch, how we doing tonight?

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,560
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,600
 Hey, it's good to see you.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,800
 If this is your first time ever with us at the Porch,

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
 anyone here for the first time ever just checking it out?

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
 Awesome, it's great, glad you made it.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,480
 Hey, let me just introduce myself.

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,720
 My name is Timothy Atik

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,200
 and I'm one of the teaching pastors here on Tuesday nights

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,480
 as well as on Sunday mornings at Watermark

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,560
 and I'm so glad you made it.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,600
 Thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday evening.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,680
 I know there's a lot of places that you could be tonight,

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,240
 so we're grateful that you are spending tonight with us.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,920
 I wanna say hello to all the Porch Live locations

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,320
 that are watching right now.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,680
 I am looking at you Porch Live Greater Lafayette,

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,960
 Porch Live Fort Worth,

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,000
 and Porch Live Indy, hello.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,960
 I hope that you guys are doing great.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,560
 Thanks for streaming along with us tonight.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,200
 If you don't know what we are about here at the Porch,

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,160
 we exist to call any and every young adult

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,320
 to see Jesus and to surrender fully to life with Him.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,680
 And so we hope that Jesus comes into clear view

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
 for you this evening.

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,840
 I'm gonna start by sharing something with you

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,520
 that you're gonna be like, why is he telling us this?

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,400
 And I get it, but I'm gonna share it anyway.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,080
 Last night, my wife and I, we were getting in the car

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,400
 to go to a friend's house to watch the Rangers

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,800
 do something amazing to now be heading to the World Series,

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,740
 which is amazing.

35
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,920
 But as we were getting into the car,

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,120
 my wife's cell phone battery was almost dead.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,760
 Like it was showing red on her screen.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,920
 And so as we're getting into the car, she was like,

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
 "Hey, do you have a plug in your car?"

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,960
 And then at the same time, she answered her own question.

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
 I didn't need to answer it for her.

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,000
 She said, "Oh wait, you don't even have plugs

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,440
 "that work in your car."

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,320
 So here's the story behind that.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,920
 At some point along the journey of me having

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,040
 my really sweet 2015 Hyundai Sonata,

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,040
 at some point, all of the fuses to each of the plugs

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,760
 in the car have gone out.

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,520
 So I have two like circle,

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,300
 what we used to call cigarette lighters.

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,960
 I've got two of those in the front

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,740
 and both of those don't work.

53
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,600
 And then I have a USB plug and that doesn't work.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,640
 And then there's a cigarette lighter in the back

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,440
 and that doesn't work either.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,880
 And it's been like that now for well over a year.

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,480
 And I just live with it.

58
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
 Like my cell phone is at the point

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,940
 where somehow Apple magically knows

60
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,280
 when I'm up for an upgrade

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,020
 and then the battery just tanks all of a sudden,

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,880
 which is kind of crazy.

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,520
 But it's at that point to where my phone

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,440
 really doesn't stay charged all day long.

65
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
 And so now when I'm going on a road trip,

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,820
 I have to think, I don't have a way of charging my phone

67
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,660
 in the car.

68
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,340
 So sometimes I'll bring along like that

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,060
 little cell phone charger,

70
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,420
 or I'll have to plug it into my computer in the car.

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,160
 And I have just decided that is how I'm gonna operate.

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,840
 And you're like, "Why are you telling us this?

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,720
 "This is not even that interesting.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,500
 "Like this kind of sounds dumb

75
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,780
 "and it kind of sounds crazy."

76
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,160
 As I'm telling it, I feel a little crazy in sharing it.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,480
 Because if you hear that, you might hear that

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,180
 and just think to yourself,

79
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,360
 that's totally fixable.

80
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,840
 Like you literally, all you need to do

81
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,240
 on the way home tonight is go to Walmart for five minutes,

82
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,180
 buy a new fuse, go plug it into the car

83
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,540
 and you will have power again for your cell phone.

84
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,780
 And yet for over a year now,

85
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,800
 I have been figuring out workarounds for something

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 that is easily fixable and there is a solution.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,400
 And I tell you that because I wonder

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,380
 if that is our story when it comes to lingering sin

89
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,560
 in our lives.

90
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,580
 And you might hear that and be like,

91
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,120
 "Look, the sin in my life,

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,080
 "the stuff that I'm struggling with,

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,500
 "I've tried to fix it.

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,260
 "I've tried to get rid of it."

95
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,900
 So for you to equate my sin struggles

96
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,220
 to your little 2015 Hyundai Sonata problems,

97
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,780
 those two things should never be mentioned

98
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,660
 in the same sentence.

99
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,000
 But what I'm asking you to do is I'm asking you

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,500
 to see your sin issues from God's perspective.

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,620
 Because when you see things through God's lens,

102
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,620
 just imagine what God thinks when he looks at your sin,

103
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,140
 knowing that Christ already conquered Satan's sin

104
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,500
 and death on the cross.

105
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,660
 I wonder if God is looking at us and our sin struggles

106
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,640
 in the stuff that we allow to linger in our lives.

107
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
 And I wonder if he's like,

108
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,980
 "There's a solution and it's totally fixable.

109
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,860
 "It is totally fixable."

110
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,080
 And yet many of us go through life just with workarounds.

111
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,240
 It's just like, "Well, you know what?

112
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
 "This is just the way it is.

113
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,660
 "And this is just, I guess, who I am

114
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,420
 "and how it's always going to be.

115
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,920
 "And so I'm just gonna kind of manage life

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,880
 "and just deal with it."

117
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,200
 And tonight we're gonna continue in our series

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,440
 through the gospel of John.

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,440
 But the gospel of John exists for us to see Jesus clearly.

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,000
 That is why we've titled this series Glory.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,920
 Glory, the idea of glory is just the infinite goodness

122
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,200
 of God being displayed in our lives.

123
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,680
 We want to behold the glory of Jesus Christ.

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
 That's why each week we've just been looking

125
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
 at one aspect of Jesus.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,640
 Tonight, John chapter five is going to reveal to us

127
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,980
 Jesus, the healer.

128
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,280
 Because there is a solution to whatever sin

129
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,120
 is beating you up right now.

130
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,300
 There is a solution and it is fixable.

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,920
 But in order for you to take ground and experience joy

132
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,280
 in life and freedom, you will have to become acquainted

133
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,500
 with Jesus Christ as healer.

134
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,440
 And so here's my hope tonight.

135
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,740
 My hope is that you're gonna walk out of here

136
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,180
 with a new sense and an urgency in your heart.

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,940
 Like how crazy would it be for me to go another day

138
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,700
 just with a workaround?

139
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,920
 Because there is a solution and it is fixable.

140
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,820
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me tonight

141
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,020
 to John chapter five.

142
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,360
 John chapter five is where we're going to be.

143
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,320
 You guys out there tonight, are y'all with me?

144
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,960
 I just need to make sure.

145
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 I just want to make sure that we're good, all right?

146
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
 I know it's raining and I'm so proud of you

147
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,440
 for fighting the rain.

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,720
 I was driving here and I was like,

149
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,100
 these people are committed.

150
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,940
 Like the fact that you made it, well done.

151
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,920
 Well done, all right.

152
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,600
 Tonight, what we need to do as we walk through this text

153
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,080
 is I'm gonna invite you to answer four questions

154
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
 when it comes to the sin in your life.

155
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,760
 So here they are, I'll go ahead and give them to you

156
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,600
 so that you will see them in the passage

157
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
 as we walk through.

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,040
 The first question is this, what needs to be healed?

159
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,880
 Like what's broken in your life right now?

160
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,120
 What isn't working as it should?

161
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,000
 What needs to be healed?

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,640
 The second question is this, do you want to be healed?

163
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,380
 The third question is how do you think you will be healed?

164
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
 And then the fourth question is

165
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,920
 what's the goal of being healed, okay?

166
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,240
 So let's start with the first one.

167
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,280
 The first question is what needs to be healed?

168
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,200
 Look at what the text says, John chapter five,

169
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,120
 verses one through three.

170
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,320
 It says this, after this, there was a feast of the Jews

171
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,160
 and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

172
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,400
 Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool

173
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,720
 in Aramaic called Bethesda,

174
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,800
 which has five roofed colonnades.

175
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,680
 In these lay a multitude of invalids,

176
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,800
 blind, lame, and paralyzed.

177
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,680
 So that's the scene, Jesus goes to Jerusalem

178
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,660
 and commentators kind of debate on what this place is.

179
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,640
 But what we do know is that Jesus shows up to this place,

180
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
 there is a pool there.

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,040
 The people that are gathering there are people

182
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
 who are in need of healing.

183
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
 We know that because as we're gonna find out later,

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,120
 there's a superstition around the waters that are there

185
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,040
 and people believe that those waters can heal them.

186
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,120
 But the text tells us, John the author tells us

187
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,120
 that this is a gathering place for invalids.

188
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,760
 That's a general term that refers to people

189
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,160
 who are sick, weak, or powerless.

190
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,520
 And John kind of gives us more insight

191
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,400
 into who is in attendance.

192
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,320
 He says that there's blind people, there's lame people,

193
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,600
 and there's paralyzed people.

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,860
 So the picture that we need to get

195
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,440
 is that this is a gathering of people who need healing

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,160
 because something in their lives isn't working right.

197
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,960
 Their eyes aren't working as they should,

198
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,640
 their bodies are not working as they should.

199
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,980
 So they are in need of healing.

200
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,080
 And honestly, that's why they're there.

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,560
 They are there because they believe

202
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 that the pool can heal them.

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,920
 Now, I just wanna ask you this.

204
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
 So all eyes on me right now,

205
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,320
 as I was preparing for tonight, part of me just wondered,

206
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 I wonder if this room right now

207
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,840
 and everyone watching online, like wherever you are,

208
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,200
 I just wonder if this place isn't very different

209
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,760
 than the pool of Bethesda.

210
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,280
 What if this is a gathering of a bunch of people

211
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,060
 who are in need of healing?

212
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,600
 Like there is something in each of our lives

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,820
 that isn't working as it should.

214
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,920
 And so I just wanna ask you

215
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,840
 to take inventory of your own life.

216
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,200
 What in your life needs to be healed?

217
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,920
 What isn't working as it should?

218
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,680
 What in your life is broken?

219
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 And you might hear that word broken and think nothing.

220
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,560
 Like this is the problem with Christianity

221
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,140
 is that you wanna put problems where there are no problems.

222
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,960
 I'm not a broken person.

223
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,000
 I just wanna invite you to evaluate.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
 Like if the majority of your decisions every day,

225
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,180
 whether small or big,

226
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,200
 are driven by whether or not someone else will notice you,

227
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,200
 approve of you, or like you in real life or on social media,

228
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,420
 can't we agree that something needs healing?

229
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,920
 Like there's something broken about that.

230
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,460
 Your life is just a perpetual audition.

231
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,600
 It's like you're living in the voice

232
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,340
 where you're just wondering who it is

233
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,600
 that's gonna say, yeah, yeah,

234
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,860
 I choose you.

235
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,860
 That there's something that isn't right about that.

236
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,220
 Or what about this?

237
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,000
 If you regularly lie, exaggerate, or tell half-truths

238
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,640
 about who you are, what you have,

239
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,560
 or what you've done to make yourself look better,

240
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
 then you really are,

241
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,120
 can't we agree that something might need healing there?

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,000
 Or if you only see the negative in yourself,

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 you look in the mirror and you only see your flaws.

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
 You look at your personality

245
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,080
 and you only see what's undesirable.

246
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,840
 You look at your life and only see where you're failing.

247
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,960
 Can't we agree something needs healing there?

248
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,100
 If it doesn't take much for you to get angry.

249
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,460
 Like sometimes you just wake up angry.

250
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,560
 Like nothing even prompted it.

251
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,700
 You just wake up and you are already at that point.

252
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,640
 And when you're angry, you're explosive,

253
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,580
 or you're hurtful in the way that you think or talk or act.

254
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,160
 And you're a little out of control.

255
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,640
 Can't we agree that something

256
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,960
 might not be working as it should?

257
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,460
 Something might need healing.

258
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,560
 Or if you manipulate and use guys or girls,

259
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
 and you're numb to the fact that your actions and words

260
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,480
 cause hurt and pain in their lives, can't we agree

261
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,000
 there's something broken about that?

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,160
 Or if you find yourself consistently doing things

263
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
 that you don't wanna do despite your best efforts,

264
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,480
 whether it's looking at porn or having too much to drink

265
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,840
 or using drugs or manipulating your diet

266
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,520
 in an unhealthy way or cutting yourself,

267
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,680
 can't we agree that something needs healing?

268
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,020
 You're like, what's the point, dude?

269
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,620
 Like, just get to the point.

270
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,080
 Like I promise I didn't bring you here tonight

271
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,580
 to beat you over the head.

272
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,920
 My goal in talking about very specific things

273
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,660
 is it is good for us to start by answering the question,

274
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,680
 what in your life needs to be healed?

275
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,880
 Because there's a solution.

276
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,560
 It is fixable.

277
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,040
 There is more life to be experienced.

278
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
 Over the years, God has had to reveal to me

279
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,960
 different big things in my life that are in need of healing,

280
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,720
 whether it's a battle with lust or bitterness or resentment

281
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,920
 residing in my heart or just an unhealthy need

282
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,240
 for people's approval.

283
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,560
 Those are all things that have been broken in my life

284
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,140
 and have needed healing and continued healing.

285
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,220
 So that's the scene.

286
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,860
 Okay, John paints a picture of this gathering place

287
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,740
 for a bunch of people who are in need of healing.

288
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,020
 Now, what John is gonna do is he,

289
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,180
 and what Jesus is gonna do is he is going to zero in

290
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,220
 on one person in particular.

291
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
 Look at verse five.

292
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,740
 It says, "One man was there who had been an invalid

293
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,020
 for 38 years."

294
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,980
 So now the story goes from general to specific.

295
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,860
 And out of all the people that are gathering around the pool,

296
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,140
 Jesus chooses one guy.

297
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,420
 And the text is very clear.

298
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,580
 He has been an invalid for 38 years.

299
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,480
 He has not been able to walk for 38 years.

300
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,420
 Now, here's what I want you to see.

301
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,500
 This is a story that is meant to drive us

302
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,140
 toward knowing Jesus as healer.

303
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,100
 So the reason that John mentions

304
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,540
 that he's been an invalid for 38 years

305
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,340
 is because he wants us to feel the weight

306
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,940
 of this man's life.

307
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,940
 And he wants us to come to the conclusion

308
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,940
 that this guy has been in need of healing for 38 years.

309
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,580
 And I tell you that just because

310
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,700
 if you want to gain some perspective,

311
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,960
 and if you want to feel a little bit crazy,

312
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,420
 just take a minute and think about how long

313
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,980
 something in your life has needed healing.

314
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,140
 Like I battled pornography from the summer

315
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,380
 before my freshman year in high school

316
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,660
 until the summer before my senior year in college.

317
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,660
 I lived in the grips of pornography for seven years.

318
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,260
 That's how long I was in need of healing

319
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,400
 from a deep battle with pornography.

320
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,140
 I shared this at church on Sunday,

321
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,380
 but there was a time years ago

322
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,340
 when I was actually an intern here

323
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,540
 at Watermark Community Church.

324
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,300
 This was back in 2005.

325
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,460
 Some of y'all are like, I was four then.

326
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,580
 Okay, that's great.

327
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,620
 But back in 2005, I was interning here

328
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,140
 and I had to step off of staff

329
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,140
 because of some really compromising decisions

330
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
 that I had made.

331
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,360
 And, but I left bitter.

332
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,900
 There was a few people on the church staff

333
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,180
 that I left feeling hurt by.

334
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,180
 And what happened was that hurt transformed into bitterness.

335
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,180
 And that bitterness began to grow inside of my soul

336
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,460
 like a weed and it overtook everything unhealthy.

337
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,220
 It overtook everything healthy in me.

338
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,860
 And so this is what it looked like.

339
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,900
 Like there was a time, I want you to think about this.

340
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,300
 I'm standing on the stage of Watermark now.

341
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,700
 There was a time when, when I would come to Dallas,

342
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,900
 I couldn't stand to drive past Watermark.

343
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,500
 Like to be on 635 and to see Watermark,

344
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 I literally felt nauseous.

345
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,340
 There was a time when if I heard certain names of people

346
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,380
 that worked at Watermark, I would want ill for them.

347
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,700
 Like if something negative was said about them,

348
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,860
 I felt some gratification with it.

349
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,660
 Like that was a reality.

350
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
 And I became the drama friend.

351
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,020
 Like anytime I would be with some of my closest friends,

352
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,320
 do you know what they were hearing about?

353
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,360
 They were hearing about my bitterness towards Watermark.

354
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,020
 Do you know how long that bitterness raged in my life?

355
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,980
 Four years.

356
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,980
 Four years that bitterness took over my soul like a weed.

357
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,380
 And then God finally in his kindness intervened

358
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,860
 and he has done a miraculous work

359
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,980
 to not only restore those relationships

360
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,620
 to a point now where those are friends,

361
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,060
 but he's brought me back to Watermark.

362
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,900
 But healing had to take place.

363
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,840
 But I look back and I feel a little crazy

364
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,840
 when I look back on that season to think four years

365
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,940
 I allowed myself to be robbed of life.

366
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,100
 For four years I needed healing and resisted it.

367
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,300
 With pornography for seven years I missed out on life.

368
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,560
 I lived with something broken.

369
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,860
 Imagine if my opening illustration with the outlets,

370
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,700
 I was like, yeah, it's been like that for seven years.

371
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,260
 Wouldn't you be like, dude, just get a new car.

372
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,920
 Just buy a new car, be done with it, it's time.

373
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,460
 You'd be like, this is so crazy.

374
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,280
 I'll go buy the fuses for you.

375
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,640
 Just point me to your car, I'll put them in it.

376
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,660
 It'll take me five minutes and we'll be done with it.

377
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,460
 But when I just want to invite you,

378
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,140
 just think how long has something been broken?

379
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,840
 How long have you been missing out on life?

380
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,300
 How long have you been looking at porn?

381
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,440
 How long have you been auditioning for people's approval?

382
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,820
 How long have you been cutting yourself

383
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,040
 for starving yourself?

384
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,940
 That's how long you've been missing out on wholeness.

385
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,780
 That's how long you've needed healing.

386
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,580
 Now, here's the thing.

387
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,700
 When we allow something to remain broken in our lives,

388
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,180
 when there is a solution and it is fixable,

389
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,820
 but when we allow it to move in and make itself at home,

390
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,260
 do you know what we begin believing?

391
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,620
 We begin believing that this is just the way it is

392
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,580
 and this is just who we are.

393
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,660
 I'm just an angry person.

394
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,300
 I'm just a lustful person.

395
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,160
 I'm just an insecure person.

396
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,220
 This is just who I am and that is a lie

397
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,740
 from the pit of hell because you are a child of God

398
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,780
 and what God says about you is way more significant

399
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,500
 than what our enemy, the devil, who is a liar

400
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,800
 has to say to you about you.

401
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,380
 Are you guys out there?

402
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,140
 I just need to make sure.

403
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,560
 I'm sorry I keep checking.

404
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,860
 I'm just, I'm making sure.

405
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,700
 Okay.

406
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,280
 So then here's what's gonna happen.

407
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,500
 Is Jesus is going to interrupt this man's life

408
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,460
 with a question and it's gonna be the second question

409
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,660
 I wanna invite you to answer.

410
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,940
 These are just Jesus's words.

411
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,180
 Look at what Jesus says in verse six.

412
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,260
 It says this, "When Jesus saw him lying there

413
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,840
 "and knew that he had already been there a long time,

414
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,900
 "he said to him, 'Do you wanna be healed?'"

415
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,900
 That's the second question, do you wanna be healed?

416
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,900
 Can you imagine being the guy who hasn't walked in

417
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,100
 38 years and you've been laying by this pool day after day

418
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,260
 and this guy just walks up and matter of factly asks you,

419
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,280
 hey man, do you wanna be healed?

420
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,860
 What's he gonna say, no?

421
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,980
 Like no man, I'm good, but that blind guy,

422
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,280
 I bet he would love it, but I'm good.

423
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,420
 No.

424
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,660
 But Jesus walks up in just a moment,

425
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,860
 he assumes that the impossible is possible.

426
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,340
 And if you're talking to a guy who hasn't walked in 38 years

427
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,040
 and you ask him, do you wanna be healed?

428
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,300
 I would imagine that the answer is always yes.

429
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,380
 But when you switch into the spiritual realm

430
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,040
 and you're talking about sin,

431
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,340
 it becomes a much more thoughtful question

432
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,220
 that requires a thoughtful answer.

433
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,300
 Because something that you need to evaluate

434
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,620
 is when it comes to what needs healing in your life,

435
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,700
 you really need to evaluate, do you wanna be healed?

436
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,660
 Like, do you actually want to be healed?

437
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,660
 Because if your answer is yes,

438
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,060
 what you have to understand is if Jesus invades your life

439
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,060
 and goes to work on the thing that is broken in your life,

440
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,980
 two things are probably gonna happen.

441
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,500
 Number one, Jesus will have to uproot that sin

442
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,080
 from your life and sin can be really enjoyable.

443
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,760
 The second thing that you need to know

444
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,500
 is Jesus might ask you to make tough decisions

445
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,960
 in order to be done with that sin.

446
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,860
 So let's just take those two issues.

447
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,340
 One is that Jesus is gonna step in

448
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,180
 and do some uprooting in your life.

449
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,540
 So I'll explain it this way, and this is not a dating talk,

450
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,620
 and I'm not even really talking

451
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,180
 about relationships right now,

452
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,100
 although I'm gonna use a relationship illustration

453
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,260
 to kind of take you where I want you to go.

454
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,600
 I've counseled a lot of people over the years

455
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,640
 who have been in unhealthy dating relationships,

456
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,120
 and I can sit down with a guy or a girl

457
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
 and they can start unpacking their relationship,

458
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,040
 and as they're talking, it's so incredibly clear

459
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,280
 that their relationship is so packed full of drama

460
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,760
 and unhealth and impurity and insecurity

461
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,080
 and someone's using the other

462
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,880
 and one person is cheating on,

463
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,020
 and it's just so unhealthy.

464
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,820
 And so do you know what my encouragement is?

465
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,780
 I think it's time to get out of the relationship.

466
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,660
 Like it is time to let this thing go.

467
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,500
 Why?

468
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,100
 Because this relationship is stealing from you.

469
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,420
 And yet there's been different times

470
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,740
 where I've encouraged them,

471
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,820
 I think it's time to get out of the relationship,

472
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,420
 and they haven't taken the advice.

473
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,140
 Do you wanna know why?

474
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,380
 Here's the exact words.

475
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,160
 I just can't imagine my life without him in it.

476
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,780
 I just can't imagine my life without her in it.

477
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,940
 Do you know what's happening?

478
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,900
 Is that they are afraid to let go of something

479
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,840
 that might be stealing from them,

480
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,080
 and yet it's still giving them something.

481
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,400
 Maybe it's giving them companionship.

482
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 Maybe it's giving them plans on the weekend.

483
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,440
 Maybe it's giving them the hope of getting married

484
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,080
 instead of still being single,

485
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,480
 and so they're scared to let it go.

486
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,320
 It's possible that this might be similar

487
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,280
 to your relationship with sin.

488
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,640
 Like you might, if you were honest,

489
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,360
 you might say, I just can't imagine my life

490
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,000
 without alcohol in it.

491
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,920
 Like what if people don't like the sober me?

492
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,000
 Like I just can't imagine my life without pornography in it.

493
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,040
 Like where am I gonna get a release from?

494
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,560
 I can't imagine my life without overspending

495
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,760
 because how boring will my life become

496
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,780
 if I can't eat out when I wanna eat out

497
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,640
 and go on the trip when I wanna go on the trip

498
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,280
 and wear what I wanna wear?

499
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,720
 Like what?

500
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,720
 I don't know that I can imagine my life without this in it.

501
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,840
 And so it's just, it's good to realize

502
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,160
 that you might not be ready to be healed yet

503
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,200
 because you still think your sin is giving you something

504
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,720
 that you can't live without.

505
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,640
 But then the second thing that might happen

506
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,360
 is Jesus might ask you to make tough decisions

507
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,680
 in order for him to accomplish his healing in your life.

508
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,880
 So I told y'all that I wrestled with pornography

509
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,080
 for seven years, and do you know what finally happened

510
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,120
 as I reached a point in my life where I made the decision,

511
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,160
 I'm willing to do whatever it takes

512
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,440
 to be done with pornography.

513
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,400
 I'll do whatever it takes.

514
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,440
 And so I literally, I put myself in a place

515
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,360
 where there wasn't a 1% chance of me looking at porn.

516
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,040
 Like I just didn't have access to it.

517
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,160
 And that's what I needed in my life.

518
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,920
 Like I had to put myself in a position

519
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,880
 where like I didn't care how inconvenient it would be.

520
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,360
 Like if I had to go only to the public library

521
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,200
 to use the computers there to get on the internet,

522
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,920
 like it was worth it.

523
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,440
 That's the place that I got to.

524
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,200
 And over the years, people have heard my story with porn

525
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,480
 and they've been like, "Hey, can we get coffee

526
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,160
 "and let's sit down and talk about it."

527
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,240
 And so I will sit with people and I'm like,

528
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,280
 "Hey, let me just ask you, are you at a place

529
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,880
 "where you're kind of willing to do whatever it takes

530
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,960
 "to be done with porn?"

531
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,440
 Like for Jesus to go to work and to uproot it

532
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,280
 from your life.

533
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,120
 And I begin to talk to them about some of the decisions

534
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,080
 that I had to make, which were tough decisions.

535
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,480
 And as I'm explaining it, they drop eye contact with me.

536
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
 They start looking around and they're like,

537
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,160
 "Oh shoot, like there's not like just a lever I can pull

538
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,760
 "where it's like the porn lever is now turned off.

539
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,200
 "Like it's no longer a temptation.

540
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,760
 "I can just carry my phone around

541
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,200
 "and it's not gonna be a problem."

542
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,480
 And so they just totally disengage from the conversation.

543
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,320
 Why?

544
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,200
 'Cause they thought I was gonna just hand them freedom,

545
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,800
 like a freedom pill where you just pop it

546
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,520
 and it's like, "Okay, it worked.

547
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,720
 "Well, that's over."

548
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,040
 And yet, and so what it shows me is like,

549
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,720
 "Okay, you're not ready to be free yet.

550
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,000
 "And please don't hear me talking about

551
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,320
 "like it's all like effort."

552
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,360
 You know, I'm just saying that Jesus gives us wisdom.

553
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,200
 And one of the ways that Jesus moves and works in our lives

554
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,200
 is he calls us away from the habits and the rhythms

555
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,160
 that naturally pull us back toward our sin.

556
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,120
 And so you might hear all of that.

557
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,280
 And you might hear Jesus's question now

558
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
 in a different light.

559
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,680
 If he's looking at you saying, "Do you wanna be healed?"

560
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,640
 Some of you might be honest and say,

561
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,880
 "At this point, not really."

562
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,280
 And others of you are like, "Yes, I wanna be healed

563
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,960
 "because I see my sin clearly.

564
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,160
 "Like the thing that I thought was giving me life

565
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,840
 "is stealing from me.

566
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,880
 "Like it's worth it.

567
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,600
 "Whatever, whatever Jesus asks me to do,

568
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,080
 "whatever is necessary, I will do it."

569
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,400
 The third question that I wanna invite you to ask

570
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,680
 from this passage is this,

571
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,720
 "How do you think you'll be healed?"

572
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
 Like, how do you think it'll be accomplished?

573
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,200
 Look at how the man responds in verse seven.

574
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,240
 Says the sick man, now he's responding to Jesus's question,

575
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,080
 "Do you wanna be healed?"

576
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,360
 It says this in verse seven, "The sick man answered him,

577
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,520
 "'Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool

578
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,400
 "'when the water is stirred up.

579
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,440
 "'And while I'm going, another steps down before me.'"

580
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,680
 So do you see his response?

581
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,480
 He's like, "Look, man, I do wanna be healed,

582
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,960
 "but the problem is I don't have anyone to help

583
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,760
 "put me into the waters when the waters are stirred."

584
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,720
 So here's what you need to understand.

585
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,840
 There was this superstition at this point in time

586
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,840
 that periodically the waters would get stirred

587
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,880
 by some supernatural force,

588
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,080
 and the first person to get in the waters

589
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,440
 when they were supernaturally stirred would be healed.

590
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,440
 Now, this guy's response is both wrong

591
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,160
 and right at the same time.

592
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,920
 What makes this guy's response wrong

593
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,880
 is that he believes that something else

594
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,320
 will bring healing to his life besides Jesus.

595
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
 He believes that the thing that will heal him

596
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,640
 is the pool that is supernaturally stirred periodically.

597
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,720
 And let me just tell you,

598
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,560
 when it comes to dealing with sin in your life,

599
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,280
 Jesus is the only one who's ever gone to war with sin

600
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,920
 and conquered it.

601
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,040
 And so at the root of whatever your struggle is,

602
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,960
 there's sin there.

603
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,960
 There's a lie that is being believed there.

604
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,240
 And Jesus Christ left heaven, came to earth,

605
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,000
 went to the cross, and on that cross,

606
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,120
 listen to the words of 1 John 3, 8.

607
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,240
 It's not gonna be on the screen,

608
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,840
 but it says that the Son of God

609
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,840
 appeared to destroy the works of the devil.

610
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,160
 That's why he came.

611
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,600
 He came to destroy the works of the devil.

612
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,960
 He is the only one who's done that and succeeded.

613
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
 So I tell you that just to say,

614
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,320
 look, if your greatest hope

615
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,480
 for finding healing and freedom from your sin,

616
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,000
 it's found in Jesus.

617
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 It is found in Jesus.

618
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
 The thing that was right about this guy's response

619
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,840
 is that he said,

620
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,360
 I don't have anyone to help me into the waters.

621
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,560
 He believed that it would require the help of others

622
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,640
 in order for him to experience healing.

623
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,720
 And I think that there's a lot of truth to this

624
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,080
 because a lot of times God will use his people

625
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,880
 to bring healing into the lives of his people.

626
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,880
 And so that's why James tells us in James 5, 16,

627
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,640
 he says, "Therefore confess your sins to one another

628
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
 "and pray for one another."

629
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,360
 Why?

630
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,240
 "That you may be healed."

631
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,400
 God rarely will heal someone in isolation.

632
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,240
 Why?

633
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,080
 Because he loves you.

634
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,600
 And that's why the Bible starts out

635
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,240
 in the second chapter of the whole thing,

636
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,480
 it says, "It is not good for man to be alone."

637
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,320
 Why?

638
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,640
 Because God values community.

639
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
 Like when you become a Christian,

640
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,840
 one of the most beautiful benefits of knowing Jesus Christ

641
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,520
 is not just that it's now, it's just me and Jesus,

642
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,480
 like we're just gonna do our thing,

643
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,480
 I just need him and he just wants me.

644
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,200
 No, he invites you into the family of God

645
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,320
 to where now you have brothers and sisters in the faith.

646
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,200
 I don't even know some of your names

647
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,880
 and yet you're my brothers in Christ,

648
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,640
 you're my sisters in Christ.

649
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,160
 We're in the same family.

650
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,920
 We can help one another out.

651
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,920
 We can encourage one another to look like children of God,

652
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
 to walk in freedom from sin.

653
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,320
 God uses his people to bring healing

654
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,400
 into the lives of his people.

655
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
 So I tell you that just to say,

656
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,160
 maybe your first step is just allowing yourself

657
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,640
 to be known and loved, like to call a friend tonight

658
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,920
 and to just say, "Man, I just need to let you know

659
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,920
 "this thing is broken in my life and I need help."

660
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,760
 Or maybe you're gonna make a decision

661
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,400
 to show up to regeneration next Monday night.

662
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,400
 Regeneration is our recovery program for anyone

663
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,360
 who is wanting to break free from sin in their lives.

664
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,800
 Look at how Jesus responds to this guy, verse eight.

665
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,080
 This is kind of the climax of the story.

666
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,320
 Jesus said to him, "Get up."

667
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,520
 Can you imagine that?

668
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,480
 I just want you, like anytime you read the Bible,

669
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,280
 anytime you read a story, especially in the gospels,

670
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,000
 try and put yourself there.

671
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,520
 Try and see what we're reading.

672
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,760
 Try and visualize it.

673
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
 Try and hear it.

674
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,320
 Try and smell it.

675
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,640
 Like see it in color.

676
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,440
 So you got a guy who hasn't walked in 38 years

677
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,240
 and Jesus looks at him and he's like, "Hey man, get up."

678
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,280
 Like that's a big deal.

679
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,040
 That's a moment of faith where you either are like,

680
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,400
 "No, we're not gonna do that."

681
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,000
 But just imagine he says, "Get up.

682
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,720
 "Take up your bed and walk."

683
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,520
 And at once, the text is very clear, at once.

684
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,520
 Not over a long period of time.

685
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,720
 Not progressively.

686
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,200
 At once the man was healed

687
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
 and he took up his bed and walked.

688
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,320
 Can you imagine just seeing how his legs respond

689
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,760
 to feeling something for the first time in 38 years?

690
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,600
 Like, I don't know what he did when he hopped up.

691
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,920
 It'd be kind of, I just would have loved to be there.

692
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,360
 Like what was his first movement?

693
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,440
 But who brought the healing?

694
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
 It was Jesus Christ.

695
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,520
 And when Jesus' life and this man's life collided,

696
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,280
 it changed everything.

697
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,800
 This guy felt feeling in his legs for the first time.

698
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,720
 This guy moved in certain ways

699
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,800
 that he had never moved before.

700
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,080
 This guy saw things from a perspective

701
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,520
 that he had never seen from.

702
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,000
 He changed everything.

703
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,600
 Now this guy has no reason to be lying

704
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,800
 by the pool of Bethesda.

705
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,760
 So he just changed this guy's entire routine.

706
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,000
 All of his rhythms.

707
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 His life was completely changed.

708
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,840
 And yet we're talking about Jesus healing our souls.

709
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,800
 And so I just want to stand up here before you

710
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,600
 and say, it really works.

711
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,880
 Jesus is healer.

712
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,600
 I know the healing power of Jesus Christ over pornography.

713
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,200
 I stand up here tonight and testify

714
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,920
 that he ransomed me from it.

715
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,320
 He broke me free from it.

716
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,280
 Like I know the,

717
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,800
 (audience applauding)

718
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,520
 I know the healing power of Jesus Christ over bitterness.

719
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,040
 The fact that I even walked into this building tonight

720
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,080
 is the grace of God in my life

721
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,440
 that he stripped out the bitterness of my soul.

722
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,760
 And I call those people friends.

723
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,680
 I have watched the healing power of Jesus Christ

724
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,320
 in so many different people's lives.

725
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,400
 I remember a guy coming up to me

726
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,600
 and showing me the scars on his arms from cutting himself.

727
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,240
 And he talked about,

728
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,960
 he has experienced the healing power of Jesus Christ

729
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,280
 over his life, from the self-hate that he was living in.

730
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,600
 I've seen the healing power of Jesus over alcohol and drugs.

731
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,840
 I've witnessed it over and over again.

732
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,480
 If you wanna know the answer to how will you be healed?

733
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,800
 Here's the answer, Jesus Christ, period.

734
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,840
 Healing is found in Jesus Christ.

735
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,920
 And that can be true for you.

736
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,160
 Don't look at me as like, well, of course you're a pastor.

737
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,120
 So like, you're gonna have those stories of healing

738
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,440
 because there's like,

739
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,240
 you've got some like special connection to God.

740
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,240
 No, I'm just another child of God.

741
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,440
 I'm just another kid in the family.

742
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,800
 There is nothing more special about me than you.

743
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,600
 In fact, like I've still got my own things in my life

744
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,320
 that I still need healing from.

745
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,840
 And yet in those areas of my life, I can say, no,

746
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,440
 the reason that I'll seek healing

747
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,640
 in other areas of my life now

748
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,960
 is because I've known Jesus to be healer in the past.

749
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,160
 And you can know him as healer too.

750
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,520
 The final question that I wanna invite you to answer

751
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,040
 is this, what's the goal of being healed?

752
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,840
 What's the goal of being healed?

753
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,360
 This story takes a really weird turn.

754
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,560
 And I'm gonna read a big chunk, but I want you to see it.

755
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,280
 It doesn't have the outcome that you would hope

756
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,000
 that it has in this guy's life.

757
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,560
 'Cause this guy gets up, he rolls up his mat

758
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,040
 and carries it home.

759
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,680
 Now watch this.

760
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,920
 The end of verse nine, it says,

761
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,560
 "Now that day was the Sabbath.

762
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,680
 "So the Jews said to the man who had been healed,

763
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
 "it's the Sabbath and it's not lawful

764
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,880
 "for you to take up your bed.

765
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,080
 "But he answered them, the man who healed me,

766
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,480
 "that man said to me, take up your bed and walk.

767
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,640
 "They asked him, who is the man who said to you,

768
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,840
 "take up your bed and walk?

769
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,960
 "Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was

770
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,920
 "for Jesus had withdrawn as there was a crowd in the place.

771
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,920
 "Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him,

772
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,800
 "see, you are well, sin no more,

773
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,200
 "that nothing worse may happen to you."

774
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,200
 Watch this, verse 15, "The man went away and told the Jews

775
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,840
 "that it was Jesus who had healed him."

776
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,680
 And verse 16 goes on and says,

777
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,120
 "And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus."

778
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,880
 Isn't that weird?

779
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,000
 This guy has been healed and they're like,

780
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,160
 "And they're like, who healed you?"

781
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
 He's like, "I don't know."

782
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,480
 That's kind of red flag number one.

783
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,360
 Like if a guy heals you, like common courtesy,

784
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
 hey man, what's your name?

785
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
 (congregation laughing)

786
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,280
 Jesus, Jesus, thank you.

787
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,040
 I don't know if you know this,

788
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,600
 I haven't been able to walk in 38 years

789
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,680
 and now because of you, I can.

790
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,600
 So Jesus, thank you.

791
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,680
 It's all it takes, learn a name.

792
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,120
 But you know what the second thing that's concerning is?

793
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,240
 The Jews come to him, they're like, "Who was it?"

794
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,080
 He's like, "I don't know."

795
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,320
 And Jesus finds him, he's like, "Well, I'm Jesus."

796
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,440
 And he's like, "Good, now I have a name."

797
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,920
 And he goes back to the Jews, he's like,

798
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,120
 "I got a name for you."

799
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,080
 It was Jesus.

800
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,840
 And that's what prompted them to start persecuting Jesus.

801
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:46,880
 How weird that this guy's life was radically changed

802
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,320
 by Jesus and yet he didn't know Jesus

803
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,080
 or have a sense of any allegiance to Jesus.

804
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,120
 And I look at this and here's my conclusion.

805
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,560
 He wanted healing, but he didn't want the healer.

806
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,320
 He wanted healing, but he didn't want the healer.

807
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,880
 And so the question I'm asking is,

808
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,760
 what is the goal of being healed?

809
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
 Like, be honest with yourself.

810
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,920
 Is your goal simply so that you don't feel

811
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,640
 like a failure anymore?

812
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,440
 Is the goal so that you will just feel

813
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,220
 like you're crushing life more,

814
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,560
 like you're realizing that some of your habits

815
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,440
 are getting in the way of you really getting

816
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,980
 to where you wanna be professionally?

817
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,820
 So you're like, "You know what?

818
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,480
 "I just need to clean some things up

819
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,240
 "so that I can crush life better."

820
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,760
 Is the goal so just that you can feel better,

821
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,000
 like you're in a better place to get married?

822
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,620
 What is it?

823
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,960
 What I want you to understand is that Jesus

824
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,320
 is not a means to an end.

825
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,880
 He is the end.

826
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,080
 (congregation applauding)

827
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,560
 So let me just talk very personally, okay?

828
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,160
 Because if that's where you are,

829
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,600
 if you're like, "Oh man, this is okay.

830
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,660
 "I feel convicted.

831
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,820
 "Like, I want the healing.

832
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,820
 "I don't know about the healer.

833
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,520
 "I just want the healing."

834
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,680
 So here's been my experience.

835
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,520
 I get it.

836
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,360
 I understand.

837
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,560
 Like, the time that I worked at Watermark

838
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,160
 and had to step off staff, it was due to sin

839
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
 in my own life.

840
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,160
 And everything, I mean, I lost my job.

841
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:31,160
 Everything kind of came crumbling down in my world.

842
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,420
 And so I got on a plane and I left the country.

843
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,280
 And at first, you know what I wanted?

844
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,840
 I just wanted God to do a lot of healing really quickly

845
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,600
 so that I would be in a good place to date again.

846
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,240
 I wanted to just be in a good place

847
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,400
 to where I could date and get married to someone, honestly.

848
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,880
 Like, that's me just being honest saying,

849
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,500
 "I wanted the healing more than the healer."

850
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,120
 But what happened when I left the country

851
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,640
 is every day I just began to give myself over to the Lord.

852
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,680
 Like, all I could do every day

853
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,280
 was just spend time, a lot of time,

854
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
 just listening to God through his word.

855
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,160
 And then I'd open up my journal every day.

856
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,980
 I'd just pour my heart out to the Lord in prayers.

857
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,680
 I would write to friends at home,

858
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,880
 just telling them what God was doing in my life.

859
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,540
 And in the midst of wanting healing, you know what happened?

860
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,440
 Was I found the healer in a way that I never had before.

861
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,200
 And I came home more in love with Jesus

862
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,440
 than I had ever loved him.

863
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
 And I began to see Jesus more clearly

864
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,680
 than I had ever seen him in my life.

865
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,840
 And I realized that the goal in dealing with my sin,

866
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,460
 it wasn't the healing, it was the healer.

867
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,420
 It was just to be with Jesus more.

868
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,160
 It was to see Jesus more.

869
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,880
 Matthew 5, 8, Jesus says this,

870
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,880
 "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."

871
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,340
 That's why we want Jesus to uproot sin from our lives.

872
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,160
 That's why we want him to purify our hearts.

873
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,320
 Why?

874
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,780
 So that we'll see God.

875
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,940
 But here's the reality.

876
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,580
 When you're not seeing God clearly, you fall into sin.

877
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:16,360
 And the reason that you choose sin over God

878
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,660
 is because you're not seeing God clearly.

879
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,600
 And what's happening is that you're hydrating yourself

880
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,580
 with salt water and it looks like the answer,

881
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,240
 but it's not the answer.

882
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,800
 But this shift has to come

883
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,020
 where you begin to take a step of faith,

884
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,860
 where you begin to believe just possibly

885
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:47,500
 that Jesus can satisfy you in a way that your sin can't.

886
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,540
 That he's actually better than your sin is.

887
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,400
 And that's a step of faith

888
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,200
 where you can't see Jesus that clearly,

889
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,020
 but you take a step of faith where you just say,

890
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,620
 look, Jesus, I don't just want healing, I want the healer.

891
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,980
 I want to know you more.

892
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,140
 Because I believe that in you is life.

893
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,980
 You are the bread of life.

894
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,700
 You're the only one who can truly satisfy

895
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,220
 the deepest longings of my soul.

896
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,900
 So Jesus, would you come and would you satisfy me?

897
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,260
 And then I just wanna end tonight by saying,

898
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,380
 if you're here tonight

899
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,580
 and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,

900
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,860
 here's what I want you to understand.

901
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,700
 The reason that things in your life are broken

902
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,980
 is because your relationship with God is broken.

903
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,380
 And the guy in the story,

904
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,660
 it shows us what makes Christianity

905
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,740
 and what makes Jesus so great.

906
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,060
 Like, did you think about the fact

907
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,420
 that Jesus just sought this one guy out?

908
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,500
 Like there's a lot of people who needed to be healed,

909
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,280
 but he came up to this one guy.

910
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,100
 And it's possible that Jesus brought you here tonight

911
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,340
 because he is singling you out.

912
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,300
 He is coming after you

913
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,500
 because he wants to do a significant work in your life.

914
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,500
 But what's different between us and this guy

915
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,400
 is that we aren't just paralyzed by sin,

916
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,500
 we are dead in our sin.

917
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,820
 That's what the Bible says,

918
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,940
 that we are dead in our sin,

919
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,820
 which means a dead person is incapable

920
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,100
 of doing anything that would be pleasing to God.

921
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,140
 We can't make ourselves right with God.

922
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,120
 And yet his question to you tonight is,

923
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,980
 do you wanna be healed?

924
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,680
 Like, do you want a real relationship with Jesus Christ

925
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,500
 where he can forgive all of your sins

926
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,540
 and make you right with your maker?

927
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:40,260
 See, this guy thought that something else could heal him.

928
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,980
 And you can take that posture too.

929
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,260
 You can say, well, you know, I'm just gonna try harder.

930
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,460
 I'm gonna do better.

931
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,280
 And you know what?

932
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,660
 I'll just find my own way and find my own spirituality.

933
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,540
 But let's just be clear,

934
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,780
 only Jesus could heal that guy

935
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,780
 and only Jesus can heal your relationship with God.

936
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,080
 Your relationship with God is broken.

937
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,220
 That man's life was changed.

938
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,300
 But when you put your faith in Jesus Christ,

939
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,660
 where you come to a place where you just say,

940
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,500
 Jesus, I want you to be my savior,

941
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,220
 he doesn't just change your life,

942
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,740
 he makes your life new.

943
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,300
 And that's what's on the table for you tonight,

944
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,500
 complete forgiveness, complete newness,

945
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,980
 a right relationship with God.

946
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,940
 So I'm just gonna ask you to respond tonight.

947
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,220
 However you wanna respond.

948
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,500
 If you don't know Jesus

949
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,780
 and you wanna begin a relationship with Jesus,

950
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,500
 then talk to him tonight, pray to him,

951
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,780
 invite him into your life.

952
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,460
 If there's something broken in your life

953
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,420
 and you wanna pray with someone,

954
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,660
 there's gonna be people down front,

955
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,700
 we'll be down front, we'd love to talk to you.

956
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,900
 If we can counsel you, we'd love to do that.

957
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,880
 If we can pray for you, we want to do that.

958
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,580
 Maybe you just sit in your seat as we sing

959
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,460
 and you just say, God, I'm finally at a point,

960
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,500
 I want to be healed.

961
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,780
 Maybe you text a friend and just say, man, I gotta talk.

962
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,100
 Can we talk about what's going on?

963
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,660
 Or maybe you make a decision right now,

964
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,780
 you're gonna come to Regen next Monday.

965
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,740
 But let's take a step, and then I'm just gonna say this,

966
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,380
 this is a little bit different,

967
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,100
 but some people here tonight,

968
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,100
 you read this story about Jesus physically healing this guy.

969
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,380
 And you're like, man, I wish Jesus would still heal,

970
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,740
 physically today.

971
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,740
 If you'd like someone to pray over you for physical healing,

972
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,980
 I don't know what Jesus is doing in your life,

973
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,820
 but we'd love to pray for you as well.

974
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,220
 Let me close this in prayer.

975
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:48,700
 Lord Jesus, I pray that you would come

976
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,100
 and just have your way, do a work in our lives.

977
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,260
 I pray that our hearts would be soft towards you, God.

978
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,020
 Would you show us what in our lives is in need of healing,

979
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,380
 Lord, and I pray that we would just sense you asking us

980
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,100
 the question tonight, do you want to be healed?

981
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,100
 And I pray that the desire of our heart would be yes,

982
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,460
 Lord God, I pray that we would realize

983
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,580
 that healing is found in you, Lord Jesus.

984
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,860
 And I pray that the ultimate goal would be to get you,

985
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,380
 more of you, God.

986
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,940
 May we see you in a way that we've never seen you.

987
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,220
 We love you.

988
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:31,600
 We respond to you now in Jesus name, amen.

989
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:41,600
