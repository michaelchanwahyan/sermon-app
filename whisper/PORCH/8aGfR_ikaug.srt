00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,040
 Let me start tonight by reading from Psalm 46, where we'll be.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,040
 "God is our refuge and strength and ever-present help in trouble.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,040
 and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea,

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,040
 though its waters roar and foam and mountains quake with their surging.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,040
 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,040
 the holy place where the Most High dwells.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,040
 God is within her; she will not fall.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,040
 God will help her at break of day.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,040
 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 He lifts His voice; the earth melts.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,040
 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
 Come and see what the Lord has done,

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,040
 the desolations He has brought on the earth.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
 He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
 He turns the shields with fire.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,040
 He says, 'Be still and know that I am God.'

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
 I will be exalted among the nations.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
 I will be exalted in the earth.

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 The Lord Almighty is with us.

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 The God of Jacob is our fortress."

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,040
 Let me pray.

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 God of Jacob, Lord Almighty, God of hosts,

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,040
 I ask that you would take this ancient writing,

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,040
 this scripture, this documentation of a celebration of victory

34
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
 and that you would bring it to life tonight,

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,040
 that we would apply it to our lives in Dallas and Fort Worth and Houston

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
 or wherever we would tune in from around the world.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,040
 That we would take what the Sons of Korah meant as a celebration

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,040
 and we would be able to apply it to our lives,

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,040
 not just our battles, but the victory that we have in Christ,

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 the forgiveness of sins that we've received through Him,

41
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 and the relationship that we have with you because of it.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:56,040
 Thank you for this time and for all that you will do over the next few minutes together.

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
 In Christ's name, amen.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 Two weeks ago was absolutely crazy for me.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 It was an extraordinary week, not a normal week.

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,040
 I had taught in Waco on Sunday three times, taught there Monday night,

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
 came back here for the porch, taught Tuesday here, stayed late,

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
 left about 10.30 p.m., got home at 11, woke up the next morning at 5.30

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,040
 and came and taught again that Wednesday morning.

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
 All different messages. Again, that's not normal.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,040
 Leadership here does a phenomenal job of making sure that I and my peers

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,040
 run a sustainable pace, but that week was just exceptionally heavy.

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 It was all okay, and here's why.

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,040
 I taught Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and that Thursday,

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
 Monica and I were leaving for vacation.

56
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,040
 We were going to Mexico. This was our 10-year anniversary trip

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
 that we're taking, 11th year of marriage.

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
 We're going to Mexico, and we planned this trip.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
 If we know each other at all, I love Mexico.

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,040
 It's one of my favorite places in the world, the Caribbean and Mexico.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 This is coming, so I'm just enduring. I'm running the race.

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
 I'm doing everything I can to get to that moment where I can exhale.

63
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,040
 Vacation. It's here. We go to the airport.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,040
 We fly. We land there in Cancun, and we wait a little bit for our bags.

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
 We eventually get them, go through customs, and then you kind of walk

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,040
 through this war zone of an airport where everybody's coming to you,

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,040
 trying to get you a taxi or a bus or something.

68
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,040
 We had rented a car, and I'd already paid for this.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 I take the shuttle to the rental car place, and I get there.

70
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 We have to wait, and there's this language barrier.

71
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
 That's okay because it's a foreign country, and so there should be.

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
 That just kind of makes me feel like we're where we need to be.

73
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,040
 She's charging me $130, and I'm trying to tell her I've already prepaid.

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 Look here, I prepaid through Orbitz. I've reserved this car,

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
 and this is twice as much as I actually paid.

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 She's like, "No, it's for insurance." I'm like, "I don't want insurance."

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,040
 I don't have insurance in Mexico. I think you're lying to me.

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 So we're kind of doing this, and she's like, "You need to pay for gas."

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
 I'm like, "I'll fill it up." We're having this conversation,

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,040
 and we're just going back and forth. We're not really getting anywhere,

81
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,040
 and she's kind of escalating. I'm like, "This shouldn't start this way.

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,040
 It's a vacation, so whatever. Fine. Okay. Whatever. Whatever."

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,040
 She's like, "We need to put a $700 hold on your credit card."

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,040
 I'm like, "Okay. Whatever. Okay. I'll dispute that later."

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,040
 Eventually, we wait. We get the car. We put our stuff in the car,

86
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 and we leave. I'm like, "I'm on the way. Vacation. I'm on the way."

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,040
 We get out on the road. We're trying to leave the airport,

88
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,040
 and that was really difficult because these roads are confusing,

89
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,040
 and these signs are confusing. It's like Terminal 1, Terminal 2,

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
 Terminal 3, Terminal 1, Terminal 2. I'm stuck in Groundhog Day.

91
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,040
 I'm like, "I don't know how to get out of this place."

92
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,040
 I'm trying to follow the signs to Flight O'Carmen, but it's just taking me

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,040
 on these roundabouts, and my wife's losing confidence in me.

94
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 I'm trying to get out of the airport, and then finally, finally,

95
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,040
 I'm like, "See this other road we haven't been on. Turn on it, and see a road."

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,040
 I'm like, "Okay. I'm on vacation."

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,040
 The car starts going beep, beep, beep, and flashing all these lights.

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 She's like, "What does that mean?" I'm like, "I don't know."

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 I'm like, "What does that word mean in Spanish right there on the dash?"

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 She's like, "I don't know." It's going beep, beep, beep, flashing lights.

101
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
 Beep, beep, beep, flashing lights.

102
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 Turn around, going back to the rental car. I find out what it is.

103
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,040
 It's just that the parking brake was a little bit engaged, so let that go.

104
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,040
 No big deal. No big deal. Vacation. Going to the resort.

105
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,040
 We get there. We finally get there.

106
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
 They have this private check-in, which is amazing.

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
 They're like, "Welcome." I'm like, "Yes. Here."

108
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,040
 We go, and they take us to this other room to check in, and we walk by the pool.

109
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
 Now, some of you like to relax on vacation. I'm not that person.

110
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
 I don't relax well. I like to go and do.

111
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,040
 I'm excited about playing volleyball and hanging out, swimming by the pool,

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,040
 and at the pool, and going to the beach, and doing excursions.

113
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,040
 That's what I'm thinking about.

114
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
 We walk by the pool. It's a party.

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,040
 I'm like, "Yes. Vacation."

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 We check in, and then we go and get in our room.

117
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 We put up our bags, our luggage, our clothes, and everything.

118
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:25,040
 Then we come outside, and it's pouring down rain.

119
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,040
 It doesn't stop.

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 We're like, "The sun will come out."

121
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,040
 God's like, "No, it won't. Not for five days."

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 It's not going to come out.

123
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 We didn't see it. It rained the entire time.

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,040
 Torrential downpour.

125
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 I don't know if you've ever been in this place where you're like,

126
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 "Why is life fighting me right now?

127
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
 Why is nothing going my way?"

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
 I know, #FirstWorldProblems, but here's the deal.

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 If you have this high view of the sovereignty of God, you're like,

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
 "God, why are you fighting me right now?

131
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,040
 You can make the rain go away, but you hate me.

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,040
 Why? Why are you so mad at me?

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
 Why are you crying from heaven? What's going on?"

134
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
 You start to think all these things, and you're like,

135
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,040
 "God, what is the deal? What's going on?

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,040
 I just wanted to come here. I just wanted to exhale.

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:26,040
 I wanted to relax, and even this vacation is stressful."

138
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 And so we're moving, beginning, starting this series, "Exhale Tonight."

139
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,040
 I don't know where you're at,

140
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,040
 but if it feels like life is fighting you,

141
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,040
 if it feels like God is fighting you,

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,040
 I want to show you from the text tonight that He's not.

143
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
 And specifically from Psalm 46,

144
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,040
 we're going to learn that God is in control.

145
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
 And if we've come into the family of God,

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
 He is not fighting us. He's fighting for us.

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
 And that difference, that makes all the difference in the world,

148
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
 that little change there, God's not fighting us.

149
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
 God's fighting for us.

150
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,040
 If we are in the family of God, He's fighting for us.

151
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
 That makes a tremendous difference.

152
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,040
 So I want to show you tonight how important it is to understand

153
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
 the control of God, that God is in control,

154
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
 and how understanding that can change your life.

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,040
 It changes everything. It changes the way you live,

156
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
 the way you date, the way you work,

157
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
 the way you build relationships, the way you study the Word.

158
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,040
 It changes everything, this reality that God is in control.

159
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,040
 And so through this series, Exhale, we're going to camp in the Psalms.

160
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,040
 The Psalms is essentially the Hebrew iTunes playlist.

161
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,040
 The Psalms is like what a young Jewish man before Christ would have had on his iPod.

162
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 These are actual songs that people wrote.

163
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
 A lot of them David wrote.

164
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
 We're going to be in one tonight that the sons of Korah wrote.

165
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,040
 Sons of Korah are responsible for about 25 of the Psalms.

166
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
 And specifically Psalm 46, if you want to turn there,

167
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
 where we're going to be tonight.

168
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:10,040
 And we're going to look at God's protection, God's power, and God's peace.

169
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,040
 And this message tonight may cause some real stress for some of you.

170
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,040
 You're like, "Wow, that's really counterintuitive, Exhale series."

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 But I hope if you're here and you're in the family of God,

172
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:31,040
 it brings a deep, deep abiding, sustaining sense of peace for you.

173
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,040
 The goal tonight is that you would leave here and just see how awesome God is in this Psalm.

174
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,040
 This is a Psalm that President Obama read on the 10-year anniversary of September 11.

175
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,040
 This is a Psalm that influenced Martin Luther's "A Mighty Fortress is Our God."

176
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,040
 And this is a Psalm that influenced the "Shane and Shane" song we just sang or touched on,

177
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
 "Lord of Hosts," Psalm 46 from their new album.

178
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:08,040
 And the sons of Korah, they were basically a group, a music group for God's people at this time.

179
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,040
 They were essentially the Shane and Shane of 700 years before Christ.

180
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,040
 That's who wrote this Psalm, and so it's an actual song.

181
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
 And the context that it was written in is there's this king, Hezekiah.

182
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
 He's the king of Judah.

183
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
 And so he's there in Jerusalem.

184
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,040
 He's the king of Judah, and there's these terrible people, the Assyrians, the Assyrian army.

185
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
 And they're coming in.

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,040
 They're led by this guy, Sennacherib.

187
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
 Oh, man, I messed that up.

188
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
 I'm sorry.

189
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
 Sennacherib.

190
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
 There we go.

191
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 Led by this guy, Sennacherib.

192
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,040
 And so he's just an awful guy.

193
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
 And so let me just tell you how awful.

194
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
 Think ISIS, all right?

195
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
 So think that you're there.

196
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,040
 You're on this side of the wall, and ISIS, they're conquering the world, and they're coming for you inside the wall.

197
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,040
 And what they're really good at, what these guys are pros at, is skinning people, skinning humans.

198
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 That's who's waiting on the other side of the wall for you.

199
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
 Can you imagine?

200
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
 So I don't know what kind of stress you're in right now.

201
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,040
 I don't know what kind of battles you're facing, but you're sitting on this side of the wall, and the enemies are out there saying, "Hey, we're coming for you, man.

202
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
 Everybody ready?

203
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
 You ready?

204
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
 We're going to conquer them.

205
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
 We'll skin them."

206
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,040
 And you're just like, Hezekiah's inside, like, "Oh, man, God, what do we do?

207
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
 What do we do?"

208
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:29,040
 And this psalm was most likely written as a battle cry and really a victory cry for that situation right there.

209
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
 Let's dive in.

210
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 Verse 1.

211
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
 "God is our refuge and our strength and ever-present help in trouble.

212
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth gives way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging."

213
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:54,040
 And then what you might have in your scripture there is the word "selah," which is just like a exhale, a rest, relax.

214
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,040
 And so my first point this evening is the protection of God is ever-present.

215
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,040
 He is our refuge and strength and ever-present help in trouble, verse 1 says.

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,040
 The protection of God is ever-present.

217
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 Let me ask you, what do you turn to in times of trouble?

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,040
 When you face trouble, is it your first reaction to stop and say, "Okay, God, I know your control of everything.

219
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:33,040
 I know you're protecting me right now, protecting me at work, protecting me from this persecution, protecting me from -- in the midst of this heartbreak, you're with me, God."

220
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,040
 You're who I want to turn to first, God.

221
00:13:38,040 --> 00:14:00,040
 He says, "When the earth gives way, have you ever felt like the world around you was falling apart, that relationships end out of the blue, that a job turns south, a family member gets sick, you get in a wreck, your car breaks down, it just seems that everything around you is falling apart, it seems that life is fighting you."

222
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
 What are you grasping for in that time? That will really define your faith.

223
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 That will really define what you believe, is that when everything is falling apart, what are you grasping for?

224
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,040
 What are the constants? What are the things that will hold you up?

225
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,040
 God is our refuge.

226
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,040
 That word just means literally shelter from danger.

227
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,040
 He's a shelter we cling to or run to in danger, and not just our refuge but also our strength.

228
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
 Ever-present help.

229
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:47,040
 We were -- this summer, my family and I were driving back from family camp in Missouri, and we were driving through these towns that had been torn apart by tornadoes, Joplin, Missouri, and outside Moore, Oklahoma.

230
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,040
 And I don't know if you remember this, but the weather was really bad on this particular day.

231
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
 And I weigh these words so carefully, what I'm about to tell you.

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
 I don't want to exaggerate.

233
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,040
 It was the single worst weather I have ever driven in.

234
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,040
 And so it's raining, torrential downpour.

235
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,040
 There's winds that are blowing my wife's Suburban, like back and forth on the road.

236
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 I feel them.

237
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
 It's torrential downpour.

238
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,040
 It's like someone has a fire hose, like just pointed at our windshield.

239
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
 Zero visibility.

240
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,040
 I can't see the little concrete wall right beside me.

241
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,040
 I remember looking specifically out the driver's side window, and I can't see it.

242
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
 And there's hail.

243
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
 It's thunderous inside the car.

244
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
 You cannot hear another human being.

245
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
 It's so loud.

246
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
 And then my iPhone's going off.

247
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
 It said flash floods right now, and I'm like, oh, does that ever really happen?

248
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,040
 And then I just see a car float by.

249
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
 True story.

250
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
 I mean, there is water up to its door handles.

251
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
 And this is on the side of the road.

252
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,040
 The road's elevated, luckily.

253
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,040
 And so we're driving through this, and this is what happens.

254
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
 What I do, my response is to grip the wheel and lean forward and to look with everything I can.

255
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
 It's kind of like, okay, I'm in control.

256
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,040
 My wife's response is, hey, I think you need to pull over.

257
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
 I think you should pull over.

258
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
 Let's wait this one out.

259
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,040
 And so she's strategizing around what she thinks needs to happen.

260
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 Okay.

261
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
 My son Weston, he has a night-night.

262
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
 That's code for a blanket.

263
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
 And he kind of covers his head.

264
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
 You know, I'm like, oh, we're going the ostrich strategy here.

265
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
 We're going to wait.

266
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
 It doesn't go away, Weston.

267
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
 And so he's sucking his thumb, covering his head.

268
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
 He's going towards comfort.

269
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,040
 And then Finley's in the back, and she is going hysterical.

270
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
 She's our kind of drama queen, if you will.

271
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,040
 And she is just screaming, crying, hyperventilating in the back, terrified.

272
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,040
 She's trusting her fears.

273
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
 And then there's my 8-year-old Presley.

274
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,040
 And she's like, guys, guys, guys, listen.

275
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 Everybody listen to me.

276
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
 I'm like, okay, I'm listening.

277
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
 She's got a plan.

278
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,040
 She goes, we need to pray.

279
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
 And I'm like, man, she's right.

280
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,040
 Like, Presley just knows who controls the tornadoes, the flash flooding, the rain, the winds.

281
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,040
 The winds and waves obey him.

282
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
 And she knows that.

283
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,040
 And she's like, hey, you gripping the wheel, you saying to pull over, you crying,

284
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 and you covering your face with your night-night, that ain't going to help.

285
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,040
 We need to pray.

286
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
 So we prayed.

287
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:26,040
 She said, hey, this is where we need to go to the God who controls the world, the earth, and everything in it.

288
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,040
 He's our protector, and his protection is ever-present.

289
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
 It's always available.

290
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
 Let's turn to him.

291
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
 Verse 4.

292
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,040
 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.

293
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 God is within her.

294
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
 She will not fall.

295
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,040
 God will help her at break of day.

296
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
 Let me just pause there for a second and say this.

297
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 Hezekiah is memorialized today for this thing called Hezekiah's tunnels.

298
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
 If you go to Jerusalem, you can still see them.

299
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
 I think we have a picture.

300
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,040
 And so these are these tunnels of water that move through Jerusalem.

301
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 And so what he did is when Sennacherib came to the city is he closed off the springs and the other rivers.

302
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 He dried up the water sources.

303
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 And they still had water in the city because of these tunnels that he had dug.

304
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:25,040
 And so when we know that and we read this in a new light, there's a river whose streams make glad the city of God.

305
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
 Verse 6.

306
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,040
 Nations are in an uproar.

307
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
 Kingdoms fall.

308
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
 He lifts his voice.

309
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
 The earth melts.

310
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
 The Lord Almighty is with us.

311
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
 The God of Jacob.

312
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
 He is our fortress.

313
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,040
 He's saying God is powerful.

314
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,040
 His voice melts the earth, the very earth that he spoke into existence.

315
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,040
 He can now destroy it with his voice, with his words.

316
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,040
 And so it's not enough that God is ever-present protector.

317
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,040
 He's also powerful.

318
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
 You understand why that's important?

319
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:05,040
 Because if I've got an ever-present protector, like let's just say I've got a bodyguard walking around with me, but he's a little guy and he doesn't even know karate.

320
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,040
 You're like, that's cool that you've got this ever-present protector, but I'm not very intimidated by him.

321
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 God's an ever-present protector who's all-powerful.

322
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
 All power is his.

323
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,040
 He can do anything that you can imagine, anything that you can fathom.

324
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,040
 That's my second point this evening is the power of God prevails.

325
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 The power of God prevails.

326
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 It says he's almighty, the Lord Almighty.

327
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
 I looked that up and it says in the dictionary, there's two definitions for it.

328
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,040
 One is having complete power and two is a name for God.

329
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,040
 He's almighty. He has complete power.

330
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
 And he's not just a refuge like we looked in that first section.

331
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
 He's also a fortress.

332
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:57,040
 A refuge is a place for shelter, but a fortress is a fortified place full of soldiers, full of warriors.

333
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,040
 And why I tell you that, because the Hebrew word for almighty there is Jehovah Sabbath.

334
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:11,040
 The Lord Almighty Jehovah Sabbath, which actually literally translates the Lord of hosts.

335
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
 Maybe your Bible actually says the Lord of hosts.

336
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
 What does that mean?

337
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,040
 He's the God of angel armies.

338
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
 He's the commanding officer of an army of angels.

339
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
 Now why is this important?

340
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 Anytime you see angels in the scripture, you know what it's usually followed by?

341
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 Get up.

342
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
 If an angel shows up, usually the first words they say is get up off the ground.

343
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,040
 Why? Because someone sees them and they're terrified and they fall to the ground in fear.

344
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,040
 These guys are amazing supernatural warriors.

345
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 Right?

346
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,040
 And so God is the commanding officer of these supernatural warriors.

347
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 And so what happens in the dialogue, in the narrative, is Sennacherib is outside the city.

348
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 And he's saying, hey, we're going to skin you.

349
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:08,040
 And really what he says literally in the scripture, he says, I hope you don't think your God's going to protect you.

350
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 Every other nation we've defeated thought their God was going to protect them.

351
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
 Your God can't stop us.

352
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,040
 And then he turns to the people that Hezekiah is leading.

353
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:26,040
 This is 2 Kings 18 and 19 and 2 Chronicles chapter 32 if you want to write it in your Bibles there.

354
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 He turns to the people that Hezekiah is leading.

355
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:36,040
 He speaks to them through the walls and he says, if he's told you that his God is going to protect you, he's wrong.

356
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,040
 Your God can't protect you.

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
 Can you imagine being on this side of the wall?

358
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,040
 And your faith becomes real at this point.

359
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
 Like do I really believe in this God?

360
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 I mean these guys are going to skin us.

361
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,040
 Do I really believe in this God?

362
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 And so Hezekiah goes into the temple.

363
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
 He says, God, what do I do?

364
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
 They're going to kill us.

365
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
 They're waiting outside the wall.

366
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
 What do I do?

367
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,040
 And the prophet Isaiah comes and says, do not fear.

368
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 The Lord is with you.

369
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
 He's going to deliver you from the hands of your enemy.

370
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,040
 In fact, he's going to send him home to his homeland Nineveh.

371
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
 Don't be afraid.

372
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,040
 And do you know what happens that night?

373
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:26,040
 The angel of the Lord moves through Sennacherib's army and kills 185,000 men.

374
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 They wake up the next day and the army is dead.

375
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 185,000 men slayed at the sword of the angel of the Lord.

376
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:43,040
 One angel, God is the commanding chief of an army, an army of angels.

377
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,040
 One of them he sends to slay 185,000 men.

378
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
 This is history.

379
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 Those tunnels, they're still there.

380
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
 You can go see them today.

381
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,040
 The tunnels that this king Hezekiah dug.

382
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 It's history.

383
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,040
 And so how do you battle?

384
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,040
 How do you feel distressed as you turn to your own power, your own control?

385
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,040
 Is that why you're checking your bank account every day?

386
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,040
 I know for some of you that's a really sad moment.

387
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,040
 But for others of you, you're trying to build up confidence.

388
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
 I'm going to be okay.

389
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,040
 No matter what, if I get laid off, I'm going to be okay for a few months.

390
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
 Get in the gym.

391
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
 Build up your strength.

392
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,040
 I'm going to build security, building relationships, counting friends on social media.

393
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 Whatever I've got to do to feel secure and comfort and safe.

394
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,040
 People who have the most stuff don't have the most peace.

395
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,040
 People who have the most faith have the most peace.

396
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
 People who have the most things don't have the most peace.

397
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:02,040
 People who have the most faith, people who have the most God have the most peace.

398
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
 Have you ever met these people?

399
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
 They seem delusional.

400
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
 Whatever life throws at them, it's like, "Hey, I've got cancer."

401
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
 "What? That's terrible."

402
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,040
 "No, it's just an incredible opportunity to share the gospel in the hospital."

403
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,040
 "What is wrong with you? Who thinks that way?"

404
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
 Listen, I'm not trying to make light of cancer.

405
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
 I know these people personally.

406
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
 I talk to them.

407
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,040
 I'm like, "Man, you have so much faith in God.

408
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,040
 You kind of seem out of your mind.

409
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,040
 I don't even trust you. You have that much faith.

410
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:36,040
 But okay, I love the way you trust God, but I also want that for myself."

411
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,040
 I wish I moved through life and I held it so loosely.

412
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,040
 Whatever happens to you, it's like, "God is in control.

413
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,040
 Who shall I fear?

414
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,040
 The God, the creator of the heavens and the earth is with me.

415
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
 He's in control. I'm going to be with Him soon."

416
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,040
 What difference does this make?

417
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,040
 Our things, our stuff, it just gives us the illusion of control.

418
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,040
 Your stuff doesn't give you control.

419
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
 Have you ever seen someone and you're like, "Oh, man, they've got so much stuff.

420
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
 He must have a complete piece."

421
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 Let me show you, in fact, a house.

422
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 Let me show you a palace of someone.

423
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
 A pretty incredible house.

424
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
 I've seen it, actually.

425
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,040
 That is the palace of a prince, a president, if you will, a ruler, a controller.

426
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
 That's where he lives.

427
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,040
 It's not the White House, in case you haven't seen the White House.

428
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
 That's not it.

429
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,040
 It is an incredible, incredible place where a king, a president lives.

430
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,040
 You must look at that place and think, "Wow, how much peace does that guy have?"

431
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,040
 He's got all kinds of stuff at his disposal.

432
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
 He can do anything.

433
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
 He is in absolute control.

434
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
 He's sovereign.

435
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 I went and saw that house.

436
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
 I went and saw that palace.

437
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
 Let me show it to you.

438
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
 That's what I saw.

439
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,040
 I went and saw it in 2010, right after the earthquake hit Haiti.

440
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,040
 Port-au-Prince, that's Port-au-Prince Palace, was the epicenter of the earthquake.

441
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
 It had been shaken to pieces.

442
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
 In fact, the whole second floor has collapsed there.

443
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 Those four pillars that sat in the front, making it feel so strong and safe, they're gone.

444
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
 They turned to dust right there.

445
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,040
 It's interesting because in Haiti, they worship Satan.

446
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,040
 Literally, their president dedicated the nation to Satan.

447
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 Through voodoo, they worship Satan.

448
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,040
 When this happened, the whole country returned to God.

449
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
 You know what they said?

450
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 They told me this.

451
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
 I heard this.

452
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,040
 They said, "Satan can't shake the world like that.

453
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,040
 We know there's a God.

454
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,040
 We know there's a God."

455
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
 So he used the earthquake for good.

456
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
 He woke up a nation.

457
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:56,040
 The sovereign of that nation's home was shaken to rubbles, to pieces, to dust.

458
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,040
 So come and see what the Lord has done, the desolations he has brought on the earth.

459
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,040
 Come and see the piles of dead men, 185,000 that came against our God.

460
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,040
 Come and see them.

461
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
 Wake up.

462
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
 They're out there.

463
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,040
 The Lord has shown his faithfulness.

464
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
 He's shown his face to us.

465
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth.

466
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,040
 He breaks the bow and shatters the spear.

467
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
 He burns the shields with fire.

468
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,040
 He says, "Be still, be still, and know that I am God.

469
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
 I will be exalted among the nations.

470
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
 I will be exalted in the earth.

471
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
 The Lord Almighty is with us.

472
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 The God of Jacob is our fortress."

473
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,040
 So let's just look at his abilities real quick.

474
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,040
 He scorches the earth with his words.

475
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:54,040
 He breaks the tools that we use to fight people, to break things.

476
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,040
 He melts the best military technology of the time with fire.

477
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,040
 And he makes wars cease, bringing peace.

478
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,040
 I want you to know there's two ways to bring peace in a human being.

479
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,040
 There's two ways to bring peace in a land.

480
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,040
 You can change the hearts of the men and women of that land and bring peace,

481
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 or you can destroy the men and women of that land who are not about peace.

482
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
 Do you see that? Let me say that again.

483
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
 There's two ways to bring peace in a land.

484
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,040
 You can take the evil hearts of people, the hearts of unrest of people,

485
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
 and you can change them for good,

486
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,040
 or you can take the evil hearts of people and destroy those people

487
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 so that all that's left there is peace.

488
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,040
 God does both, and this text is talking about the second one.

489
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
 Do you understand that?

490
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,040
 That everyone here will experience a peace one way or another.

491
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,040
 Either God will change your heart to where you become a follower of Christ

492
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
 and there's peace in your life because you're following Christ,

493
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 or one day, if we have not trusted in Christ,

494
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,040
 He will destroy those whose hearts are wicked, whose hearts are not His,

495
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:17,040
 and bring about peace in the land as heaven comes here to the earth.

496
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,040
 And so my third and final point is God's protection and power gives peace to His people.

497
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 God's protection and power gives peace to His people.

498
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,040
 This is a really simple math equation for you.

499
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,040
 It's God's protection plus God's power equals your peace.

500
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,040
 This God who loves you is protecting you.

501
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
 He is all-powerful.

502
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:46,040
 What do you have to worry about?

503
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,040
 Exhale.

504
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 Exhale and know that He is God.

505
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,040
 I know that life is like a conveyor belt.

506
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,040
 It's going backwards.

507
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,040
 If you're not marching forward with every step you can, fighting to get to the top,

508
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
 you're going backwards.

509
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,040
 If you sit still, you're moving backwards.

510
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 You're digressing.

511
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
 I know it feels like that.

512
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,040
 In fact, if you will, let's just do this, a participatory illustration.

513
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 If you will, grip your hands as tight as you can.

514
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
 Clench your body.

515
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
 Right now, grab your hands.

516
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
 Make a fist, the tightest fist you can.

517
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
 Let me see that some of you aren't trying.

518
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
 Tightest fist you can, both hands.

519
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
 Come on.

520
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
 Tightest fist.

521
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
 You hold on.

522
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
 It's like you woke up and the alarm clock came on late

523
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
 and you get to your car and it doesn't have power.

524
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 The battery's dead.

525
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
 And you drive to work and you're late for the meeting

526
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
 and everything's falling apart.

527
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 And you're like, "Okay, but I'm a Christian.

528
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
 But I'm--ah!

529
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 And I've got to control and I've got to get to promotion

530
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
 and I've got to fight them."

531
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 And we just take a deep breath and exhale.

532
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,040
 And say, "He is God."

533
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,040
 That was so lame, man.

534
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 And say, "He is God."

535
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
 Okay, guys, one more time.

536
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,040
 And say, "He is God."

537
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
 Indeed He is.

538
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
 And you are not.

539
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 You're a miserable God.

540
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,040
 You're not in control of anything.

541
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,040
 Not anything.

542
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,040
 But He's in control.

543
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,040
 God knew what I needed on vacation.

544
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
 Just like He was saying, "Oh, you want to go and do?

545
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,040
 No, bro, you've got to stop.

546
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
 I want you to be still."

547
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
 And in fact, I control the weather.

548
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
 We had an amazing vacation.

549
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
 Incredible.

550
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
 Because we rested.

551
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
 We say a lot.

552
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
 We exhaled.

553
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040
 We were still and reminded that He is God,

554
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,040
 the God of the weather.

555
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:51,040
 That storm that we were in turned into Hurricane Patricia,

556
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
 which has done some damage to Mexico,

557
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
 if you watch the news at all.

558
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
 And it raises the question for me,

559
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
 as we sat there over the ocean,

560
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
 and I've read an article about this

561
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
 and heard a message about it once.

562
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,040
 What happens to the fish in the midst of a hurricane?

563
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,040
 I mean, when the water and everything is being stirred up

564
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 and there's so much turbulence,

565
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
 these fish that swim at the surface of the ocean,

566
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,040
 what happens to them when there's such a huge storm

567
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
 that can lift a house and throw it miles away?

568
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,040
 What happens to the fish?

569
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
 And so I read about them,

570
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,040
 and what these fish do is they go deep, deep, deep into the ocean.

571
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,040
 They sense the storm because the pressure changes,

572
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
 and they go deep, deep, deep into the ocean

573
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,040
 where they're not disturbed by the turbulence.

574
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
 They're not disturbed by the storms above.

575
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
 Here's what that means.

576
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,040
 There's a place where the fish can go,

577
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,040
 where the turbulence around them and the storm around them,

578
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
 they cannot even be felt by them.

579
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,040
 And what this text is saying is there's a place where Christians go,

580
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
 followers of Christ go,

581
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,040
 deep, deep, deep into their relationship with God

582
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,040
 where the storms of life and the turbulence around them,

583
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,040
 they are not affected by it.

584
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,040
 They sit in the peace of God.

585
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,040
 This is why Paul writes in Philippians 4,

586
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,040
 "Do not be anxious about anything,

587
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,040
 "but in everything by prayer and petition

588
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,040
 "present your request to God with thanksgiving."

589
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,040
 And the peace of God which transcends,

590
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,040
 a peace of God that no one can fathom or even understand,

591
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
 the peace of God himself,

592
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
 sovereign creator of the universe,

593
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:44,040
 will protect your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

594
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,040
 And here's our application this evening.

595
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,040
 And to trust that God is in control, that he's powerful,

596
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
 that he protects us.

597
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,040
 And because he loves us, he's for us, we have peace.

598
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,040
 And when trouble comes, our first reaction is to go deep, deep, deep

599
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
 into relationship with him.

600
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 It's an intuitive reaction.

601
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,040
 It's not a worldly reaction.

602
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,040
 It's the reaction of his followers.

603
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
 So don't lean on your control.

604
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 Find peace in his control.

605
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,040
 Do not lean on your control,

606
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,040
 but find peace in God's control.

607
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 If you are here and you are not in sin,

608
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 actively sinning,

609
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 you are not fighting against God.

610
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
 He's fighting for you.

611
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
 He's fighting for you, the Lord of hosts,

612
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
 the God of angel armies.

613
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,040
 Can I just tell you something really amazing?

614
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,040
 Outside the very walls that Sennacherib and his army stood,

615
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,040
 where an angel of the Lord slayed 185,000 of them,

616
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
 another man was slayed.

617
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
 The same place, the same city.

618
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,040
 Hundreds of feet from where this took place.

619
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,040
 Jesus was slayed.

620
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,040
 God allowed his own son to be killed for you,

621
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
 for your sins.

622
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,040
 He paid the price for everything wrong you've done

623
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,040
 to bring about peace in your relationship with the Lord of hosts,

624
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,040
 the most powerful force in the universe.

625
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,040
 You have peace with him, the scripture says,

626
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,040
 if you have trusted that his son, Jesus Christ,

627
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:32,040
 was slayed, killed on your behalf for you.

628
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,040
 In the same place where this took place.

629
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,040
 700 years before this, men wrote this song celebrating victory.

630
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,040
 Today, in a moment, we're going to sing a song

631
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,040
 celebrating the victory we have in Jesus Christ

632
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,040
 because of what God has done for us through him.

633
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 We get to be with God forever and ever and ever.

634
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,040
 We sit still in this reality.

635
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:03,040
 In summary, God's protection, it's ever present.

636
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,040
 God's power, it always prevails.

637
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 His protection and his power leads to our peace.

638
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,040
 As I wrap up, let me just throw this disclaimer on this story.

639
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
 I was not a Christian in college.

640
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,040
 I'm a Christian in college.

641
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,040
 Sometimes I tell stories that are descriptive, not prescriptive.

642
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
 This is definitely one of those.

643
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
 You don't want to relive this story for yourself.

644
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
 I wouldn't relive it today.

645
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 I was at this party and we were pitching washers.

646
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
 Do you guys know what that means?

647
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
 You throw these little round things into holes in the ground.

648
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
 You follow me? Pitching washers.

649
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
 Okay, we're there.

650
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 That was the extent of my athletic experience in college, pitching washers.

651
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 I'm pitching washers and this guy comes up to the party

652
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
 clearly drunk.

653
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
 He's a big guy.

654
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
 A huge, huge, huge beast of a man.

655
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,040
 He walks in front of me and I truly innocently throw this washer and it hits him in the side.

656
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
 No big deal.

657
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
 It's like getting hit with a quarter tossed underhand.

658
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 No big deal.

659
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,040
 He turns to me, big deal, and says, "You better watch where you're throwing that."

660
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
 Explicative.

661
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
 I kind of smile.

662
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 I'm like, "Oh, my bad."

663
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,040
 Now he comes up to me quickly, is chest to chest with me, and says,

664
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,040
 "Do you think something's funny?"

665
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,040
 I'm like, "No."

666
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
 See, here's what's going on.

667
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
 This guy was bored.

668
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,040
 He's drunk. He's bored.

669
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
 He's looking for a fight.

670
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
 He's a tall, skinny guy.

671
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
 These guys always go after the tall guy so they can say they accomplished something.

672
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,040
 But little dude, I'm tall, skinny, scrawny guy, and gangly dude.

673
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,040
 He goes up to Gumby and he's like, "I'm going to kill you."

674
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
 I'm like, "I don't really want to be killed tonight.

675
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
 That's not really what I'm looking for."

676
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,040
 He's there and he's like, "Do you think something's funny?"

677
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,040
 Here's what happened unbeknownst to him.

678
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
 My boys were there.

679
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,040
 In college, I ran with some thugs.

680
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,040
 They're hitting each other.

681
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
 One of them touches--hey, JP's in trouble.

682
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
 They turn around.

683
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
 They stop whatever shenanigans they were doing.

684
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,040
 They circle us.

685
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,040
 It's just him and his buddy, little buddy, his workout partner or whatever.

686
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
 It's him.

687
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,040
 Now he's surrounded by eight or nine of my boys.

688
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 He asked me again, "Do you think something's funny?"

689
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:47,040
 I kind of look around, kind of survey the land, if you will.

690
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,040
 I'm like, "Now that you mentioned it, I kind of think it's hilarious."

691
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
 Here's what I'm thinking.

692
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,040
 Whatever he's going to do to me, he's not going to do it for very long.

693
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
 See, I was the scrawny one.

694
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
 My boys weren't scrawny.

695
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
 No, they love the weight room.

696
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
 They were big dudes.

697
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
 There they are, circled us.

698
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
 He didn't know.

699
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
 He trusted in his ability.

700
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 He trusted in his own strength.

701
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,040
 He didn't see what was really happening.

702
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,040
 I'm sitting there, and I'm like, "Hey, whatever I'm about to endure from this guy,

703
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
 it's not going to last very long."

704
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,040
 That's the truth of whatever you're in right now.

705
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
 If you've trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,

706
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
 whatever you're enduring right now, I just want to say,

707
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,040
 relatively speaking compared to billions and billions and billions of eternity,

708
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,040
 it's not going to last very long.

709
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,040
 Because the Lord of hosts is with you.

710
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,040
 And some of you, you're here, and you're trusting in your abilities.

711
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 You've surveyed the land, and you have tragically underestimated our God,

712
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
 the creator of the heavens and the earth.

713
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,040
 And he's going to bring you to a place of surrender, and he's going to do it, I hope.

714
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,040
 I pray out of an act of love to you, because every knee will bow.

715
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:13,040
 Either willingly, God, you're God, or by force, God, you're God.

716
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 And every tongue will confess.

717
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:24,040
 And the scriptures are full of stories who underestimated people who underestimated God.

718
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:31,040
 I mean these God's people having victory in the most unassuming of circumstances.

719
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
 When everyone looks at them and says,

720
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,040
 "Certainly this little boy is going to be defeated by this giant.

721
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,040
 Certainly there's no way this group of armies are going to get into the walls of Jericho.

722
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,040
 Certainly there's no way we can make it through this sea when Pharaoh's army is coming.

723
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
 Certainly there's no way we can be victorious."

724
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,040
 And God says, "You don't see what I'm doing.

725
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 I'm the Lord of hosts, and I'm with you in battle."

726
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:05,040
 One of my favorites is in 2 Kings 6, it's Elisha.

727
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 And the Arameans are coming after him, and these are also amazingly powerful people.

728
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,040
 And in fact, his servant sees them.

729
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,040
 And so his servant runs in and says, "Elisha, Elisha, the Arameans,

730
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,040
 they've lined the horizon there with horses and chariots.

731
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
 They've come after us."

732
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,040
 And Elisha says this, "Don't be afraid."

733
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:39,040
 The prophet answered, "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."

734
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,040
 And Elisha, the scripture says, Elisha prayed that his servant's eyes would be opened

735
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 and that he would see.

736
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:55,040
 And just then the servant lifted his head and saw Elisha surrounded by an army of hosts,

737
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,040
 an army of angels whose chariots were on fire.

738
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
 He saw the Lord's army.

739
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,040
 There's a battle going around you right now that you are unaware of.

740
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,040
 And if you are on God's team, he is fighting for you.

741
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,040
 Be still and know that he is God.

742
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
 Serve him courageously.

743
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,040
 Do everything you can.

744
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
 God has your back.

745
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,040
 Let me pray to that God right now.

746
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:38,040
 Father, we acknowledge you as the one true God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

747
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,040
 the same God that allowed Hezekiah victory over the Assyrians,

748
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,040
 the same God that allowed Elisha victory over the Arameans,

749
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,040
 the same God that allowed Joshua victory time and time again,

750
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,040
 the same God that allowed David victory over the Philistines.

751
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:05,040
 Now you are with us, in us, fighting for us.

752
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 God, help us not to fight you.

753
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,040
 Your scripture says that you oppose the proud but give grace to the humble.

754
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,040
 Father, would you find us humble in spirit, not fighting you in our pursuit of pleasures and sin,

755
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:29,040
 but surrendering to you fully in your finished work on the cross.

756
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,040
 In Jesus' name, amen.

757
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:42,040
 Imagine that they sung this psalm, Psalm 46, inside the walls as 185,000 men lied strewn throughout the field.

758
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 An angel of the Lord killed them all in protecting and preserving God's people.

759
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:55,040
 And in the same way, Jesus Christ through you has slayed evil on your behalf

760
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,040
 so that you might courageously walk with him, not getting caught up in the worries of this world,

761
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:04,040
 but living a life in radical surrender to God,

762
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,040
 in reckless abandonment to his Holy Spirit at work within you.

763
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040
 So stand on your feet, get on your feet right now.

764
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,040
 Raise up, army of God, raise up to your feet.

765
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:22,040
 And as we sing this song, you picture Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem

766
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:29,040
 as they sang from a position of victory, knowing the work that God has done.

767
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,040
 The Lord of hosts, let's go.

768
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,040
 Sometimes in ministry you have to look at somebody in the face and just remind them how much God loves them.

769
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:47,040
 That God, this being, this creator, that he loves them tremendously, like so much.

770
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:54,040
 He showed it on the cross. He wanted to be in a relationship with you so badly.

771
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,040
 He allowed his son to die so that you could be in relationship with him.

772
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
 And so many of you need to hear that tonight.

773
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,040
 It's like God puts his hands on your face and he pulls you near and he says, "I love you."

774
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,040
 Your life really matters.

775
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,040
 I've got plans for you.

776
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:20,040
 But my sense tonight, if I'm just being obedient, I hope,

777
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:27,040
 is that some of you need to hear you matter a whole lot less than you think you do.

778
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,040
 And I know that contradicts everything I just said, so stay with me.

779
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,040
 Your life is expendable.

780
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:40,040
 You're like your great-great-grandfather whose name you don't even know because to dust he's returned.

781
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
 You're fighting the wrong battle.

782
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,040
 You're in the world and you think, "I've got to make a name for myself. I've got to be big."

783
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,040
 And your life is marked by anxiety and worry and you think you're in control and you don't control anything.

784
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,040
 It's an illusion.

785
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,040
 The God who shakes the earth, he's in control.

786
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
 You're not in control.

787
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,040
 You're not in control.

788
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:12,040
 And some of you, that may startle you and I hope it moves you to a place of,

789
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,040
 "I'm not in control. I'm not in control. I'm not in control."

790
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,040
 God, you're in control. I'm not in control. You're in control.

791
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,040
 And the goofy guy up there told me you love me.

792
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
 And that's good news.

793
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,040
 He said, "I can be with you forever.

794
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,040
 And my job won't matter when I'm with you forever.

795
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,040
 My broken heart won't matter when I'm with you forever.

796
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,040
 What I don't have or have in the bank account won't matter when I'm with you forever.

797
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:46,040
 All that will matter when I'm with you forever is what did I do with you here in my few moments,

798
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,040
 my few seconds.

799
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,040
 It doesn't matter who knew me,

800
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,040
 if I was famous, if I made a name for myself.

801
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,040
 It's like, "What did I do for you?

802
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,040
 What did I trust in?

803
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,040
 How did I walk by faith in your promises?"

804
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
 You're the Lord of hosts.

805
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,040
 And if you want to hear more about that, you want a dialogue about that,

806
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,040
 if you're just real angry right now, I'd love to talk to you.

807
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,040
 I love talking to angry people. I'll be up here with some friends.

808
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,040
 And we'd love to pray for you.

809
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,040
 If you're looking for community, there's guys who walk down this hallway,

810
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,040
 there's a room in there of guys who are willing to talk with you about community,

811
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,040
 what it looks like, other guys who just say, "Man, I'd love to get to know you."

812
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,040
 Girls, you walk down this hallway over here, and there's a room right outside those doors

813
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,040
 that just say, "Hey, I'm glad you're here. If you're here for the first time, it'd be great to check out."

814
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,040
 Just say, "Man, what is community? What does that even mean?"

815
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,040
 And we'd love to talk with you more about that.

816
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,040
 Check out the Psalms 2 album. That song is on it.

817
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,040
 It's not even my favorite one on the album. I'll give you that insight.

818
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,040
 It's one of my favorites, but it's not my favorite. It's an amazing album.

819
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,040
 I love you guys more than you could ever know or imagine.

820
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,040
 I look out there, and I just see hope.

821
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:13,040
 Honestly, I look out there, I see your faces. I see me, frankly.

822
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:19,040
 10, 15 years ago, I just know God wants to use you to change the world.

823
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,040
 And I know your city wants to exploit you.

824
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,040
 I know the enemy is after you, and he wants to smash you into nothingness.

825
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,040
 That sometimes looks like a suburban house and a white picket fence and a German shepherd.

826
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,040
 Don't fall for that trick, man.

827
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
