[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   All right, well tonight we are starting a new series,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Quarter Life Crisis.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   What is a quarter life crisis?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   When we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   It's miserable and magical, this thing.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Going through this quarter life crisis.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I just thought I'd start, maybe kind of our team put together a list.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hey, how do you know if you're having a quarter life crisis?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And so I would say, you know, if you recently bought a juicer,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and you're eating lots of kale, and you don't know what it is,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   you might be having a quarter life crisis, right?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   If you have bought a pet for companionship, and to show your parents you're responsible,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   you might be having a quarter life crisis.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   If you have a self-diagnosed gluten allergy,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   you might be having a quarter life crisis, right?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   If you've started blogging, like you look at your life and it's like,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   "My life is so boring, but the entire world should know what I'm doing."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You might be having a quarter life crisis.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   If you are OCD, but it's the new OCD, okay, wait for it.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's obsessive comparison disorder.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   This is where you stay up all night looking at your frenemies,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Facebook and Instagram, right?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   And you're going to that album, "My Life is So Much Better Than Yours,"
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and you stay up all night looking at their pictures, and you're like,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   "Why are they always in Tahiti? How come I'm never in Tahiti?"
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   In fact, if you're always planning a vacation, you might be having a quarter life crisis.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   If you're constantly on Travelzoo or Expedia thinking, "Man, I've got to get out of here,"
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   you might be having a quarter life crisis.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   If you start thinking all the time, "You know what?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Maybe I just need to go back to school.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Like this career--you know, that's what the solution is to all my problems.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Now, I don't know what I want to go to school for, but I think I just need to go.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Maybe I'll go to grad school, or I'll go get a different degree.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I'll try a different track."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   You might be having a quarter life crisis.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And if you think the solution to all of your problems is a new job,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   you know what? "Man, I just need a new job.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I need a new job. You know what I need?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Here's the deal is I really thought I was at school, I was at college,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I got that diploma, I worked hard, and now I'm going to make a big splash
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   into corporate America, and I've landed here."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And it's like, "This is it? This can't be it.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   There's got to be something else."
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And then they started hitting a little closer to home, right?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   If you think, "Man, I just need a new job."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   That's what we're going to talk about this evening as we kick off this series,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   is when life takes us a different direction than we expected.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   In fact, that is what I believe a quarter life crisis is.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   What is it? It's when you thought that you were going one way,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and life takes you a separate way.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Let me tell you one of my favorite stories about my kids.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I have two little girls and a baby boy, Weston.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   One of my favorite stories of Presley and Finley when they were a toddler
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   was when we would go to the store.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   When they would go to the store with Daddy, I would usually take one of them.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Finley, in this case, I'll take Finley to the store,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and we'll get in that shopping cart, the one with the car on the front.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Do you guys know that one? Yeah. There it is if you don't know.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   There we are, hanging out at the grocery store, having fun.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   That's how we roll.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   We're there. I'll put Finley in that front car.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   When they were toddlers, so when they were a little younger than that,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   what we would do was this fun game.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   They would get in there, and I would push that cart, and I would watch them.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Wherever they would turn, I would go.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's funny because they're bad drivers.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They're sitting there. When you're a toddler, you don't know how to drive,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   so you just kind of jerk the wheel back and forth.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I would just do this with the cart, and then they would throw the wheel to the right,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and I would just take the cart to the right.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We'd hit the apple stands. Apples are falling.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I'd throw the cart to the left, and I'd go to the left, and we'd hit the Cheerios,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and the Cheerios would fall over.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We would just steer that thing through the grocery store.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Finley thought she was driving. She thought she was in charge.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Then every single time we did that, we would have this moment.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   This is the moment. Let me explain it to you.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   She would go right. She'd turn right, and I'd go left.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   The game was over.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I would watch a frustrated Finley grab that wheel and tightly turn it to the right.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Right with all her might. No, right. I said right.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'd just effortlessly go left.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   She learned in that moment that she wasn't in control.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   At that very point in your life, I think, is when this idea of a quarter-life crisis happens.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   When our expectations aren't met,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   maybe we had a sense of entitlement and were dealing with disappointments,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   we turned right, and for whatever reason, life took us left.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We sit there and we say, "Wait a minute. Why can't I go right?"
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   But the curtain of life just seems to keep going left.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Why?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Now you can think of a lot of scenarios.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Maybe you're singleness. Maybe you're married. Maybe you're divorced.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Maybe it's relationships.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But tonight we're talking about work.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   When you go right at work, when you steer right at work,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   but it just seems that God, who is in control, keeps taking you left.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   In this moment when you realize that you don't have nearly as much control of your life as you thought you did,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   it is in this moment that your quarter-life crisis begins.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And so maybe you think you do have a lot of control,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and you just live in fear of losing that control.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And that is the cause of your quarter-life crisis.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And so you're realizing that someone else is in control,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   and you're not happy with their pace or their direction.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And ensues this idea of a quarter-life crisis.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And so I can look at some stats on our generation in regards to jobs.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Just six in ten millennials have jobs.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Half of them are part-time jobs.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That comes from Harvard University.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Average tenure for Generation Y, that's most of us in the room, is two years.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And so for the generation before us, that was five years.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And the generation before them, that was seven years.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   So what's happening is tenure at work gets less and less.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Most of you will be at your job two years or less.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And what's interesting is we keep looking for happiness in our workplace.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   We keep trying to find purpose in our career,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   but our depression stats, our depression rate is 19%.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's the highest it's ever been of any other generation.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   We are the most depressed generation ever to live.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Why is this?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Because we keep looking for purpose in the wrong places.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And so tonight we're talking about purpose in your career.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I'm going to be in James 4.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   If you don't have your Bibles, turn with me to James 4.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   James is in the back of your Bibles.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's one of those small books towards the very end of your Bible.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Get near Revelation, and you will find James after Hebrews,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   before 1 Peter, the book of James.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   We're going to look specifically tonight.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   I'm going to ask you three questions.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   We're going to try to answer three questions from this text in James 4, starting in verse 13.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Those questions are what is the purpose of your plans?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Who is determining your direction?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   What does God have for you to do right where you are?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And so James is the brother of Jesus.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   We love Jesus. Most of us in the room love Jesus.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And how great would it be to interview someone who actually knew Jesus,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   not just knew Jesus, but lived with Jesus,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   ate with Jesus at the dinner table,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   maybe argued with Jesus, okay,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   maybe threw the football with Jesus.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   No, they didn't throw the football. It wasn't there yet.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But they hung out with Jesus a whole lot.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And so we know that James probably was not a believer
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   that Jesus was the Christ until the resurrection.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So the whole time in his life, he just thinks his brother is kind of weird,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   going around claiming to be the Messiah and walking on water and stuff.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And then all of a sudden he comes back to life.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And did you know that then James, this is history now,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   James gave his life for the cause of the resurrection.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   In fact, the Jews at that time came to James and said,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   "James, you've got to stop talking about the resurrection."
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   He said, "I will not. I saw my brother came back to life."
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And so they threw him off the top of the temple.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   He wasn't dead yet though, so they went down there
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and they beat him with clubs until he wasn't breathing anymore.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   James died a martyr. That's the one who wrote this book.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   It's known as the New Testament Proverbs,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   a book of wisdom from Jesus' bro James.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It's written to the scattered church, the persecuted church,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   otherwise known as the Diaspora.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   This is who James wrote this letter to,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   but we can take it and apply it to our lives today.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So as we dive in, I want you to go back to a moment with me.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Do you remember that moment when you graduated?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   If you graduated, and maybe it was high school, I don't know,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   but you graduated and you're like,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   "You know what, I know what I'm going to do."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Everybody has this moment, "I know what I'm going to do.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   "I'm going to go to that city and I'm going to make a bunch of money.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   "I know what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over there
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   "and I'm going to make a name for myself.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   "I'm going to make it big. I'm going to go and do something good.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   "It's going to be awesome. I'm going to move there and do that.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   "I'm going to go to Dallas and do that."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And I'm just wondering, if it doesn't work out that way,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   why wouldn't God tell us?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   If it's going to be different than that,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   and we're all going to have that moment where we're sitting there like,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   "Hey, I'm going to move to that city and I'm going to make some money."
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Why wouldn't God tell us it's not going to be exactly like that?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Let's dive in.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Now listen, literally Greek is translated, "Go now."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He's trying to get your attention.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   "Go now, you who say today or tomorrow we will go to this city or that city.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   "Spend a year there. Carry on business and make money."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The Greek there for "carry on business" is "empadromai."
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It's literally where we get the word "emporium."
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   We're talking about a career here.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   We're talking about a place where you go to work to support yourself and others.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Your emporium, your place of business.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He says, "Hey, you need to listen to me if you think,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   'Hey, I'm going to move to Dallas and make some plans and make some money.'"
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   First question tonight is, "What is the purpose of your plans?"
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   What is the purpose of your plans?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Is it self-promotion?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Is it self-advancement?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Is it self-prospering?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   What do those three ideas have in common?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Self. Are you at the center of your plans?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Because if you are, I think you might have missed something.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   I want to talk to you really driven folks for a minute, you really gifted folks.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   You guys that get Dallas, Dallas wants to offer you something really special.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I get you, man. I get you. I understand you.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Let me talk to you for a moment.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Maybe in life you turn left and life takes you left.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Maybe in life you turn right and life takes you right.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   I want you to know something. I want you to hear me.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Sooner or later you're going to turn right and life's going to go left
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and your world's going to come crumbling down
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   because you put the wrong thing at the center of your life.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   You are living for the wrong purpose.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I tell you that because I love you. I tell you that because I've experienced it.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I tell you that because God's Word says that that's true.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And so you turn left and life takes you right and you fall apart
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   because you thought you were in control.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   For so long life let you think you were in control.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And then all of a sudden you realize you weren't.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Proverbs 16, 9 says it like this,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps."
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   So let me talk to you for a second.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   If you have a career goal, as you think, "Man, what do I want to achieve with my plans?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   What are the purpose of my plans?"
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   If the purpose of your plans is your happiness, you've missed it.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You do not have what's called a biblical worldview.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You have a worldly worldview.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   This is the message of the world that your happiness is ultimate.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I hear it so often, "Man, well, all I want for my children is for them to be happy."
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   No, you don't. You want them to be holy.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   In fact, if they're miserable and holy,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I would argue that's a whole lot better than them being happy.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Okay?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And so in the number one song in America,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   it's been the number one song for a few weeks, Pharrell Williams, "Happy."
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It has a subtle lie in it. Let me show you.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   It says, "Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like a room without a roof."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Because I'm happy, clap along if you know what happiness is to you.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like that's what you want to do.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   What he said is, "What's the truth is how you feel."
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And I want you to know that's an absolute lie.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So often, your feelings do not define reality at all.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   So often, what you feel is very different than what is.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   And you can maybe experience some happiness for a moment, but maybe you shouldn't.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And you can experience some despair in seasons, but maybe you shouldn't.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Your feelings do not define reality.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   There's another truth.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   What Pharrell is saying, that the end goal is that you would do everything that you can to be happy.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And I'm saying that God is saying you should do everything that you can to be holy.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   When we become holy, he makes us holy.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Christ's righteousness is given to us not by what we do, but what he did.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   And so if your happiness is your end goal, I'm afraid you're setting yourself up for failure.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   You can't pursue happiness and get it.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   In fact, the pursuit of happiness is a contradiction in terms.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   To pursue happiness is not to have happiness.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   It is synonymous with discontentment.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   What leaves you wanting--I've seen guys spend their entire life to the grave looking for happiness, but never finding it.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But the joy of the Lord, it comes from the Spirit.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Living in right relationship with him, it is a joy that you will never have without him.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Never even understand without him.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And so have you ever felt like your job was going to make you happy?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Let me ask you like this.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   This happens all the time.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   You ever had a dream job?
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   You're like, "Man, I found a great job."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   People tell me, "Dude, I got a great job.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   "Man, I landed this job. It's the best job. It's my dream job."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   The cynical part of me is like, "Give it some time, man.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   "Pretty soon it's just going to be a job."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I learned this early in life.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I graduated from college. I was living with my best friend's parents.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   I was waiting tables at the time, and I woke up one morning, and I was like, "Man, I'm going to get a real job today."
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   I'm not saying waiting tables is not a real job, but that's where I was at.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I was like, "I'm going to get a real job today."
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   So I put on some khakis and a polo at 8 in the morning.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I left the house. Usually I wasn't up before 8.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   So I leave the house, and I'm driving around Waco, Texas.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I'm like, "I'm going to get a real job, but I don't know where to go to get a real job in Waco."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   So I go to one of the only places I know. I go to the mall.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The problem is the mall is not open.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   So I sat in the parking lot. I don't even think I was a Christian.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I wasn't following Jesus. I don't think I was saved.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   But I prayed, "God, would you help me find a job?"
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And I sat in my truck for an hour.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And they came, and they unlocked that mall door, and I walked inside.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And I'm walking through the mall, and this girl comes up to me and says, "Hey, what's your story?"
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And I said, "Well, I'm looking for a job."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And she goes, "Oh, yeah?"
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And she goes, "You want to work at Abercrombie?"
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And I said, "Is this how this prayer thing works?"
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And I go, "Sure."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   She goes, "You want to manage at Abercrombie?" I said, "Sure."
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   She goes, "Where?" I said, "How about Dallas?" She goes, "Okay, I'll get you an interview there."
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   So I drive to Dallas. I interview at North Park Abercrombie.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I go back to Waco. They call me. They offer the job.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I'm going to give you some details. It might make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   But they call me. They offer me the job.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   They said, "Hey, we'd like to offer you $23,000 a year."
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And I began to weep. Tears of joy.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Okay? Truly, my best friend came in.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I remember, given just this long, awkward, manly embrace.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And he said these three words, "You made it."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It was actually four words. It was, "Dude, you made it."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And I was just like, "Yes, I did, man. I did. I'll do this the rest of my life."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And so I moved to Dallas, and I did it for three months, and I quit.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And then I got a job selling gym memberships.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   100% commission, eat what you kill. I was like, "Dude, I have found it.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I'm good at this, too. I will do it forever."
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I did it for three months, and I quit.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Sold this guy this gym membership. He was in telecom.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Okay? I went and worked in telecom.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I was making more money than I ever thought that I would make.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I will do this forever. I did it for three months, and then I quit.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   My boss took me to another telecom company. I worked there for three months.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   This is true. I worked there for three months. It went bankrupt.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   I was 21 years old and laid off.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And I was like, "What just happened?" My whole world was spinning.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I will never work in telecom again.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   So I did what anyone would do, and I went back to work at telecom.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I did that for five years, and I climbed up the corporate ladder.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And I don't mean to boast. This is just kind of what happened.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And I started pursuing this path, this career in sales.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And when I was making $23,000, it was more money than I ever knew what to do with.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Now I was making 10 times that, and I was very much aware that it would never be enough.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Something happened in a very short period of time.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I began to pursue fulfillment in my work.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And I got caught up in it, realizing that fulfillment now--
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I realized fulfillment cannot be found in your work.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Your work will never fulfill you. It was not meant to.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   In fact, God said it will be hard, and it will war against you.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   As a result, in the fall, your job cannot fulfill you.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It will be difficult, he says.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   You cannot avoid that difficulty.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And so I think some of our hope is constantly what we will have in the future.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   We're constantly trying to see around the corner.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And I'm telling you, you have set yourself up for some despair, maybe even depression, some hurts.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Why? Why would I say that? Let me show you from the Word, verse 14.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   You don't know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   What is your life?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Why? You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Can I show you what James just said your life was?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Look, I'm going to show you a picture of your life. Infancy to the grave. Ready?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Did you see it?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Let me show you your life again. Ready? Here today.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   One more time. Your life.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Here today and gone. It's banished.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   You're like, "No, it's not."
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   We've asked you before, "What's your great-great-grandfather's name?" You don't know.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Dude, that's family.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   That's family. Some of you are living on his money, man.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   You don't even know his name. He was alive 50 years ago.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Your life is a vapor.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Oh, let me get this straight. Your strategy is to work hard.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Make as much money as you can so that you can experience as much comfort as you possibly can.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And then die.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And then go to a place that you will be forever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And there it says you can store up treasures, but you had them here.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Hey, friends, that's bad investing at best.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   That's just bad investing at best. Ask any financial advisor.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   If you are investing in a temporary asset and going somewhere permanent, it's just not a good strategy.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   It's a bad strategy at best.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And so there must be a bigger purpose in our career and our plans than us.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   There must be something else. He who dies with the most still dies.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Verse 15, "Instead," okay, instead, he's going to resolve this.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   "Instead you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.'
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   As it is you boast in your arrogant schemes, all such boasting is evil."
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   He says, "Instead, you need to acknowledge the one who is actually in control."
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And so that's my second question this evening is who is determining your direction?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Who is determining your direction?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Asked in another way, it is who is driving?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Are you in the driver's seat?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I meet with young adults all the time, 20s and 30-somethings all the time,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   who are very upset with God because of where they ended up.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And it looks like this, it looks like, "God, how come you let me be in this relationship?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   God, how come I got in this career? You knew I was going to get laid off.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   You knew that guy would be my boss. God, I'm so mad at you."
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And my sense is that God's like, "Bro, you didn't even ask me.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Sister, you did not even ask me. You didn't consult me.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   I've been jumping up and down, waving my arms, saying, 'Hey, don't date him.'
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   But you weren't listening.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I was telling you, 'Hey, that job, that's not the best use of your gifts and your talents.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I've got other plans for you. I want you to glorify me. I want you to honor me somewhere else.'
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   But you didn't consult with me."
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And some of you might have, but how are you listening?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   How are you listening to him?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Like if you're not regularly in this book, if you're not living life in community,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   if you're not diligently meeting with other followers of Jesus and seeking their counsel,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   as the Scripture says over and over, "Wisdom comes from the counsel of others yielded to the Spirit,"
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   then you have hushed the voice of God.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   You've told the Holy Spirit to be quiet. You're not interested in his counsel.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   That you're going to go the way that seems right to you.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Proverbs 14, 12 says it ends in death.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And you're mad at God, and God's like, "Oh, I would have loved to help you. You didn't ask.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I would have loved to chat with you, but you didn't talk to me."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   This hit home for me.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Years ago, before vocational ministry, Monica and I were processing a move back to Waco now.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And so a friend of mine had started a company there, and the company had kind of taken off.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And he sat down with me and said, "Hey, I would love for you to kind of influence our sales organization.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You would work side by side with me. We'd be partners in the business."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And the entrepreneurial side of me was very attracted to this.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And so I would tell you that it was something we wanted to do.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   We went to Waco, and we began to look at real estate there.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And this opportunity was going to afford us to buy a house on property.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And we were very excited about that.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   We began to interview churches there.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   We were believers now and followers of Jesus now.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And so we're looking at churches there in Waco.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And I began to wrestle with this idea, "What is God's will? What is God's will?"
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And so I couldn't figure it out.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   So I finally gathered some wise men.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Also this idea of community.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   And I sat them down, and I said, "Hey, guys, I don't know what God's will is."
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And one of them began to point out a flaw in my thinking.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   See, I really wanted to move to Waco.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And he just said this.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   He asked me these questions, which changed my life, rocked my paradigm even.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   He said, "If you go to Waco, and this business really takes off, and you make a ton of money, it goes public even,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and it just goes so well, was it God's will that you went there?"
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And he said, "If you move to Waco, and this business fails miserably,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   two weeks in, the doors are shut, and you have to move in with your in-laws,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   and you can't feed your children, you can't buy them food,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   was it God's will that you would go to Waco?"
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   And I said, "Absolutely not."
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And he said, "I think you've got it all wrong.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   You're processing God's will based on your own desires and your own desires alone."
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And he said, "Jonathan, is it possible that God would keep you here and refine you
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   and sanctify you through difficult times, and that would be His will?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Is it possible that He would send you to Waco, and He would sanctify you there through some challenging times?"
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   As James also says, "Rejoice in those trials."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Is that possible, that that would be the Lord's will?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   And then he said this, and it changed everything.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He said, "You need to be asking, 'Where can I honor God the most?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Where can I bring God the most glory?'"
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   That is, to honor Him, to serve, and to love Him.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   He told us, "Hey, I want you to love me and love my people."
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   He said, "Where can you do that the most?"
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And it changed everything.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   We ended up staying in Dallas because we were plugged into a church here,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and thriving in a community here, and growing in our faith here by others who were teaching us the Word.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And it made all the difference.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   When we answered that question, "God, where?"
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   So this is crazy.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   You could have a job that's a good job, that pays more money than your current job,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   and God could say, "No, stay there, because that's where I have you doing ministry."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And you could be like, "God, I hate it."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And He might say, "I need to change your perspective.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I need to work on your heart, and I need you to stay there."
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And you're asking Him the question, "God, where can I bring you the most glory?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Where can I honor you the most?"
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   It's such a selfless question.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It feels almost Christian.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   So I'm telling you that your job was not meant to fulfill you.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   It just wasn't.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   So what is it for if it's not meant to fulfill you?
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Titus 2:10, in a great verse, just says this.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   It says that you work, you have a career, so that in every way you will make the teaching about God, our Savior, attractive.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   You work so that in every way you will make the teaching about God, our Savior, attractive.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   What does James say?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   James says it like this in verse 17.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Listen.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   "If anyone then knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for them."
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Okay, man, this feels like a new idea.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Like James just went ADD on us.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It feels like a little bit.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Okay, it feels like that doesn't fit with the others, and I want to make an argument that it does.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   This last verse here, "If anyone," listen, "then knows the good they ought to do and they don't do it, they sin."
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Man, what is he saying?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Okay, this is this profound idea that I believe is extremely biblical and repeated throughout the Scriptures, and it is simply this.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Stop wondering what you're supposed to do and look at the good for you to do right in front of you.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Start considering where does God have me and why does he have me there?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   What is the good that I can accomplish right in front of me?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Maybe I'm so distracted by my schemes and my desires and my plans, which don't include God.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   If I'm honest, they're all about me, and I have missed the purpose why a sovereign creator has me right where he has me.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   See, so often we get so caught up in the unrevealed will of God.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   "God, what is your will for me? God, what do you want me to do? Who do you want me to marry? Where do you want me to work?"
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And we've forsaken the revealed will of God.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And some of us, you know, and God's like, "Why would I tell you my unrevealed will when you've forsaken my revealed will? My revealed will."
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I've told you what to do right there in the Scriptures.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I want you to love me with your whole heart, mind, and strength, and I want you to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I want you to do the good I have you to do right in front of you.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Will you open your eyes? Will you listen to me? Will you consult with me?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I want to play. I want to use you. I made you for this very purpose.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Can we hang out, man? Can we do this thing? Can I talk with you?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   A third question, final question is this.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   What good does God have for you to do right where you are?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   What good does God have for you to do right where you are?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   I will tell you that miserable jobs make excellent mission fields.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Miserable jobs make excellent mission fields.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Guys, here's the question. Do you believe that God is sovereign?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   That means do you believe that he's put you where you are for a purpose?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Do you believe that? Like, do you believe that?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Like, has his hand slipped off the wheel, or is he still driving this cart?
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Did he put you strategically exactly where you are?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I want to show you from the scriptures and make a case that he has.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Acts 17, verse 24 says this.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   and does not live in temples built by human hands.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   And one man," listen closely, "he made all the nations,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   that they should inhabit the whole earth," this part,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   "and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   He chose where they live and when they live.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   He is sovereign over that.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   He has made you for this very purpose."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   This is crazy that God puts you in that company, in that school,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   that God puts you in that community, in that place that he's driving
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   and he has his servant right where he wants his servant,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   and he is very much in control.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And he's doing something, and I don't want you to miss it
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   by not seeing the good that you are to do right in front of you.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Paul says it like this, Ephesians 2:10, "For we are God's handiwork.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   We are his masterpiece. We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works."
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Literally, the Greek is to walk through the good works
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   which God has prepared in advance for us to walk in.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   God made you for a purpose, and he has you right where he wants you,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   and he's accomplishing his will through you if you will look his way
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   and pay attention to what he's doing and seek out his agenda.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   See, Presley thought, "I was there for what she wanted."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Do you know why I didn't go right when she turned right?
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Because I wasn't there for what she wanted. I was there for what she needed.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   I was there to get groceries. I had an agenda, man.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And I was accomplishing something that was bigger than her,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   but it certainly helped her because she needs to eat.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And so I was there for something that she needed,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   and she thought I was there for whatever she wanted.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Guys, God loves you, man. He's crazy about you.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   This is so awesome. This is great news I'm giving you.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   God loves you, and he's in control.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   He controls everything, and he loves you.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Man, how awesome is that? God's so awesome.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   That's so awesome that he controls everything, and he looks at you, and he's crazy about you.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And then he has a plan for you, a purpose for you,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and he's created you with some gifts purposefully for him.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Can I show you how James' brother says it?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   This is beautiful. Listen. It comes from the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   It's Jesus.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   He says, "You," read you, "are the light of the world.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   A town built on a hill cannot be hidden,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Instead, they put it on its stand.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   They put it purposefully where it goes,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   In the same way, let your light shine before others,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   This is what Jesus is saying, is that in the first century homes,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   lights were very expensive. They didn't have a lot of lights.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   They had one light, and they would have to put that light in a very strategic place.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   They couldn't put it in a place where its light would be wasted.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   They would put it in a place purposefully so that others can see.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Jesus is saying that God has put you in a place purposefully so that others can see.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   See who? See Him and glorify your Father in heaven.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   That God has put a light at AT&T and a light at that Richardson ISD
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   and a light at that place of business and a light at that company
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   and a light in that place and a light in that community so that others can see.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And He put it in a very purposeful place, a very strategic location,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   so that by it others would see Him.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   "They would see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   How, JP? How can they do that?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   By you doing the good in front of you that He has for you to do.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   In your quarter-life crisis, stop saying, "Where, God? Where?"
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and start saying, "How, God? How?"
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Start saying, "What, God? I'll do it."
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Stop saying, "Where, God? Where do you want me to work?"
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   and start saying, "God, how do you want me to work right here?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   God, what do you want me to do right here
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   so that I can honor you and be on mission for you?"
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And so stop trying to find your purpose in your career
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and start being purposeful in your career.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I'm telling you that someone has to take out the trash.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Someone has to do those things, and it might be you.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Someone has to do the things no one else wants to do,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and God might have created you to do those things so that you can be--
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Some of you are like, "But, JP, you don't understand.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Where I work, it's really dark."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Good. God has a light there. Turn it on.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Okay? He puts you there on purpose.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Would you shine? Would you shine?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Your purpose is not fulfilled in what you do, but how you do it.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   So what you need is not a new job.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   What you need in this quarter-life crisis is a new perspective in your job.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   What you need most is not a new job.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   What you need is a new perspective in your career.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   So in summary, what is the purpose in your plans?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I'd love for you to ask these questions in your community group this week.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And you can even pray this. This is just a great prayer there.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   "God, you have me here for a purpose. Help me see it."
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   You ask them, "Who is determining my direction?"
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And you can pray this.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   "God, I don't want to go unless you're sending me. Help me hear you."
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   You can ask them, "What does God have for you to do right where you are?"
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And you can pray, "God, you have me here for a purpose. Give me the courage to do it.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Give me the wherewithal to stay here, the stamina, the energy, the joy that I need.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   God, I hate it. Help me. Sanctify me. Make me yours. Take my life. I'm almost dead. Use me."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   I was speaking at a conference not very long ago in this past year.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I needed an illustration. The title of the talk they assigned to me was "Work is Worship,"
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   which is a topic I'm very passionate about.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And I was looking for this illustration, and I'll tell you the illustration I was looking for.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   It was somebody that was doing a task in a company, but they were actually undercover, like undercover agents.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And so they're actually working for this larger organization, a government organization,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   but they have to do the day-to-day mundane tasks in this company.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   That was the illustration that I was looking for.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   And so a friend of mine asked me if I had seen the movie "The Informant."
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And I had not, and you don't need to either. It's not very good.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   But it's a movie that came out in 2009 starring Matt Damon.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   I think we might have a picture. There we go.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   And it was called "The Informant," and it was actually a true story.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Now, it's a confusing story, so listen closely.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Okay? It is the true story of a man named Mark Whitaker.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Mark Whitaker worked at a company called ADM.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   At that company, there was the largest price-fixing scandal in U.S. history.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Here's all you need to know.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   There's some people doing some illegal stuff at this company, so illegal that the FBI got involved.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   The FBI finds Mark, who works there, and says, "Hey, we need your help.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   We want you to be undercover for us."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   So for three years at this company, Mark Whitaker wore a wire every single day to work.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And the instructions they gave him, "We want you to work hard," okay, so you're not to get caught.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   "We want you to talk to a lot of people, to gather information.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   And we want you not to lose your job. Just stay there so that you can help us out.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   Report back to us."
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Now, I wanted some more information, so I told my friend who told me this,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   "Man, I wish I could gather some more information on this deal."
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   And he goes, "Why don't you email him?"
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And I said, "Email him? How am I going to do that?"
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   He goes, "Well, it turns out I found his email on the Web.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   You can find anything with Google. And so here, here's his email address."
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   So I emailed Mark Whitaker, and I asked specifically,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   "Mark, when you were doing those day-to-day tasks, I imagine they became boring.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Were they more exciting when the FBI said, 'Hey, now you're really working for us,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   but we want you to do the same thing'?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Did it become more exciting?"
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I had just finished up a porch Tuesday night. It was 930. I was here.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   My phone rang. I said, "Hello."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   I said, "Jonathan, this is Mark Whitaker."
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   I said, "Yeah, right."
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   He said, "No, it really is."
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   He said, "Hey, I got your email. I want you to know, absolutely, man,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   when the FBI came to me and they said, 'Hey, we want you to do the same things,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   but this time we need you to report to us.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   We need you to work hard so you don't get caught.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   We need you to talk to a bunch of people to gather information,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   and then we want you to report back to us all that you have found
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   so that we can stay involved in what you're doing.'"
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Man, my job became so exciting.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Every day I went to work so excited because my perspective had changed.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Guys, don't you see that's what happened?
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   You have been sent by your commanding officer, not the president of the United States,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   not the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   and he put you where you are, and he has a mission for you to accomplish there.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Do you know what Mark told me next?
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   He said, "But, JP," he said, "it's nothing like the mission I have today."
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   And I said, "Oh, yeah? Why? Why do you say that?"
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Well, it turns out that Mark actually himself got involved in that price-fixing scandal,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   and he went to prison.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   He served years in prison, and in prison he met a mutual friend of ours, Chuck Colson,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   the late Chuck Colson.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Chuck Colson shared the gospel with him, and in prison Mark trusted Christ.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And now out of prison, Mark travels the world and tells people about Jesus.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   He said, "Hey, I see you work at a church. I'm a follower of Jesus too."
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   He said, "I've never felt more on mission than I am right now."
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Do you know what he told me?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   He said, "At ADM, I made $3 million a year."
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   He was an executive. $3 million a year.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   He said, "In the United States penitentiary, I made $29 a month, less than a dollar a day."
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   He said, "I had never felt more on a strategic undercover mission than I did in the U.S. penitentiary."
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   For the first time, I understood why I was actually created.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I understood that God was sovereign over my plan, even in prison.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   See, also Joseph.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   And that God could use me there to save people, and he has been.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Friend, you're quarter-life crisis.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   You don't have a job problem. You don't have a career problem.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   You have a perspective problem.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   You don't understand that God created you for a purpose.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   You've been living for you, man.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   And I'm here to tell you, you can live for him right where he has you.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   You can shine and be a light and let him call others to know him in greater ways.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   If you would just move past yourself, work hard so you don't get caught.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   Talk to others because you love them, and report back to him, your commanding officer,
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   so that he can stay involved in what you're doing.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Father, we do ask that you would help us do exactly that.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   We understand that our life is but a vapor, God,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   and that you have plans for us that are bigger than us.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   So, God, would you use us?
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Father, that person that sits in the cube next to us, would you save them?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   That teacher in the other classroom, God, would you save them?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   That coworker, would you allow them to see my good deeds and glorify you in heaven?
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Father, would you use me for your honor and for your glory?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Would you glorify yourself through me?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   And as I'm asking questions, where should I go and what should I do,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   what I consider most important, what my friends here tonight at the porch consider what is most important,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   is where can we honor you the most?
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Father, use our lives.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   I pray that Jesus would be ultimate,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   that you would remove all of the other distractions,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   and that he would be of most importance to us.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   It's in his name.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   Amen.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   I just don't want you to miss what you're saying.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Jesus commands my destiny.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   It's true.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   He sure does.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   In Christ alone, man.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   And so some of you, you have forsaken your purpose because you don't know God.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   And my hope is that you're surrounded by people right now who do.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And so when I'm talking about things like relationship with God or talking to God or consulting with God,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   that's like this foreign idea because you're in your car and you're praying to him,
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and he feels really far or like he's not there at all.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   It feels like your prayers are being kept in that cab.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Or when you lay in bed and you talk to him, it feels like they're bouncing off the ceiling.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   I've been there.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   I've been there.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And here's what you need to know, that 2014 years ago in the greatest event in the history of the world,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   God became a human, fully God and fully man.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   He lived a perfect life for about 33 years.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   He's the most polarizing character in the history of the world.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   The book is bestseller year after year and also in the history of the world by a large significant margin.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   His followers are a majority in regards to religion.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   But what he asked of you is love and to know him.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And what he did was the greatest example of love is he took your sins on him on a cross.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Every image you've looked at that you shouldn't have,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   every person you've slept with, everything that you've done, word that you said,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   place that you've been, drink that you consumed, line that you snorted went on him.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   He goes in the grave and he came out without it.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   He stayed in the grave, man.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And if you've trusted in that, it's no longer you who lives but Christ who lives in you.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Yeah, it's good news, man.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   You can't even do good on your own.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   It's a dependence thing.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   God, help me see it.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Give me the courage to do it with your spirit through me accomplish it.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   I can't even do it on my own.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   And so if you've trusted in that, he got what you deserved and you get what he deserves.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   You get to be with God forever in his kingdom and he'll work to you even now in this place
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   as we patiently await for his return.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   He's coming back too.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   And so I pray that you would live that mission out.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Don't get caught up in your quarter life crisis.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Let's build a movement of people in this season changing the world.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   [silence]
