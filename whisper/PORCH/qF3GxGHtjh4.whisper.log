[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room, everyone joining us online.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And I want to specifically welcome Portslive Des Moines, Portslive Southwest Minnesota,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Portslive Cedar Rapids, Portslive Tulsa, Portslive Scottsdale, Portslive North Houston,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   all the other Portslive locations, everybody online, everybody in the room.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We are continuing this series, Anti-Suppressants,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   where we are looking at God's prescription from His Word for healing.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And let me start by inviting you guys a little bit into my world, my life for the past week.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Last weekend, I purchased a Lyft.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And it wasn't a car-sharing ride like Lyft or Uber.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   It was a Lyft kit for a golf cart that I'm fixing up.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Everyone has their hobbies.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   You were watching the game or at the pool.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I was putting Lyft kit on a golf cart.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Why, you ask?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Why not, I ask.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And ladies probably won't understand this, but there's just something, you know,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   why would you want a normal golf cart if you can jack it up like it's a monster truck or something?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And so I purchased this Lyft.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It was super cheap.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And I thought, oh, man, I'm going to throw this on.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It'll take me like two hours.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Not at all what happened.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And part of the reason was because it arrived in the mail, and I took it out,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   and I took out all the components and the bolts and nuts and just the things that made up the Lyft,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   and it didn't have instructions.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And I had never done this before.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So I'm forced to look at the cart, look underneath it, look at the Lyft, look at the cart,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   try to figure this thing out and have to figure my way out as I go, which didn't go so well.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   At one point, the entire back end of the cart almost fell completely on me.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   The motor fell out of it.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It just was a mess.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And what I thought would take two hours still has not been completed over the last, like, six days.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Now, what does that have to do with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Well, in a very similar way, the subject we're discussing is one where often people approach it,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   and they don't quite know how to do it because there's not clear instructions they've been given.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And that topic is that of forgiveness.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   In other words, when it comes to the subject of what it means to forgive and how do I forgive,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   we're often going through life, and we're kind of told you should do it, and it's important,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   but in terms of how exactly do I forgive some of the most painful experiences in my life,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and the good news is God's Word wants you to have step-by-step instructions on how you can do that.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Tonight, if you're joining us for the first time,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   it's going to feel like you're jumping into the middle of a conversation because you are.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Last week, we opened this series, and I did a high-level discussion of forgiveness,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and it was too much for us to just rush by in one week, so we broke it up into two weeks,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   and this week is part two of that discussion.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Last week was high-level.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You can go back and see that on the app or on YouTube or Spotify, wherever you listen to messages,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and this week, we're going to not talk about why we as believers forgive.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That was last week.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   We looked at it because God has commanded it, because of the forgiveness God has extended to us,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and because in doing so, we experience freedom.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Tonight, we're going to talk about how, and this is a message I believe God has some of you.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   You may just be here for this one Tuesday, and he has you here because there's someone in your life you have not forgiven,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   and Christians are not called to just have the title of Christians but the lifestyle of Christians,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   and Jesus over and over said, "If you're going to follow me, you will forgive people,"
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and I know, Representative, in this room, there's a lot of pain.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   When we brought up Father's Day a second ago, that's not a day of celebration.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's a day that reminds you of what you didn't have or the terrible father you did have.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Whatever your story, if you're coming in the room, and there are people that you--their name,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   the memory you have attached to them, part of your heart just feels bitter towards them,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and how do I know if I'm bitter?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   If there's anyone in your life you hope to see fail or you're glad when they suffer, you're bitter.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   If there's someone who you would avoid seeing in public because of the relational strain
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and what happened between you, there's a good chance that you're harboring anger, bitterness,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   and God wants you to experience the healing that happens when you decide to forgive,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   which is why over and over he commands it, and tonight, I want to walk through very specifically how,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and I'm going to go slow around the turns to make sure you understand what forgiveness is
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and then how we apply it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Candidly, this is a message, and learning the skill of forgiveness, which very few people do
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   because very few people even understand what it means to forgive,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   has the potential to change the course of your life.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Certainly, it's going to change the course of your future marriage relationships, parenting relationships,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   you, healing, and so we're going to walk through that.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   First, I want to reintroduce you to the definition we gave last week, the biblical definition.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   What does it mean to forgive?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Because there's a lot of misinformation.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Like, forgiveness is not forgetting.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   If you think, "Man, if I still remember it, then I haven't forgiven," that's not true.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Forgiveness is not forgetting.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   If anything, you have to remember in order to forgive someone.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Forgiveness is not excusing what happened.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's not pretending like, "Man, it wasn't a big deal when they abused me.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It was a huge deal."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   But you're still called to forgive.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Forgiveness is not minimizing or belittling it.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The sin that happened against you was such a big deal, Jesus had to come on the cross and die.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Forgiveness is not the restoration of a relationship.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Like, in other words, you can forgive someone and it doesn't make you best friends.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But it is a command.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And the last thing is forgiveness is not fair.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And if part of you in this message feels like, "Man, it's just not fair.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   It's not right.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And if I forgive them, I'm letting them off the hook," that's not true either.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But forgiveness isn't fair.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Just like if you're a Christian, God's forgiveness towards you wasn't fair.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And although it's not fair, it's the invitation God has given each of us.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And when we accept that invitation, we experience healing.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   The biblical definition of forgiveness is this.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It is releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It is I am choosing not to say it didn't happen, not to say it wasn't a big deal, not to say it didn't hurt.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   All those things are true or can be true.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   It is the decision to I am releasing my demand for payback to God.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And we're going to unpack exactly what that means and how we can do that very specifically.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   But before we dive in, the definition of forgiveness is releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It is canceling the debt, the hurt that their actions created in you, which comes right out of Matthew 18.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We looked at it last week where basically Jesus calls his disciples when he's asked the question, "How often do we forgive?"
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   He says, "You never stop.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You forgive someone over and over and over and over."
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And then he tells a parable, and in the parable, he gives us Jesus' definition of forgiving.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   In Matthew 18, he tells the story of a king and how he canceled a debt.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   He says, "I forgave you that tremendous debt and had mercy on you.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had to you?"
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So biblically, it is releasing the debt but the demand for payback, demand for justice to God.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So we're going to walk through three steps.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The first step, identify what to forgive.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   This is huge, and you're not going to learn this outside of the New Testament teaching of forgiveness anywhere that I know.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   What do I mean?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   By identify the debt.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   This may be the biggest takeaway that you're going to take.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   If biblically forgiving someone is saying, "Here's what you did to me.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Here's what you took from me, and I am choosing not to hold that against you."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   It is a really difficult thing to forgive or release the need for payback,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   to release that debt that was created, if I don't know what was taken.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   In other words, I can't forgive you for what you stole from my house if I don't know what you stole from my house.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And biblically, canceling that debt involves identifying what was taken.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Like every time somebody hurt you, sinned against you, neglected, abandoned, abused, sinned,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   there's the fact that it happened, then there's the impact it had.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   There's the fact that it happened and the fact of what was taken.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Every time somebody has sinned against you or me, there's a debt that is created.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Part of the way that we forgive is by looking it in the eye and saying, "This is what was taken,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and I'm not holding that against you anymore."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   We tend to forgive generally because we kind of hurt generally.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Like, "You really hurt me."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   We never take the step and process of going, "Man, I'm identifying exactly what you took,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   exactly what happened and what you took as a result of it."
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So we can't actually forgive.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   But the first step comes in identifying, "This is exactly what happened,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and I'm choosing to forgive."
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   In my own life, I realized I had some hurt about 10 years ago.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I was talking about with a friend related to my dad,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and I was raised almost entirely by a single mom for most of the memory years that I have.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And my dad wasn't around.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   He wasn't walking with Jesus.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   There just wasn't a real strong relationship.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   We'd see each other at holidays, and my siblings would drive across town two times a month
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   due to custody orders, and we'd see him in this tiny little apartment.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And I realized, like, I was carrying some real hurt,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and somebody gave me the teaching of forgiveness.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It's really hard to forgive someone if you don't know what they took from you.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And so I went and I sat down, and I took out a journal, and I began to write,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and I just began to write out, "You took from me this.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   You took from me this.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You took from me having a dad in the home.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   You took from me having a father show up at sporting events.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   You took from me the ability to see what God's design for marriage was meant to look like.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You took from me every other Monday night where I had to drive across town and go to that apartment.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You took from me having a father close in my life."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And I sat down, and I began to write out everything that was taken,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   because if I was going to make the decision, and you don't owe me anymore,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   it had to first involve me saying, "This is exactly what was taken."
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And maybe the best encouragement I could give you is that this week, you need to get alone.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And some of you guys have real hurt, and the step to taking ground in that real hurt
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   is by identifying the person, the action that was taken, and the impact that it had.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Because there's things that may have happened in your life, like maybe you were at your best friend's house,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and his cousin was staying there, and your life has never been the same,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   because that night, you were sexually abused.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And they took from you your innocence, and they took from you years ever since
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   that have had you in a battle with same-sex attraction.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Maybe it's a mom that just constantly--you just grew up in a home,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and they would constantly talk about food and weight, and just was like a big-digger mom,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and that led you to a place where you just found yourself so focused on the way that you look
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   and a number on a scale, and you turned to an eating disorder.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Maybe it was the fact that you grew up in a broken home like I did,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   and it led to some brokenness in your life, and that's not your fault, and you didn't ask for it.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But if you're going to forgive and experience healing, you've got to make the decision,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   "I'm going to identify what was taken, because I can't release that debt if I don't know what it is."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And this week, you would get alone by yourself and ask the question in order for you to heal.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   This has nothing to do with them.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   This is about you.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   What happened and what was taken?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Because the first step of experiencing forgiveness is by evaluating and identifying what needs to be forgiven
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   or what to forgive.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   The second step is by far the hardest.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   It is, "I'm deciding what I'm going to do."
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   It is by far the hardest.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It is, "I'm deciding to release the demand for justice to God."
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I am not holding on to this anymore, and I'm making that decision.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   In other words, forgiveness biblically is a decision.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   So when people say, "Man, I'm really trying to forgive," you don't try to make a decision.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   You make it.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And that may sound callous and sound like, "Man, you don't understand my story."
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   You're right, I don't, but God does.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And God is the one who, in Ephesians chapter 4, verse 31, said, "Get rid of all bitterness."
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Do you have any bitterness in your heart, any resentment in your heart?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Get rid of it.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   "Rage, anger, brawling, slander, along with every form of malice.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Be kind, compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   God forgave you."
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   The number of examples with Jesus, this was such at the heart of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   That Jesus over and over would just teach, and I don't have time to go into all of them,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   but there's so many examples of teachings in Scripture that you and I are called to forgive.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Mark chapter 11, verse 25.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   "When you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Colossians 3, verse 13.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   "Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you have.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Forgive as the Lord in Christ forgave you."
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Jesus in Luke chapter 6, verse 35-37.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   "Love your enemies, do good to them, lend without expecting anything back.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons in the Most High.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   He's kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Be merciful."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   The word merciful means to extend forgiveness to those who don't deserve it.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   "Just as your Father is merciful.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Don't condemn, you won't be condemned.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Forgive.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Release the demand for payback, and you will be forgiven.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   It is the decision I am choosing based on how I feel, based on my experience.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I am not holding this against you anymore."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And let me be honest, those feelings are real.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   The fact that you were assaulted, the fact that you were betrayed and lied to
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   by someone that you spent years dating with, and it was all a facade.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   The fact that you didn't have a mom in your life, you're only having one.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   There will not ever be another person on the planet who could be your mom,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and the one person who had a chance to be was gone.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Those are real.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   But the Bible says you and I are to walk by faith, not our feelings,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   and that our hurt feelings are not to be followed if they contradict
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   the holy instructions of God, who is saying, "Holding onto this will only hurt you,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and you have got to make the decision.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Here's what you took from me, and you don't owe me anymore."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I remember sitting down with that list and having that journal
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   and working through all of that and seeing all the pain, and it was real,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   and it is real, and making the decision.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   In light of the forgiveness I've been given, "Dad, you don't owe me anymore.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I am releasing and trusting God with that."
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   The reality is forgiving is an act of faith because it is saying,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "God, you tell me in your word every sinful action that has been done against me,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   every painful memory that I have, every hurt, every harm,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   will be paid for by that person eternally in hell because they have not trusted in Jesus,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   or was paid for by your son Jesus on the cross,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   and I am releasing my demand for justice to you.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I am trusting you with that."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Romans 12, verse 17 says, "Repay no one evil for evil.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   As far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Do not take revenge, but leave room for God's wrath.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   It is written, 'It is mine to avenge. I will repay.'"
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And to say to God, "I am choosing to not forgive this person,"
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   is to say, "The eternal torment of hell is not enough for the pain they created."
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Or if they're a believer, it's saying to God,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "The death of your one and only son Jesus on the cross, that may be enough for you, God.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   It's not enough for me, and they need to pay.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And however I can make them pay through the way that I treat them,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   or the way that I avoid them, or the way that I refuse to forgive them, I'm going to do."
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And God says, "The forgiven forgive people."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   We forgive because we've been forgiven.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   That's what each of those verses that I just read said.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Like God's grace doesn't just flow to us,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   and His forgiveness doesn't just flow to us.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It's to flow now through us, and how we interact with other people.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It's like this. This is an electrical outlet.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   You walk past hundreds of these every day.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   What's interesting is an electrical outlet is something that electricity flows to,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   and then it flows through.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   If you were to walk up to one of these that's inside of the wall,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and you were to take your iPhone charger, and you go plug it in,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   and it doesn't work, what's your thought?
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Oh, the power's out, or there's something wrong with this plug.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Either way, it's not connected to the energy,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   because an electrical outlet is to flow to it and through it.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   A Christian who does not have the forgiveness of God flowing through it
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   may not be a Christian, because it's not connected to the source
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   that's to flow to it and through it.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I know in the room there's a lot of pain, a lot of trauma.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It wasn't right, and it wasn't fair, and it wasn't your fault.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But it's a part of your story.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   That wasn't right, and that wasn't fair, and that wasn't your fault.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But you have the decision.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Are you going to forgive and release and experience healing?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Are you going to harbor that?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Why did I say it's an act of faith?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   As Christians, we believe that God is actually going to do what he said he's going to do.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   In other words, every sin will be paid for in eternity, in hell,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   or it's been paid for on the cross by Jesus.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And if none of that's true, if the Bible's not true,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Jesus didn't rise from the dead, nothing it says is true,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   when you die, you just go on the ground, you should be bitter.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   You should hold on to that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   You have every right.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   But if it's true, and God says, "Holding on to that is going to hurt you,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   release the demand for justice to me,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and I will make every wrong right, and every sin will be paid for.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   But as long as you hold on to it, it's going to harm you and harm your relationships."
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   The Bible says that when we don't release it and we bury it,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   it leads to dysfunction in our future relationships,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   not with the person who hurt us.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   In Hebrews 12, verse 15, it says this,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   "See to it no one fails to obtain the grace of God,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble."
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Hey, see to it nobody has a root of bitterness, take root, in their heart
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   that causes trouble in their life.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And by it, many become defiled.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   The author uses a brilliant analogy, because he says,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   "Hey, bitterness, it's like a root that gets buried."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   A root is something that, inside of plants, trees, back to botany 101,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   exists under the ground.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   In other words, you can't see it.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   But it's impacting everything that's above the surface.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And the author of Hebrews just said, "Bitterness, it's like a root.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   It's like something beneath the surface of your soul.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   No one can see it, but it's impacting what's happening on the outside."
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   And it's a hidden danger to yourself and to many people around you.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   In other words, you think that trust issue that you have from that guy
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   that you dated two years ago, and you just can't work through it,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   is just related to him.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   No, no, no.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   If you don't forgive him, it's going to follow you.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   The relationship that you have with your parents,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and how you're going to cut them out, and how I don't want anything to do with them,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   you think that's just between you.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   The author just said, "That's going to continue to have traces and impact in your life,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and you can choose.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I'm going to deal with it and uproot those roots and forgive."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Or it's not going away.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It's coming with you.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   In other words, anything, any bitterness in your heart, and I know it's real,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   and it's so painful to even think of forgiving.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   The person who molested you when you were six?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   The fact that the person who was supposed to protect me, provide for me,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   walked out on me?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And yet God is saying, "Anything that you don't allow him,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   and that bitterness through him to be transformed, will be transferred in your life.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Any hurt, any bitterness that you don't allow God, and decide,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   'Man, I'm going to not hold this, but release it,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and have it transformed from bitterness to forgiveness,'
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   it's going to be transferred to your next relationship,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and your next relationship, and your family dynamics,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   because it's not going away."
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   The author just said, "You deal with that root, or it's coming with you,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   and it's going to impact your future."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And God loves you.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   He loves you so much, He would give His life for you on the cross, and die for you.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And so, of course, He wants you to be free, and that happens by,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   "I'm identifying what happened, what was taken, and I'm making the decision.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   You don't owe me anymore, because I've released the demand for justice to God,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   and that is in His hands.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And I'm not pretending it was okay, or I'm not still hurt,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   but I'm not holding on to bitterness,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and I am releasing the need for payback to God."
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Number three, choose to forgive daily.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   There's a prayer that if you grew up in church, you're probably familiar with.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   It's called the Lord's Prayer.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And in it, it says, "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Think about what He just said.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Jesus is teaching His disciples, here's how you pray.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   He says, "God, You're amazing, You're incredible.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Your kingdom come in this world.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Bring it on, God.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   God, today, give me my daily needs, my daily food.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Will You provide for me?"
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   As in, "Hey, this is how you're praying on the daily, according to Jesus.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Forgive us, Lord, as we forgive those who have sinned against us."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Every time that you pray, Jesus is saying--
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I mean, that's what He's teaching.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He's not saying you just pray these words.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   He's saying, "Hey, here's how you should pray.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   You should go to God, worship Him as holy.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   You should invite His kingdom and be all about His kingdom coming,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   and talk to God about what you need.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You need a job, you need a car, you need gas,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   you need a Tesla right now, whatever you need.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You can talk to God."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And when you do, also bring up forgiveness.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   It was so at the front of Jesus' teaching
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   and at the heart of what it means to be a follower of Jesus
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   that even the way He prays, He said,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   "Every time you daily pray and go into God,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   oh, yeah, oh, bring up God and help me forgive
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   just like you have forgiven me."
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   How shocking this must have been to His audience,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I think is punctuated in the very next verse after the Lord's Prayer,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   after He goes through that,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   "Your kingdom come, Your will be done,"
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   all of that at the very end,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   "Lead us not into temptation, deliver us from evil."
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   That in verse 14, He highlights forgiveness
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   as how you should pray.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   All right, there you got the prayer.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Yeah, and the reason I said forgiveness is because,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   verse 14, "For if you forgive other people
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   when they sin against you,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   But if you do not forgive others in their sins,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   your Father will not forgive you your sins."
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Jesus picks one thing to highlight
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   out of the whole prayer He just gave, forgiveness.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It's not because He's invalidating your hurt,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   not because He wanted it to happen,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   it's because He wants you to experience freedom.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   As we said last week, bitterness is like drinking poison,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   hoping the other person pays for it.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And He wants you to experience healing.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And that involves choosing daily, daily, I'm going to forgive.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   In other words, forgiveness is a lifelong prescription
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   for some of the hurts you've already experienced
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   and a lifelong prescription just in general for believers.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   In other words, if you, like me,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   have friends that require medication daily,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   they'll have to take it for the rest of their life.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   One of my close friends has thyroid issues,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   and so he has to take thyroid medicine
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and will have to for the rest of his life.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Forgiveness is a medication you will have to take
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   for the rest of your life.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   It is, I am choosing when those feelings,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   'cause you're going to leave here,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and you're going to, at some point,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   maybe some of you guys are going to forgive someone
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   that really, really hurt you, and you made the decision.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Maybe it was a dating relationship,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   or it was a family member, and you're deciding,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   man, here's the debt they created,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I'm releasing that to God.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And some time goes by, and all of a sudden,
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   on your phone, iPhoto pops up,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   and they got the memories thing going on,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   or whatever the equivalent of Androids is, and that,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and you go, oh man, wow, that was a year ago?
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   I cannot believe how they treated me.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And in that moment, you have a decision.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I can either go down that
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   and let the root of bitterness begin to bury,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   or I can walk through the steps of going,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   here's what happened, here's what was taking,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and God, I am releasing that to you too.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Is holding on to that bitterness going to help you?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Jesus says no.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   It's going to hurt you and your future.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And I'm inviting you to experience,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   with so few people, I mean, you have people,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   just candidly, you're going to bump into people
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   at your workplace, they're 65,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   and they've never dealt with a father wound
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   they've carried since they were eight.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And you see them every day,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and you don't know it's there,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   and they don't talk about it,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   but it's the reason they've been divorced three times.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   'Cause they've never practiced the skill
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   that Jesus is saying, man, you got to learn,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   wherever you are, you may be a believer for one day,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   or for 14 years,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and you've been given the invitation, man,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   to identify, release it to God,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and to choose daily, hey, when this re-pops up again,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   I'm going to choose to forgive.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I was talking to a friend yesterday,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   we were talking about forgiveness,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   and it was someone on my team,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and I just asked, like, have you had to forgive someone
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   that's really hurt you?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And they began to share about someone in their family
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   that had abuse problems,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and the ways that that impacted their own life,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   and their anxiety,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   and I asked, have you forgiven them?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And they said, yeah,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   but sometimes I find myself hurt over things,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   over the fact that, like,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   they've never actually fully owned all the ways
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   that them going through all that addiction
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   put so much chaos and anxiety in my life,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   and maybe contributed to some of the reasons
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   why I just find myself so exhausted.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And when those emotions come,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and whatever that looks like for you,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   and for me, and for them,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   we have the decision to say,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   man, I can either hold onto that,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and I can wait for,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   well, they haven't asked for forgiveness,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   they may never ask for forgiveness,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   are you really going to put yourself
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   more underneath the power of the past,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   the influence of their actions?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   They don't have to be present for you to forgive them,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   it's not about them, it's your decision,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   I am releasing the demand for justice to God,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   I'm trusting that with you.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Some of you guys need to forgive people candidly,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   they're not even alive anymore,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and if they have to ask your forgiveness
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   in order for you to do that,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   and for you to move on,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   you're never going to get there,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   you're giving yourself a life sentence of bitterness,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   which is the alternative
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   to the life prescription of forgiveness.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And you have real pain.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And I saw it, man, like,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   a month ago, whenever we did,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   hey, here's the things, here's the shame,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   here's the pain that I carry,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   I can only imagine what wasn't said,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and that's real, and that's hurt.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   But this invitation is for you to heal,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and you to experience healing.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   That doesn't require them around.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Some of you have hurt,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   and maybe you have a relationship with them,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and they're a believer,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   and it would be appropriate
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   for you to go have that conversation.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   But my point is,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   forgiveness is between you and releasing it to God,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   it's not about them.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It's you deciding.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   I'm not holding this anymore.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I am releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   It is in His hands.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And my God does not lie,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   and He will keep His word,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   and He will keep His promises,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and every sin will be paid for in eternity in hell,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   or by Jesus on the cross,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and I'm choosing to trust Him.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That doesn't make what happened right,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   it makes trusting Him.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Trusting Him.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   A step towards healing.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And I want to experience healing,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   and become all that God created and wanted me to be.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   I was walking through church this past Sunday,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   and two things happened,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   like within five seconds of one another.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I was picking up my six-year-old son,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   and I asked, "Hey, what'd you learn in church today?"
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   And he said, "We learned about mercy."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And I said, "What's mercy mean?"
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   And he said, "It means giving someone forgiveness
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   "they don't deserve, like God gave to us."
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And I was like, "That's right."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And as we were walking,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   we were walking through like this,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   between these two towers and this sky tunnel
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   that connects these two buildings,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and a bird popped up out of nowhere.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   We were like inside of the building,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   and there's a bird literally flying into the window
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   just trying to get out.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And I walk up to it,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   and I'm trying to like get the bird,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   and he, not realizing,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   I'm just trying to get him no longer trapped
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   and set him free outside,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   resists, and he's up flying higher into the ceiling,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and it was like, "Well, so long, buddy.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   "You're on your own," and he kept moving.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   But the person who was there to help him be free,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   they thought was gonna harm him,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   or create a fear in him.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And God is telling you, "I'm not trying to hurt you.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   "I'm trying to help you be free.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "And the only way you can be free from the things
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   "that will follow you if you don't deal with them
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   "is by choosing to forgive,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   "that I'm releasing that,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   "and I'm trusting God."
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Forgiveness involves identifying.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Some of you are in a place right now
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   where you know the person that you need to forgive,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   and you know what was taken,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   and God is inviting you tonight.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   "I am choosing to trust you.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   "The same God who extended forgiveness to me
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   "that I do not deserve for sin that I did in my life,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   "far greater than anything that will ever be done to me,"
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   which is what the Bible teaches,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   "has extended me forgiveness
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   "for my past, present, future,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   "all of it nailed to the cross.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   "And I am trusting him with my eternal life,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   "and I'm trusting him in this life
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   "by forgiving what happened in it."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And you're ready.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Others of you may need to just take this week,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   and you need to just find some time,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and you sit by yourself, and you write off,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   "Here's what was taken.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   "You took my virginity
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   "when I had not even hit puberty.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   "You took parts of my life,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   "and my story, and years I may never get back."
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Some of you, you just need to say the words out loud,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   "I forgive you, Dad.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "I forgive you, Mom.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   "I forgive you, myself.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   "I am releasing that demand."
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Truly, as it relates to forgiving yourself,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   you can't forgive yourself.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Only God can extend forgiveness to you,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   but you can accept his forgiveness.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   But this week, some of us need to just get alone and go,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   "Man, here's what was taken."
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And if you do and make that decision,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   and God say, "I'm gonna release that to you."
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And then next week, when more emotions pop up,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and you find yourself, "I'm still hurt, I'm still angry."
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   That's gonna happen.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   You make the decision,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   "I am choosing daily to release this to God."
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And then the next time it pops up, and it happens again,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   "I am choosing to release the demand for justice to God,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   "because I wanna be free."
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And you're gonna be free.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Others of you have already dismissed everything that I've said
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   because the tremendous pain that you have
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   is creating a filter
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   that you don't trust.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   God is actually inviting this
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   to help you heal.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Forgiveness involves identifying,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   deciding,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   and committing.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   This past weekend, I was outside,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and it was like 185 degrees out.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And so, we had a sprinkler in the front yard,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   and in the backyard,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   and I basically turned on all the sprinklers,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and we just played soccer, me and my son.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Sprinkler soccer.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And we're out there playing.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   At one point, he falls, and he cuts his foot open
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   kind of between his two toes.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   He's covered in mud, and he's covered in the dirt,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   and I pull him to the side,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   and I begin to wash his foot off with water,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and then I get hydrogen peroxide.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And he's so concerned about, "Is it okay?"
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And at six, it's just like a waterwork show at all times.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And he doesn't know whether he's gonna have to amputate
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   or what's happening.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   It's just a little nick.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And I pull the hydrogen peroxide,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   and I pour it on there.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And he's going,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   "No, you made it worse!
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   "It hurts so bad!"
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And I tell him, "No, no, no.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   "This helps heal it
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "so it doesn't get infected and stay.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   "It's gonna heal."
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And my heart for anyone who's willing to take that step
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   is that you will experience healing.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Like, it'll be a wound that you're carrying right now,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   and you're gonna take that step of forgiveness,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   and it's terrifying 'cause you don't even wanna address
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   the past, and you don't wanna even address
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   or bring up the fact that the abortion took place,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   or you don't wanna even address the fact
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   that she said what she did,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   and you're afraid it's gonna hurt.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And God is saying, "It's gonna heal you."
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And it'll take that wound,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   and some of you, you're living life from a wound,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and it'll heal it.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And it may become a scar,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   but you won't be wounded.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   You'll be healed.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   And your story and your future marriage
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   and your parenting and your relationship with your kids
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and your life is gonna look different
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   than the one that you were raised in
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   because you courageously decided,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   "I'm not carrying this forward."
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   And you're gonna be healed
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   and experience healing
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   by identifying, deciding, and choosing daily,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "I will walk in forgiveness like I've been forgiven."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I'm gonna pray,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   and I wanna pray specifically for those of you in the room
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   that there is someone that you need to forgive.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   And I wanna invite you with your eyes closed
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   all around us when I pray in a second,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   if you will raise your hand,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I just wanna pray for you.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   There's a parent, there's somebody that played a role
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   where they did something and it was wrong.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It was evil.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   It took something from you.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   And maybe you just don't even want to forgive them,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   but you're willing to say,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   "God, I wanna want to forgive them.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   "Will you help me?"
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Or maybe you're in the room and you're like,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   "I wanna forgive them and I wanna take that next step."
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And I just wanna pray that you would have courage,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   clarity, conviction to be able to do so.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And so when I pray,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   I just wanna invite you right now,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   will you raise your hand?
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   And I wanna ask especially for God's grace
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and God's help and God's strength.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   So let me pray.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And if that's you, I just wanna invite you right now
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   to raise your hand wherever you're at.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Father, I know that you know every story
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   of every hand raised and not.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   You know every hurt of every heart that is in this room.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   You know all of the ballet lessons where no one showed up.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   You know all of the relationships that ended in betrayal.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   You know every story of abuse.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   You know every story of tremendous hurts.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Every sports competition where nobody showed up.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Every time that a child witnessed
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   the unraveling of their parents' marriage in front of them.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Every toxic behavior modeled.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   And you tell us that you have shed your blood
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   for all of those sins and all of our sins.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   And I pray right now for strength
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   for every hand that was raised,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   for every person that is just at a place saying,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   God, I want to want to forgive, will you help me?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I pray that you would help them.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   For every person who is saying,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Lord, I want to experience healing
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   and I need to experience healing.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And I need to forgive them.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Would you help them?
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Give them the clarity to identify it,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   the courage to take the step of releasing that to you.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   And the willingness to walk in that
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   as many times as we need to until you come back
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   or until we go home to be with you forever.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And I pray that you would experience
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   or they would experience healing
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   in the deepest crevices of their heart.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And your spirit right now would rush in to bring healing.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   We worship our King right now in song
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and we make room for you in our hearts
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   and we declare that and invite you in.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.320]   (whooshing)
