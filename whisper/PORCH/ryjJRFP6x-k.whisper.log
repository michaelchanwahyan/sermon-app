[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:39.920]   Love it.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.560]   There were row machines at the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.760]   Welcome, friends of Dallas.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.800]   Welcome, friends of Fort Worth.
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.720]   Do you guys remember homecoming dances in high school?
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.320]   Remember these?
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.480]   Yeah?
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.400]   Hopefully, good memories associated with these.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.360]   I'm going to tell one of my more memorable homecoming
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.080]   experiences that will kind of give us direction for where
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.720]   we're going.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.640]   My senior year, I had a girl that
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800]   was a friend named Lauren, total friend.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000]   She was in the friend zone, which is the zone you get put
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.600]   in--
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940]   I don't even really know how you put in there,
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.720]   but it's just like a mutual understanding.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.360]   This is platonic for life.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.480]   And she was in that zone.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.280]   Her name was Lauren.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.360]   And we were good friends, longtime friends.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420]   And we had said that if we didn't ever
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.020]   go to a dance that our senior year,
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.640]   we would go to homecoming together.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280]   And so this was like a conversation
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.680]   at the beginning in August or September of senior year,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.920]   just casual kind of, oh, yeah, we've never gone.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.760]   We should do that.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah, that would be fun.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.800]   Move on from there.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.600]   So that was the extent of the conversation.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.720]   So fast forward, life is going on.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.140]   We're still just friends totally.
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.520]   And all of a sudden, October rolls around.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.760]   Dance is one month away.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.240]   And I start dating another girl named Amanda, or talking
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880]   was what we called it back then.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   I don't know if you can call it dating
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.040]   if you live with your mom.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.920]   Just food for thought.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.000]   So I was living, and I was talking with Amanda.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.880]   And this is going on.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.760]   And I totally forget about this commitment
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.240]   that I had already previously made.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.960]   So of course, homecoming's a month away.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   What am I going to do?
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.200]   I do what you do for homecoming.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.720]   You make a cake, and you put a homecoming question mark on it.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.920]   And you give it to your date.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.480]   And I did this to Amanda.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.000]   And I was like, hey, do you want to go to homecoming?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.800]   This is so great.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.240]   And she said yes.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.320]   And so we're going to homecoming.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.600]   Little did I know, though I had forgot,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.240]   Lauren had not forgot.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.880]   And all of a sudden, word gets to me through the grapevine
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.480]   that, oh man, you need to call Lauren.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.440]   You're an idiot.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   And so I call Lauren.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.560]   She's crying.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.680]   And she's like, I can't believe you would do this.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.380]   I know.
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.600]   This is so terrible.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.360]   I'm losing all credibility up front.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.220]   So I call Lauren.
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.120]   And I'm like, oh no, this is--
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.560]   I can't believe you would do that.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.480]   And I'm like, don't worry.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.520]   I'm going to make this right.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.940]   I'm going to call you right back.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.200]   So I call my best friend in the world.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.960]   I can't believe this is so embarrassing.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.720]   I call my best friend.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.400]   His name is Wes.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.040]   And I'm like, Wes, I'm in a little bit of a pickle.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680]   And I need you to do me a solid.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.600]   So here's the deal, buddy.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.440]   And he's like, yeah, what is it?
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.720]   I say, so it turns out I have two dates to homecoming.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.440]   And I believe you have none.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.320]   And so I need you to take Lauren to homecoming for me.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.960]   And he's like, I'm not taking Lauren.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   I barely know her.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.000]   I don't want to go to homecoming.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.720]   Look, and I go into like selling mode.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.000]   Hey, it's going to be great.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.880]   We're going to make memories.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.760]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680]   I'm going to buy your ticket.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.640]   I'm going to buy both tickets.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.120]   I'm going to buy tickets for homecoming.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.700]   We're going to go.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.480]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.320]   He's like, I'm not going.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.400]   I'm going to buy your mom.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.320]   You remember moms?
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.360]   I can't believe I actually did this.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.200]   And you're like, what's a mom?
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.840]   A mom is like a $70 ribbon for some reason.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.440]   But I'm like, I'm going to buy your mom.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   It's from the both of us.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   I'm going to buy your mom.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.040]   It's going to be awesome.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.880]   I need you to do it.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.160]   I'll pay you back with some favor.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.680]   And he agrees to do it.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.640]   I call Lauren back.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.880]   I'm like, hey, problem solved.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.720]   I got you a date.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   She's like, what am I, a charity case?
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.960]   No, I'm not going to homecoming with him, you, or anyone.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.480]   I get a call from Amanda in the middle of this, who now
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.520]   has heard about the fiasco.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.000]   Hey, I got to call you back, Lauren.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   Hey, Amanda, how's it going?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   She's now crying and begins to say, you asked me to homecoming
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.480]   and you already had a date?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.840]   And I'm like, that feels like a little hard negative
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.120]   interpretation of what happened.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.800]   It was something close to that, but I don't know exactly.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.440]   And she's like, I'm not going to homecoming with you.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.360]   You can go with Lauren.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   I'm not going.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.920]   So I went from two dates to no dates.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.160]   Finally, after some great group conflict resolution,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.880]   we all ended up going together, which
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.440]   made for a really interesting dinner conversation of like,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.880]   this is really awkward.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.480]   And it was one of those moments where it was like, oh my gosh,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.640]   David, you are an idiot.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.640]   Like still to this day, when I talk--
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.200]   because we're all still friends, and I'll talk to them.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.680]   And they'll be like, hey, remember that one time
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.320]   that you asked me to homecoming and then you
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   asked somebody else?
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.000]   Then you paid your best friend to take me to homecoming?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.160]   It's like, wow, someone holds a grudge.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.040]   Ever heard of forgiveness?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.400]   You should try it.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.480]   But it's still like, just to this day, one of those things
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.200]   we look back on in life.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.660]   And here's where I start with that,
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.640]   fast forward in life, and a few years or 10 years or so later,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   I'm now married.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   And while we look back, and that's kind of funny,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   and how could you do that?
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.760]   I know, I'm an idiot.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.320]   But now, 10 years later, I'm married.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.160]   I've been married three years.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.440]   We actually have one on the way.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.480]   I don't know if I've ever said that here.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.520]   Yeah, get excited.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.440]   And-- yeah, thank you.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.560]   It's important.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.080]   And now that I'm married, if I was to do something very
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.040]   similar, it wouldn't be funny.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.480]   I would get booed off the stage.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.440]   I would not be allowed to preach it.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.680]   In other words, if I, like, last night, it was date night,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.000]   and I'm like, hey, you know, ever
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.720]   since you got pregnant, morning sickness has made you really
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   not fun for dates.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.200]   So I'm going to take Jennifer on a date.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.760]   Everyone would go, even if it's kind of funny,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.120]   it's only funny because hopefully it's not true, right?
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   Because we'd all go, that's not funny.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.280]   That's adultery.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.200]   Like, that's unfaithfulness.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.040]   You're married.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.080]   And the reason I start there is because tonight,
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   when it comes to the topic of adultery,
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.360]   and kind of where we would draw the line on what
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.800]   would be inappropriate, what would be wrong,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.000]   Jesus begins to open the discussion on the Sermon
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.520]   on the Mount, which is what we're diving into all summer
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.800]   long, where he begins to say, the line you've drawn,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.000]   all of you--
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.480]   me, his audience then, our culture, our room right here--
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.760]   all of you have drawn a line as it relates to adultery,
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.160]   and it's in the wrong place.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.920]   It's nowhere near as far back as it was always intended to be.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.840]   You think just because you're not married,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.640]   it may not be adultery.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.000]   Just because you don't have sex, it may not be adultery.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   And he begins to say, you don't understand adultery.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.080]   You don't understand the intent of that law.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.680]   And he's going to redefine it for us.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.000]   And not only that, he's going to say, the consequences,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.200]   if you don't understand where that line is--
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400]   and most of us go, I've never committed adultery.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.920]   That probably goes-- and the strict definition of it,
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.360]   society-wise, would probably say, no, I've never committed
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.720]   adultery.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.240]   And Jesus is going to say, you don't
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.880]   understand what adultery is.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.440]   He backs up the line and says, not understanding it
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.040]   has consequences for this life and eternal life.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.760]   So we're going to be in Matthew chapter 5.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.920]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Matthew.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.840]   It's the very first book in the New Testament.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.280]   If you hit Psalms, just keep going.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.520]   Kind of your right, you'll hit Matthew.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.240]   We're going to be in chapter 5 as we explore the most famous
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.640]   sermon in human history, a sermon that
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.880]   has been quoted more by politicians, more by people
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.920]   than any other message in history, the message actually
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920]   that changed Gandhi.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.560]   Remember Gandhi?
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.800]   It was a sermon on the Mount.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.480]   It changed my life.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.320]   And really, we explore the message, the very first
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.560]   message Jesus ever gave.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.400]   Last week, JP talked about anger.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.720]   And the whole sermon on the Mount, for large parts of it,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.920]   Jesus comes in and says, you think if you don't murder,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.040]   then you're not a murderer.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.080]   But I tell you, if you have anger in your heart,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.240]   it's the same sin.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.280]   And he begins to raise the standard,
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.080]   elevate, Jesus says, the law to where it was always
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.240]   intended to be.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.920]   Tonight, he's going to explore the topic of sexual sin
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.640]   or adultery and lust.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.360]   So we're going to look at Jesus's redefining of adultery,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.000]   his instructions to remove adultery.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.040]   And you'll begin to see what I'm talking about.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.320]   And then his, really, words as it
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.080]   relates to remarriage and adultery,
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   redefining, removing, and remarriage and adultery.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.600]   We're going to pick it up in verse 27.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.880]   And we'll get started.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.120]   He's gathering on a hillside.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.460]   There's a crowd in front of him.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.200]   And he begins to teach the very first message he would ever
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.920]   give.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   You have heard it said, Jesus speaking,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.800]   you've heard that it was said, you shall not commit adultery.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.080]   So his audience is going, yeah, that's not a good thing.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.040]   Adultery, sleeping with someone else's husband
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.720]   or someone else's wife, not a good thing.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.560]   It's a commandment.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.280]   But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman or a man
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.400]   lustfully has already committed adultery
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.440]   with her in his heart.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.940]   Jesus's first point, really, in this passage
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.920]   is redefining what adultery is.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.640]   He says, and he really said to his entire audience,
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.080]   you've heard it said, you shall not commit adultery.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.000]   But I mean, think about this.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.960]   We've kind of heard it.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.920]   It's kind of numb on us.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.800]   The Bible's like, oh, that's so mysterious.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.520]   To his audience, he just said, you've heard it said,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.440]   if you don't commit adultery, that's OK.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.160]   I tell you, if you lust after anyone, you're an adulterer.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.440]   And his audience is going, what?
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.120]   Jesus, you are so intense.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.680]   If I have lust in my heart, if I look lustfully after someone,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.520]   I'm an adulterer?
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.000]   What do you mean by lust?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.740]   The word he uses is really just the word for strongly desire,
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.020]   to look at someone, a guy or a girl, and say, I want you.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.740]   I strongly desire that person, someone
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.780]   who's not your spouse.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.900]   Jesus says, when that moment comes,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.300]   you've crossed the line, David, porch of adultery.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.060]   You don't understand what adultery is.
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.700]   He says, it's not a matter of the hands.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.060]   It's a matter of the heart.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.420]   And I think what is interesting further
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.980]   is that Jesus answers the question for all of us
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.360]   and probably most of us have asked it.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.520]   Hey, how far is too far?
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.080]   That's what Jesus just gave us the answer to.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   Hey, how far is too far?
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.720]   Me and Sally, we're dating, can we kiss?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.560]   Can we use tongue?
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.380]   What's the problem?
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.220]   How far is too far?
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.580]   And Jesus says, hey, look, let me tell you how far it is.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.280]   The moment you lust after someone, it's too far.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.480]   You've committed adultery.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.840]   Jesus, that's so intense.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.160]   You're calling me an adulterer?
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.360]   And I think what's hard about adultery
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.920]   or hard about lust, which is Jesus would say, same thing,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.420]   is that it masks itself in curiosity.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.500]   Have you noticed this?
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.620]   Like it masks itself in like,
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.380]   huh, I wonder who this person is.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.300]   Hmm, do I know them?
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.780]   It masks itself in curiosity.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.380]   Girls, maybe you're flipping through Instagram
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.180]   and you're like, oh, who is this guy with a 12 pack?
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.460]   I didn't even know we had that many abs.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.940]   I need to click to make sure I counted correctly here.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.260]   It masks itself in curiosity.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.540]   Or like on Facebook, where you're like,
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.140]   oh, look, photo albums.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.380]   Hmm, Cancun 2012.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.960]   Wonder what that is, a little mission trip maybe?
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.360]   I don't know what this could be, huh?
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.720]   Let me just see what, I'm sure they're serving the Lord.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.340]   It masks itself in curiosity.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.080]   And Jesus says, look, you may fool yourself.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.440]   You're not fooling me.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   That's adultery.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.400]   Anytime that you entertain that bikini picture,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.240]   that picture just in general
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.920]   of looking after someone with lust, I want you.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.380]   Married or not married.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.120]   He says you've crossed the line into adultery.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.320]   It's not just having the act of sexual intercourse.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.120]   It starts way, way, way before that.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   So don't think you're off the hook.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.560]   He would say to me and say to you.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.760]   Say to his audience then.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.840]   I think it's so hard for me to reconcile this
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   because like a week ago, a really well-known pastor,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.160]   a guy with a huge platform and a successful author,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.760]   a young guy, really lots of influence.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   A guy that we've had speak here at Watermark multiple times.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.720]   Came out and he basically said, I've been having an affair
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.280]   and I'm stepping down from ministry.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.320]   And when you're in ministry, like myself,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.960]   or I just remember JP sent me that article
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.800]   and it's kind of one of those mixed moments
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.680]   where you're like, man, heartbroken,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   another one bites the dust.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.240]   And then this feeling goes through my heart
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.040]   of just really honestly judgmental.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.160]   I'm going, how could you do that?
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.120]   How could you forfeit this platform that God's given you?
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.800]   And what's sad about that, and I'm not saying that
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.880]   to throw him under the bus as much as I am to say this,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.000]   just a few hours before that,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.560]   I was in the kitchen and I was washing dishes
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.840]   and my wife was in the other room
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.960]   and I'm washing dishes in the sink
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.640]   and there's a window that faces our front yard.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.880]   It's like six o'clock at night, Sunday night.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.720]   And I'm washing dishes, she's in there watching,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.640]   I don't know what she was watching,
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.720]   but I'm washing dishes, she's husband of the year award
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.800]   and I am self-awarded.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.600]   And I'm washing dishes and I'm looking out the front window
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   and all of a sudden this young woman walks by my window
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.800]   and wearing very short shorts, Jenny the jogger,
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.120]   shows up with her dog and she's walking by
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.320]   and her dog relieves himself and she,
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.480]   right straight, and like Satan, I know what,
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.400]   right straight in my view, bends over in front of me
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.000]   and my first thought was not, oh my gosh, look away.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.720]   It was, who is that?
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.040]   She must work out.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   My first thought wasn't, wasn't,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.520]   hey, I know who that is, that's not my wife.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.480]   And Jesus says in that moment when you go, wow,
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.980]   lust, adultery.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.480]   And that same part of my heart that was going,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.120]   oh my gosh, how could you do that,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.760]   totally in Jesus goes, how could you do that?
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.520]   That's the same sin, you may not make national news,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.120]   it's the same sin and you don't fool me, David.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.400]   That's adultery.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.840]   And really, if this wasn't bad enough,
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.360]   Jesus, his audience, I'm telling you,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.520]   if you're hearing this for the first time,
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.720]   you're like, man, this guy's intense, go back to carpentry.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.120]   This is not a fun sermon to hear,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.000]   not a feel good for the message in the crowd,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.520]   but it really almost gets worse, he keeps going.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.480]   And if your right eye causes you to stumble,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.400]   gouge it out and throw it away.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.560]   I'm gonna read it like they would have heard it
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   'cause Jesus moves through.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.120]   And if your right eye causes you to stumble,
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.840]   gouge it out and throw it away.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.600]   It's better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.120]   than for the whole body to be thrown in hell.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.560]   Wait, gouge it out?
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.280]   Take my eye, if I'm tempted to lust,
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.400]   you want me to gouge out my eye, throw it away?
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.880]   Where do you throw an eyeball away?
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.760]   That's what you want me to do?
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.480]   I have to become Cyclops to follow Jesus?
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.280]   Yeah, and if your right hand causes you to stumble,
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.560]   cut it off and throw it away.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.440]   Now you have two limbs,
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.560]   you have to figure out where to throw it away.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.840]   And it's better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.040]   than for the whole body to go into hell.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.960]   Amputation, Jesus, really?
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.600]   Is that what we're talking about?
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.000]   What does he mean?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.400]   Well, he doesn't mean amputation
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.000]   because you still have one other hand.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.480]   What he's saying is not, hey, you need to amputate,
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.320]   it's eliminate.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.600]   Here's what Jesus tells us
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.560]   about the topic of our second point, removing adultery.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.880]   Sexual sin is serious, Jesus says.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.120]   I want you to take extreme measures.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.920]   I want you to go to extremes,
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.600]   which is what the hyperbole of cutting off your arm
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.840]   or gouge out in your eye.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.120]   If you think he really means that,
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.160]   I wouldn't die on that hill,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.280]   and so better for you
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.560]   if you think you should really cut it off.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.280]   I think more scholars would say he's saying extreme,
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.160]   take extreme measures, eliminate.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.080]   It's not about amputate, it's about eliminating,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.120]   removing access.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.080]   Sexual sin is serious.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.680]   Kill it before it's killing you.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.800]   Take extreme measures to remove access.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.120]   I think in our culture, everywhere that you look,
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.480]   this is so huge for the church
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.800]   because everywhere in terms of the sexual morality
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.720]   that you and I are exposed to
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.800]   or the temptation towards sexuality is everywhere.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.000]   Everywhere you look,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.480]   everything is trying to sell stuff through sex.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.240]   It used to be just like Maxim.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.600]   Now it's like Wheaties boxes are low cut
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.120]   and everywhere that you look,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   our society is baiting you to the edge of sexual disaster.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.080]   When Jesus says be extreme,
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.400]   the music that you listen to,
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.000]   if it's gonna lead you down that road,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.960]   change the station, turn off the music.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.840]   Beyonce, Queen Bee has done more to put forward
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.800]   just a tainted wrong view of sexuality
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.760]   than any other artist that I know of.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   That's a female, probably be the best way to say it.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.720]   Movies, you can't go to movies anymore
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.040]   without being exposed to pornography.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.760]   You don't have to have a computer, you can see it
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.400]   in movies that are popular and common.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.920]   In fact, here's a way to remove access,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.360]   guys, especially who are perverts like me,
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.960]   write this down, pluggedin.com.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.800]   If you wanna know where you can go to find out,
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.520]   is this movie gonna expose me to something
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   that Jesus says, cut it off, remove it.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.400]   Pluggedin.com, pluggedin.com.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.840]   Be extreme, he would say.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.280]   Delete the phone number of that late night person you call
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.240]   that ends up hooking up with.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.680]   Delete the number.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.720]   Do whatever you have to to remove access.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.280]   Pornography is out of control in our country.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.760]   The porn industry in the United States
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.120]   makes more money than professional baseball,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.480]   basketball, and football combined.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.080]   Is it no wonder that rape is out of control?
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.000]   It's more common to be raped than to be a smoker.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.840]   And all of us, our society's like, yeah, sex, sex, sex,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.000]   while it wreaks havoc in our lives.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Pornography, if you struggle with porn,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.920]   he would say, get rid of the computer.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.360]   Get rid of the smartphone, get a flip phone.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.480]   I don't know why that's funny.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.440]   He had a razor, oh my gosh.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.120]   I don't know why that's funny.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.520]   Take extreme measures, Covenantize.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.440]   Guys, I'm just, this message brought to you by Covenantize.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.280]   If you don't have Covenantize, I think you're crazy.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.420]   I've had it for a decade.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.680]   I counted up the amount of money.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.280]   Covenantize is software you put on your computer
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   and any mobile device you have.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.760]   It helps monitor so that you aren't led down the road
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.000]   towards pornographic material in any sense.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.800]   If you don't have Covenantize, I think you're crazy.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.360]   I counted up.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.400]   I've spent $1,200 in the last 10 years.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.320]   The best investment I've ever made.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.600]   10 bucks a month, message brought to you by Covenantize.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.440]   Moving on.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.780]   Get Covenantize if you're a guy or a lady, across the board.
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.280]   But do whatever you have to, Jesus says,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.120]   remove access to sexual sin.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.360]   And he doesn't say this because God is against sex.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.520]   God is the most pro-sex being on the planet.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.500]   God invented it.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.200]   That's like Steve Jobs being against the iPhone.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.140]   God invented sex.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.720]   There wasn't sex and God was like, I got an idea.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.920]   How about this?
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.680]   God is the one who made it.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.640]   God is pro-sex and here's further why it's not about him
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.600]   being against sex.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.220]   It's because he's pro you.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.880]   He didn't just want you to remove sexuality
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.400]   'cause he's like, I hate fun.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.800]   He wants to remove sexuality because he knows the power
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.640]   of sex.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.040]   He gave this amazing and incredible gift to man.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.780]   But it was a gift given to be used in a very specific place.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.720]   A marriage between a man and a woman.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.400]   He said, look, I'm gonna give this gift
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.960]   and here's what sexuality's gonna do.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.640]   It's gonna unite the man and the woman together.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.400]   And inside of that one context, marriage,
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.880]   it has the power to bring them together
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.080]   and I'm gonna give them this powerful gift.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.800]   But outside of that context, it can be incredibly
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.960]   and will be incredibly destructive
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.940]   towards anything that it touches.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.200]   It's like fire.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.060]   Like, honestly, like a fireplace.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.080]   Like if you have a fireplace,
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.000]   a fire in the fireplace in the winter is awesome, right?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.660]   You're like, oh man, this is so great.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.300]   But when fire is ravaging through your living room,
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.640]   it's not awesome when it's burning down the house.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.660]   And God says, just like fire is great in the fireplace,
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.940]   not great in the living room.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.920]   Sex was intended, this powerful thing that touches you
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.720]   with the soul for marriage.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.480]   And in that context, and I'm not anti-sex,
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.180]   I'm pro-sex and I'm pro you.
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.700]   So do whatever you have to to remove access,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.520]   to remove sexual sin from your life.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.140]   And the reason I think he's so passionate about this,
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.280]   like be killing it or it will kill you,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.740]   is 'cause here's what I know about sexual sin.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.560]   After so many different conversations down front
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.400]   with lots of you guys, just with young adults
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.960]   for the past eight years,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.320]   sexual sin, unlike really any other sin that I know of,
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   or very few, kills relationships.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.860]   And it specifically kills two types of relationships.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.980]   The first one is your relationship with God.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.780]   If you're in sexual sin right now, you've known this.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.660]   It creates a fog, a darkness in your life.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.860]   And God says, I don't want you to experience that.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.060]   I want you to have a relationship with me at a deep level.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.820]   This is why at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.860]   here's what Jesus said.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.320]   Here's how we know that purity or lack of purity
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.780]   impacts your relationship with God.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.660]   He says, "Blessed are the pure in heart."
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.440]   Here's why, they're gonna see God.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.040]   "Blessed are those who are pure on the inside,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.200]   "and their purity on the inside will impact
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.620]   "their ability to see God on the outside."
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.540]   Not just in heaven, in this life.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.080]   If you're walking through and in the darkness
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.600]   of sexual sin, you don't stand condemned here,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.520]   but you do stand called into the light
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.960]   because God wants you to experience
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.600]   deep relationship with him, and he knows that purity
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.380]   your lack of purity or purity of mind and heart
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.860]   impacts your ability to see God at work.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.180]   He says, "Blessed are the pure in heart."
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.060]   They're gonna see God.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.740]   They're gonna see him in this world.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.080]   They're gonna see him at work in their life.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.920]   They're gonna see him at work around them.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.980]   It impacts your relationship, sexual sin,
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.540]   like few things I know of.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.020]   He says, "I have so much more for you."
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.940]   The second relationships it kills, this is no mystery.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.660]   It's just your relationship with the person
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.760]   you're having sex with.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.300]   Casual sex is just empty.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.740]   One night stands, it's empty.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.900]   It ends up being like, I would never marry you.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.420]   Dating someone, you introduce sex,
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.340]   it always gets more complicated.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.340]   And God who loves you says, "I've given this incredible gift
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.720]   "for marriage, for this one context,
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.800]   "and if you let it just like a fire into the living room,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.940]   "it's gonna destroy everything it touches.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.120]   "But inside of where it was created for,
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.160]   "it brings life, unity, and all the things
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.500]   "that I want you to experience
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.060]   "in your relationship with your spouse.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.520]   "So do whatever you have to to remove access."
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.840]   And he really finishes,
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.800]   and he goes into the third idea in this passage,
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.720]   which is remarriage and adultery.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.200]   It has been said, anyone who divorces his wife
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.800]   must give her a certificate of divorce.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:51.480]   But I tell you, and so they're going, oh no, buckle up,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.080]   that anyone who divorces his wife,
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.080]   except for sexual morality,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.860]   makes her the victim of adultery.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.860]   And anyone who marries a divorced woman or man
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.760]   commits adultery.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.680]   Jesus says, if someone is married,
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.880]   and they divorce, and they get remarried,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.000]   they commit adultery.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.440]   And his audience is going, what, Jesus,
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.260]   I don't think you understand what you're saying.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.480]   If someone is married, and they get divorced,
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.840]   and then they get remarried to a new spouse,
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.160]   that's not adultery, that's just a new marriage.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.080]   And Jesus would say,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.120]   that's 'cause you don't understand marriage.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.360]   Really, he indicates more clearly why
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.060]   if you divorce and marry someone else, it's adultery.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.840]   In Matthew 19, a few chapters later,
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.200]   where he is asked this exact question
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.880]   as it related to, hey, what are the circumstances
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   it's okay to divorce and remarry?
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.280]   And I want you to listen to his answer.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.400]   I don't even know if this is on the screen,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.900]   but I'm gonna read it.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.640]   Matthew 19, the question,
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.060]   when is it permissible and okay to divorce?
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   Verse four, haven't you read, he replied, Jesus speaking,
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.980]   that at the beginning,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.800]   the creator made them male and female.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.860]   And he said, for this reason,
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.100]   a man will leave his father and mother
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.260]   and be united to his wife,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:21.980]   and the two will become one flesh.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.260]   So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.580]   Therefore, what God has joined together,
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.740]   let no one separate.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.860]   In a word, what is Jesus' answer
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.780]   to is divorce okay?
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:39.560]   No.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.620]   Is it permissible?
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.080]   He says, I don't even know if it's possible,
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.100]   because here's what the Bible teaches about marriage.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.380]   Here's why this is such a crazy idea
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.540]   and hard for me to understand,
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.380]   'cause he was like, 'cause you don't understand
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.720]   fully marriage, David.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.580]   It doesn't say that the pursuit,
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.940]   and we use this language all the time,
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.380]   and I think it's a good, sticky statement.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.260]   The pursuit of marriage is oneness.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.100]   The Bible doesn't teach that,
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.020]   although that's a good thing.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.680]   It says the result of marriage is one flesh.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.380]   The result of not just you standing at the altar
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.580]   in a tux and a white dress,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.380]   but when you and that other person,
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.200]   when you and your spouse-to-be
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.760]   commit your lives to one another,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.660]   God is the active agent, God joins together.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.260]   And the two, he says, become one.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.900]   That's why when a person goes
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.420]   and tries to marry someone else,
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.840]   they commit adultery,
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.420]   because God says, you're still one flesh over here.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.220]   You may have a divorce paper.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.500]   The court may have said, yeah, it's over.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.400]   But I didn't recognize it, God says.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.860]   There's a permanence to marriage.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.120]   And so Jesus' audience, of course, is flabbergasted
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:54.600]   that it's not just a ceremony and a honeymoon,
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.500]   but a lifelong commitment.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.620]   But did Jesus just give an out, sexual morality?
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.180]   Did he create an exception except for sexual morality?
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.020]   I'm gonna move really quickly through this.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.660]   There's two camps on this discussion,
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.420]   and so I'll try to give real quick layups for both of them.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.660]   There's resources on the Porch blog.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.140]   There's actually messages that have been done
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.860]   at Watermark Media, and I'd encourage you
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.140]   to go check this out, but there's two camps.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.220]   Did he just give an out?
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.860]   So marriage is permanent
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.900]   unless they committed sexual morality.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.860]   There's two camps.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.660]   One of them would say, good people on both sides.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.780]   One of them would say, yes, he just gave an out.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.180]   And the other would say, no, that's not an out.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.500]   And you may think, how could they not think?
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.180]   It says, accept sexual morality.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.020]   Here's why.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.660]   Because the other two places this passage is mentioned
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.100]   in the New Testament, Mark and Luke,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.020]   accept sexual morality is not included.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.220]   It's not in there.
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.620]   That little part's left off.
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.540]   And which gospel would you prefer to read
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.380]   if you're reading Matthew's or Mark and Luke's?
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.820]   It's so permanent.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.260]   And so they think, no, no, no,
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.820]   it's referring to something in the Jewish culture,
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.260]   which Matthew is really heady, written to,
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.920]   and it relates to the betrothal period.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.620]   But there's good people on either side,
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.220]   but either way, that's something for you to wrestle through.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.240]   Am I saying that if you're divorced in this room,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.540]   or you're dating someone who's divorced,
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.820]   that you should not date someone
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.580]   other than your original spouse?
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.700]   Or if you marry someone other than your spouse,
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.940]   former spouse, you commit adultery.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:31.780]   Maybe.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.860]   What I'm for sure saying is that you need
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.940]   to really wrestle with that if that's a part of your story.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.180]   And we'd love to wrestle alongside of you with that.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.100]   And you may be going, what?
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.500]   I'm never going to marry that guy again.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.580]   I'm never going back to him.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.580]   He's a jerk, he's crazy, he was abusive, he was violent.
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.540]   She walked out, she was crazy,
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.940]   she slept with my best friend, all those different things.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.300]   And we would just say, would you be open
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.180]   to just praying for God to step in and act there?
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.780]   Which I know makes you go, no, she's,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.580]   I know she is off the deep end, or he was off the deep end.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.460]   There's no way, I know him, I lived with him,
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.460]   I was married to him, he's not changing.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.980]   And I, like you, my heart often, in cases like that,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.180]   here's what I am tempted to believe.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.700]   I put more belief or faith in sin
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.620]   than in Jesus' ability to change.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.020]   I put more faith when I believe that.
[00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:31.140]   I believe that, I believe my dad, at times,
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.900]   will never trust Christ.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.060]   And here's what I'm doing, I'm going,
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.940]   I believe, I have more faith in the power of sin
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.820]   than the power of Jesus to change.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.020]   And would you be open to just considering
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.260]   that maybe Jesus could change that person,
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.860]   as bad and crazy as it may seem?
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.060]   We see it all the time.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.940]   But bottom line, at least, minimum, wrestle with that issue.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.420]   Three things that are very clear about Jesus' teaching
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.380]   on marriage and adultery and remarriage
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.740]   is that marriage is a big deal to God.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.860]   And I think it's so important
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.300]   for this life stage specifically,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.540]   you guys, man, I want this so bad for you.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.980]   80% of you will get married in the next 10 years, 80%.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.060]   So everyone but this section, too bad,
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.860]   will get married.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.420]   And that's not actually true, but everyone,
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.060]   I don't know, I did it again, everyone but this section.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.380]   80% of you will get married in the next 10 years.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.660]   And what I think Jesus wants you to know and understand
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.740]   is there's something permanent going on with marriage.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.340]   It's not just a ring and a license.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.180]   It's so much deeper than that.
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.140]   And as you enter into dating, and here's what dating is,
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:48.980]   dating is a path that leads towards a promise.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.340]   That's you standing, white dress, tux,
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.500]   leads towards a promise
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.940]   that leads towards a lifelong pursuit.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   That's what dating is.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.820]   Dating is a path that leads towards a promise.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.540]   If you're not moving towards a promise, you're not dating.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.620]   You're just, I don't know what you're doing,
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.620]   but if you're not moving towards that promise, break up.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.420]   Dating is a path that moves towards a promise
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.900]   that leads towards a lifelong pursuit.
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.820]   And as you move towards that pursuit,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:17.700]   as you move towards that promise,
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.380]   Jesus would say, you need to know what you're getting into.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.380]   And if that scares you,
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.820]   that's probably, he would say, a good response.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.100]   At the end of the Matthew passage in Matthew 19,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.740]   his disciples were like, if that's the case,
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.860]   why would anyone want to get married?
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.700]   And Jesus doesn't correct them.
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.860]   He's like, all right.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.700]   Walks off.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.360]   Read it, Matthew 19 10.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.460]   But you need to know what you're getting into.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.780]   And the second thing that's very clear,
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.700]   and this isn't even in the Bible,
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.780]   we just look around and see this,
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.020]   is the destructiveness of divorce.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.460]   I mean, it's no mystery why God would hate divorce.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.320]   Look at the ripples of chaos just in our country.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.700]   Time Magazine in 2009 said,
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.380]   "There is no single force creating as much measurable
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.340]   "hardship and human misery in the United States
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.440]   "as divorce."
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:12.320]   And the culture around us welcomes it on,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.700]   puts an emphasis on getting married,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.880]   but not on staying married.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.340]   And it always, the price you pay for divorce is pain.
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.900]   And our world is not gonna say anything different.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.300]   They're gonna say, Kanye, we want prenup.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.680]   We want prenup.
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.520]   All right?
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.300]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.440]   And Jesus says, Kanye, you don't get marriage.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.060]   You don't understand what you're a part of.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.340]   I know the pain of divorce very personally.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.900]   My parents are divorced.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.700]   My wife's parents are divorced.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.780]   My sister's divorced.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:48.780]   And I feel the scars at every holiday, every graduation.
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.860]   I feel the pain of having to do everything twice.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.520]   And God says to all of us, humanity,
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.540]   it was never intended to be this way.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.280]   It was never intended to be this way.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.200]   The third reason I think,
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.600]   or the reason it's such a big deal, marriage to God,
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.080]   is not just 'cause the pain it brings,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.520]   but because marriage ultimately is a metaphor.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.960]   Like, that's what marriage is.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.880]   And I'm like, I get so focused on,
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.920]   yeah, it's me and my wife, it's awesome, this is great.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.420]   And God's like, marriage is a picture.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.920]   I'm giving you this picture, and it's a metaphor.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.160]   Here's what it's a metaphor.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.100]   Ephesians 5, you can read this in 30 through 32 later,
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.440]   but where Paul basically says,
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.560]   hey, for this reason, a man will leave his father and mother
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.760]   and be united to his wife,
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.880]   and the two will become one flesh.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.160]   And then he says this, I love this,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.200]   say it at every wedding I do.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.980]   This is a profound mystery.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.440]   Yeah, Paul, that is mysterious, two becoming one.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.480]   And then he says, but I'm talking about Christ
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.560]   and the church, that's what marriage is about.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.320]   That marriage ultimately is a picture of God's unending,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.720]   unstoppable, unbreakable love and covenant with his people,
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.680]   his church, his bride.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.680]   That's what marriage is.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.440]   That's what marriage is ultimately about, God's love.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.080]   And that's why he takes it so seriously,
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.920]   because he says, I'll never give up on my bride.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.880]   I'll keep chasing, I'll keep pursuing, I'll never stop.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.940]   And that's what I want marriage,
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.960]   human marriage to reflect and be about.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:27.680]   I think there's two responses to this room,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.940]   or to this message in this room.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.900]   And the first one is shame.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:39.680]   When you listen to Jesus's words, they're just so harsh.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.020]   Anyone who marries someone whose divorce commits adultery,
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:47.800]   if I look at someone lustfully, I'm an adulterer.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.240]   And the first one is shame.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.980]   And here's what I'm so convinced of.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.940]   And I hope you believe me.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.160]   And I don't know if you will.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.600]   Jesus was here, you wouldn't feel shame.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.300]   You wouldn't feel condemned.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:08.560]   He said, I didn't come to shame you, I came to save you.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.100]   You don't need my help for shame.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.740]   I came to save.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:15.440]   There's a woman, the most beautiful picture of this
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.420]   that I know you would not, if you've had that
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.020]   in your past, feel condemned.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.820]   If Jesus was here, it was in John chapter eight.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.220]   You're gonna read the story later,
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.920]   where a woman who was caught having sex
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.300]   with a man who was not her husband.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.060]   A woman, she's having sex, she's married,
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.740]   she's having sex with another man,
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.700]   and she's caught in the act.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.020]   And Jesus is at the temple, it's early one morning,
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.780]   he's teaching the people.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.600]   And they drag her in, this group of Pharisees,
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   the Bible says, and they throw her in front of Jesus.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.920]   And they say, we just found this woman having sex
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.760]   with a man who wasn't her husband.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.440]   And they begin calling for the death penalty.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.480]   So the law says, Jesus, what do you say?
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:59.200]   Jesus, God in flesh, he bends down
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.000]   and begins a really bizarre and peculiar action.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.600]   He begins writing in the sand.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.000]   We don't know what he wrote.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.500]   And after a couple moments, he looks up and he says,
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:14.900]   let the one without sin be the first one to throw the stone.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.220]   And then he bends back down and keeps writing.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.620]   And the Bible says, one by one, the men went off
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:28.820]   until it was just the woman and the Son of God bending down.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:35.300]   And Jesus then looks up and he says this.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.600]   Jesus straightened up and asked her,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   verse 10, chapter eight, woman, where are they?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.000]   Has no one condemned you?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.980]   What is the Son of God going to say
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.620]   to the woman caught in adultery,
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.620]   caught in the midst of sexual sin,
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.180]   caught going against the law,
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.700]   to the man caught looking at pornography
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.820]   late during the internet or at work?
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.220]   What is he gonna say to the person
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.160]   who sleeps with that coworker, who's not their spouse,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.460]   who's someone else's spouse on that business trip,
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.900]   to the man walking out of the strip club?
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.700]   What is the Son of God, perfect righteousness gonna say?
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:17.140]   They don't condemn you, neither do I condemn you.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.580]   And then he says, and not only do I not condemn you,
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.220]   but here's what you need to know.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.420]   Go and leave your life of sin.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.140]   I don't condone it.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.740]   Sometimes we swing too far and we're like,
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.580]   no, there's no, we don't condemn.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.740]   That's fine, do whatever you want.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.680]   And Jesus says, I don't condemn and I don't condone,
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.260]   but I'm perfect righteousness, God in a bod,
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.860]   and I'm standing before you looking eyeball to eyeball,
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:44.900]   woman who just had sex with a man who wasn't her husband.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.160]   And I don't condemn you, but I have so much more for you.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:56.380]   Go, daughter, leave this.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.040]   I have so much more for you.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.700]   And the second flawed response
[00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.700]   is that we won't take sexual sin and marriage serious enough
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.900]   that we'll listen and just go,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.260]   ah, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.740]   And Jesus says, kill it before it kills you
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.580]   and brings you to that dark place,
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.660]   brings you to that place where your relationship with God
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.220]   just feels in this dark place,
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.660]   your relationships with others, your future spouse, kill it.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.720]   What does it look like to take sin seriously for the guys?
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.500]   I think that looks like you may need
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.260]   to get rid of your computer.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.080]   If you're having a porn problem, you come down front,
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.680]   this always happens where it's like,
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.520]   I'm trying to quit looking at porn.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.880]   Good, where's your computer?
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.720]   Well, it's at my house.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.940]   Good, where's your phone?
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.900]   Well, here it is, it's an iPhone, iPhone 6 Plus.
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.980]   And they pull it out and it's like,
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:51.720]   look, you gotta get rid of those things.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.120]   You gotta get covenantized.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.100]   Taking steps towards removing those things,
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.840]   it's playing with fire and will bring destruction.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.940]   It means leading purely in relationships,
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.980]   leading out impurity in your dating relationships,
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.940]   taking sexual sin seriously, girls,
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.980]   I think it looks like you're watching
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.860]   your intake on the bachelor and the bachelorette.
[00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.260]   And I'm not going into that here, that's for you.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.060]   But if you allow the bachelor
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.200]   to inform what you're looking for,
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.360]   inform what you're expecting,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   it's going to lead down the same destructive path
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   you can check out at seven o'clock on ABC
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.320]   every Monday night.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.640]   It's true.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.860]   You may need to get rid of Cosmo Magazine.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.000]   50 Shades of Grey, watch what you're taking in.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.640]   And second area is you can help the guys in this room
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.200]   who are perverts like me by dressing modestly,
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.660]   by dressing modestly, because we need your help.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.940]   And you may be going, look, that's their problem.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.600]   If they are lusting after me, that's their problem.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.000]   And yes, it is our problem.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   We're inviting you to help.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:03.840]   And you may be going, look,
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.040]   no matter what I wear, they could lust.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.380]   I could be in an astronaut suit.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.880]   Maybe like, oh, where you at, girl?
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.200]   Astronaut, okay.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.520]   It's true, it is true.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.200]   So Jesus said, I want your heart,
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.880]   but you can help us right now.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.460]   And here's where I think the church,
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.520]   we always get this wrong,
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.400]   'cause we're like, yeah, modest is hottest,
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.480]   but not really.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.820]   Ha ha, we always get it wrong.
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.460]   Here's what I mean by modest.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.580]   It's not dressing frumpy.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.300]   It's not wearing canvas bags.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.020]   It is dressing, the best definition I know of,
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.860]   I stole from some other woman on this topic.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.340]   She said this, modesty is not about hiding your body.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.660]   It's about revealing your dignity.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.540]   Modesty is not about a woman hiding her body.
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.820]   It's about a woman revealing her dignity.
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.100]   And it's not dressing frumpily.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.320]   Be stylish, be crazy stylish.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.300]   But help your brothers in the room.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.740]   And the third area, just of a response
[00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.780]   I think we all have to do,
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.180]   especially if you don't know where you land,
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.180]   is wrestle with divorce and remarriage.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.660]   It's very clear what Jesus says as it relates to marriage.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.140]   The exception clause, you can wrestle with it yourself,
[00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.000]   but the permanence of it, Jesus says,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.300]   that's because marriage is a big deal to me.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.780]   I created it, God says.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.020]   You can invent divorce, which man did.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.660]   You can change rules, add rules,
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.660]   but in the beginning I created it.
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.420]   And it's mine, and it's a metaphor.
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.380]   And that's why I care so much about it.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:39.380]   The most well explained maybe example
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.460]   of how much God cares about marriage,
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.900]   of how marriage is really just this picture, he says,
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.580]   of his love for the church is this book called Hosea.
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.980]   It's in the Old Testament, and it's named Hosea.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.460]   And it's about this man named Hosea
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.380]   who was a prophet for the nation of Israel.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.860]   And prophets during that time would be people
[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.180]   who God would come and say, hey,
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.500]   I'm gonna have you speak to the nation of Israel
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.140]   on my behalf.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.540]   And you might be going, oh, that's weird.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.120]   I mean, couldn't he have messed it up?
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.780]   What happened, if you were a prophet
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.540]   and you prophesied something that was wrong,
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:13.420]   they killed you.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.500]   And so not everyone was like,
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.140]   yeah, I wanna be a prophet when I grow up,
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.140]   because you would die if you didn't get it right.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.660]   And so Hosea is the prophet.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.140]   God says, I'm gonna have you speak.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.980]   And sometimes God would have the prophets,
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.820]   Jeremiah, Ezekiel, this is just in the Old Testament,
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.380]   if you ever wonder what those are about,
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.220]   those are the prophet books, prophetic books.
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.940]   And he'd have them do these like funny things.
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:33.820]   I'm gonna have you say this,
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:35.920]   and then I'm gonna have you live this way.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.340]   And Hosea was asked to do maybe the most peculiar
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.740]   of all the prophet actions.
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.580]   And here's what happened.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.780]   God comes to him, he says, Hosea,
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:46.900]   I want you to do something for me.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.860]   I want you to get married.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.660]   Hosea's like, awesome, cha-ching.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.340]   And God says, and I've already got her picked out for you.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:59.200]   She's a prostitute named Gomer.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.940]   And you're gonna have children of prostitution.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.340]   You wanna know if they're yours or not?
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.300]   She's gonna cheat on you over and over.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.220]   And from Hosea, I'm going, am I sure this is God?
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.180]   This sounds like the devil.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.660]   She didn't have a cool prostitute name, like cinnamon.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.620]   Gomer, really?
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.540]   He says, yeah.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.840]   And over and over.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.820]   I apologize, if your name is cinnamon,
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.140]   we honor you tonight.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.940]   No, not like that, but I like that name.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:37.820]   Kill in a moment.
[00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.640]   And God says this, and she's gonna over and over again,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.480]   cheat on you.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.500]   And I'm gonna put it in your heart, Hosea,
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.340]   in case you're going,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.500]   I don't know if I wanna do this.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.780]   I'm gonna put it in your heart, love for.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.460]   That you won't be able to stop.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.300]   Here's why, because you are gonna be a reflection
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.880]   of that's how I feel towards my people.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.060]   That they continually go after other lovers,
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.740]   and me, I love them, I won't stop pursuing them,
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.180]   I won't stop chasing them.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.100]   That's how God feels.
[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.260]   And he says, Hosea, that's how you're gonna display
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.000]   my love towards my people.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.420]   And Hosea marries Gomer, they have a couple kids.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.940]   And she keeps cheating on him.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.740]   She goes away, she sleeps with other people,
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.660]   and then she comes back.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:26.420]   And then one day, she doesn't come home.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.460]   This is in Hosea.
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:33.740]   And what happens is word gets to Hosea, where's my wife?
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.940]   And they say, she sold herself into sex slavery.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.820]   She's the property of someone else.
[00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.740]   She's a sex slave.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.940]   I mean, you gotta think how this feels for Hosea.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.380]   Hosea, that's like the pastor.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.820]   That's like me, you know, the head pastor of some,
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.740]   the lead minister, a very influential figure,
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.540]   and his wife is sleeping around all the time.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.220]   How does that work in society?
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.820]   Yeah, buddy, I bet you're a man of God.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.540]   And Hosea hears his wife has been sold into slavery,
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.940]   and he goes looking for her.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.340]   And he finds her inside of the city,
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.940]   and she's on an auction to be sold.
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.260]   And he goes up, and he says, that's my wife.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:15.940]   The auction continues, and it's like, this is her price.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.380]   And he goes, and he gets all the money that he has,
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.620]   and he sells property.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.020]   And he comes back, and he says, how much?
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:30.020]   How much for my wife, who keeps running away, how much?
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.260]   And the man says, this is the price.
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.740]   And he says, I'll pay it.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.580]   I'll pay it.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:42.580]   And God says, this picture is just like the love of the Lord.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:47.700]   It's just like the love of the Lord for his people.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.660]   Read it, Hosea chapter three, one through three in there.
[00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.020]   It says, just like my love for my people.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.260]   It never stops, it never ends.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.740]   It's the point of marriage.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.780]   Just like Hosea would pay that price,
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.780]   and in the verses that come after that in the book,
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.620]   here's what happens.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.540]   It speaks of a day.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.860]   It speaks of this day where God would look down
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.060]   at humanity, look down at the adulterers of humanity,
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.980]   me and you, those who had run after other gods,
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.620]   those who had turned their back on him,
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.260]   those who didn't trust him, who turned to pain pills,
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.940]   those who ran away through pornography,
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.220]   who slept with men that were not their husband,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.140]   who slept with women who were not their husband,
[00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.900]   cheated, stole, lied, women who turned their back.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   And he looks down at humanity, and he says, how much?
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.180]   What's the price, God says?
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.500]   My son?
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:39.540]   I'll pay it.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.460]   I'll pay it.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:47.260]   And it speaks of this day that that's what marriage is.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.140]   That you and I are Gomer, and God is Hosea,
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.260]   and he says, I'll pay it for my people,
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:58.860]   the adulterers, like you, David, and like you.
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.940]   On Friday, our world burst open
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.060]   with the saying that love wins.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.660]   With the saying that love wins.
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:10.740]   The day that love won.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.820]   And I'm not gonna address that right now.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.860]   We've got resources, and we will address it,
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.580]   but here's what I want you to know.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:21.420]   Not only do we not believe that was a day love won,
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.420]   that wasn't loving,
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.580]   but furthermore, that wasn't the day love won.
[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.260]   There was a day, it was 2,000 years ago on a hillside
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.380]   where God in the flesh became a man,
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:36.420]   and he died on a cross for you and for me,
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.860]   and every look at pornography,
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.100]   every act that you've ever done,
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:40.540]   every drug you've ever taken,
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.620]   every time you've ever lied,
[00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:42.940]   every time you've ever stolen,
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.980]   everything was poured on him, all of it.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:47.700]   That was the day love won.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.340]   That's when love wins.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:55.660]   Because Jesus wanted you to know it didn't happen in 2015.
[00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.020]   It happened at Calvary,
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.460]   where his love was displayed for his church, his people,
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.260]   and for you in the room.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.040]   If you've trusted in that, that's the day love won.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.820]   That's the only day love won.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:16.060]   And tonight, if you've never accepted the free gift,
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.220]   that's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.020]   You accept the free gift.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.140]   Jesus on the cross, he paid for everything I've done.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.920]   As bad as I think I am, or as good as I think I am,
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:30.140]   I'm trusting in myself, and I'm gonna trust in Jesus.
[00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:31.740]   He paid for it.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.480]   In that moment, love wins.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.520]   That's why we're passionate about getting the message out
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.280]   to a world that needs it.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.720]   There was a day love won.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.320]   There will be a day where all will see
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.440]   the gift of the God who through love wins.
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.840]   If you don't know that God, I'm gonna pray that you will,
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:56.640]   and we're gonna close as we worship.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.640]   Father, thank you that you love men and women,
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.640]   men like me who turn my back on you,
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.760]   who don't trust you,
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.720]   who chase after other idols who I am Gomer.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:16.240]   And yet in all of that, you say,
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.260]   I won't give up on my people.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.780]   I'll never stop loving and pursuing,
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:24.520]   and my love, if they will accept it, will win.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:30.000]   I ask now that by your spirit, would you win tonight?
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.780]   Would you win over sexual addiction?
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.160]   For my friends that believe that they'll never get out of it,
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.880]   that they would not have as much faith in their sin
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.920]   as they do in your son, Jesus, the power of Jesus.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.680]   We ask that you would win in the hearts
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.080]   of those who don't know you,
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.840]   and that you would show them the way that love wins,
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.120]   because love has a name, Jesus.
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.240]   We worship him now, and we love him.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.120]   Would you help us love him more?
