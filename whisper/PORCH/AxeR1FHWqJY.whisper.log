[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.160]   tonight the topic when I was prepping for the kickoff to RIP to the old me I'm
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.160]   not gonna lie I got a little sentimental because as I was just thinking about
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.240]   all the things that you know the old JD since we met the last time in 2021 and
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.600]   the JD you see before you is a completely new man I don't know if y'all
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.240]   notice but I got some bling on my finger and the token singleness guy of the
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:34.640]   porch is dead and gone he is and I left him in 2021 happily left him and I got to
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.040]   marry the woman of my dreams miss Jenna Rogers it has been such a gift but I'm
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.120]   not gonna lie like guys like we say all the time it's not just lip service
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.040]   singleness is awesome and part of me I mean yesterday we celebrated our one
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.320]   month of marriage and I'm still mourning a little bit of who I was I'm not gonna
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.920]   lie and so last week we did the candle thing we bought up the things that we
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.160]   wanted to die do and I wanted to officially say RIP to the old JD and so
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:12.040]   if you would take a moment with me in memory rest in peace to normal guy how
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   smells take that as you want and hello to walking in every day to five
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   different scented candles burning at one time sending my scent of smell into all
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.560]   kinds of confusion different directions guys get ready rest in peace to my one
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:38.080]   favorite pillow that I washed two times in six years and hello to lots and lots
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.440]   and lots and lots of pillows on the couch pillows on the seats pillows on
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:51.000]   the bed pillows everywhere rest in peace to this one hits my house being set to
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.880]   64 degrees paired with a ceiling fan and a side table fan on turbo speed because
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.880]   my wife's always freezing always always and hello to a daily trip to the sauna I
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.560]   didn't know I needed all right it's really good for the toxins it's hot but
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.320]   I start there because I really am kind of like navigating this new me and it's
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.280]   amazing like marriage truly is amazing but I'm figuring out what it looks like
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.560]   to die to my old self and enter into this new relationship with Jenna which
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.680]   is definitely better and I want y'all to hear me say like I am loving marriage
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.520]   but I start there because just like I am transforming and as I've entered into
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.440]   this relationship and a new life is changing in me a lot of us when we get
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.600]   into a relationship with Jesus what we have to know is that when you enter into
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.840]   a relationship with Jesus everything about you should and will begin to
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.320]   change you introduce me to a person who has encountered and sooner the life to
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.480]   Jesus and you are showing me a changed person because when you step into a
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.120]   relationship with Christ the old like we've been saying passes away or you die
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.760]   to your old self and the new you is born the kind of theme verse of this series
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.520]   is 2nd Corinthians 5 17 it's what the series was birthed out of it says
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.360]   therefore if anyone is in Christ he is an old or he's a new creation the old
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.960]   has passed away and behold the new has come the new has come meaning that the
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   invitation is for everyone everyone gets to come to God's family and you get to
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   come exactly as you are no matter what your past present or your future will
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.760]   hold you get to come exactly as you are but hear me you come as you are but you
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.280]   do not stay as you are you get to come as you are but you do not stay as you
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.680]   are because the old you has passed away and the new you is coming it's forming
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.640]   it's changing and it's better it's better if you know what I'm talking
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.760]   about you know that when you go into this new relationship with Jesus
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.560]   everything about you begins to change you begin to talk different you begin to
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.160]   act different hang out different talk different dress different date different
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.480]   you get to spend your time and your money differently you have community and
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.600]   the right people speaking into your life holding you accountable you begin to no
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.480]   longer to want to look at porn or just have casual hookups or get drunk every
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.760]   weekend you actually have the Holy Spirit in you and he starts to convict
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.840]   you and those things aren't as appealing or appetizing and yeah you might can
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.400]   still do it and continue to do it but it's just not hitting like it used to
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.240]   why because you're new because if anyone is in Christ he's a new creation the old
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.360]   has passed away and the new has come those who are in a relationship with
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.200]   Jesus will begin to change and we're gonna see that throughout this entire
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.040]   series what it looks like to change we're gonna focus on different things
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.680]   that we need to say hey RIP to rest in peace to blank because I'm new in Jesus
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.320]   I have a new life with Jesus goodbye the old me hello to the new me in Christ and
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.360]   so tonight the old trait that we're dying to is victim mentality for my
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   note-takers tonight the title of this message is RIP to victim mentality
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.520]   RIP to victim mentality and if you don't know what I'm talking about just a quick
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.840]   easy definition of victim mentality is when someone believes the idea that bad
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.440]   things will always always happen to them or you could include on to that a
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.040]   person with victim mentality is constantly blaming others constantly
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.120]   negative constantly woe is me mentality it's never their own fault I'll always
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.440]   be depressed well I grew up poor or because this happened to me I'm never
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.480]   gonna forgive my dad because he wronged me it's his fault I'm this way
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.080]   everyone's out to get me all I know is broken relationships this is just the
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.840]   way it is and if you let victim mentality rule your life it will
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:23.240]   paralyze you as we'll see tonight victim mentality will paralyze your life it
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.880]   will keep you back but a relationship with Jesus is meant to set you free and
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.040]   some of you tonight might be thinking well that's not me I've never had
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.440]   something crazy happen to me we all we all struggle with a victim mentality
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.500]   whether you realize it or not in some way because we have an enemy because
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.080]   Satan is out there prowling like a lion seeking someone to devour one of his
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.800]   biggest schemes is to convince you that you are a victim that you don't have
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.680]   what it takes that the Holy Spirit isn't enough that you can't defeat that sin
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:03.520]   that you can't make that change that you can't make that move that's how he
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.080]   attacks is treating you like a victim and so tonight we're saying no more
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.420]   we're leaving victim mentality in the past and I want to take a moment just to
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.480]   lean in because I know there is an audience and a specific person in the
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:26.120]   room tonight and you are a victim you actually have been victimized and I want
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.320]   you to hear me as kindly as I can say this I am sorry I'm sorry for whatever
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.360]   happened to you and that person was wrong whatever they did to you was wrong
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.240]   and I hate that because of the brokenness of this world and the
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:48.960]   depravity of man and the sin that is in man's heart we hurt one another and yeah
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:56.720]   you might be walking in here having been victimized but Jesus can rewrite your
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:05.300]   story yes you were a victim but you are not a victim you are a victor if you are
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:12.220]   in Christ I want to even challenge you tonight to begin to not let Satan tell
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.340]   you that what happened to you is who you are I want to begin to challenge you to
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.260]   think hey maybe I'm not a victim but more so because of Jesus I'm a survivor
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.380]   I've prevailed and because of Jesus I don't have to just survive and get by
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.940]   but I can thrive that I can forgive that I can be healed you're gonna see tonight
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:40.780]   that no matter what's happened to you you can be new you can be healed and so
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.860]   whether you face victim mentality whether you have been a victim what
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.020]   we're gonna see tonight is Jesus wants to heal that and so tonight we're gonna
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:56.260]   look at three ways to change your victim mentality to a victor mentality three
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.900]   ways to change your victim mentality to a victor mentality and we're gonna do it
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.540]   by zeroing in on the life of a man that Jesus encountered a paralyzed man and
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:13.380]   we're gonna look at how Jesus took his victim mentality and made him a victor
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.820]   and so if you would open up with me to John chapter 5 John chapter 5 if you
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.860]   don't have your Bibles with you we'll have the verses on the screen here you
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:31.180]   can read along John chapter 5 we're gonna read the whole thing and we're
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:42.140]   gonna break it down y'all ready already all right here we go verse 1 afterward
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.260]   Jesus returned to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish holy days inside the city
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.460]   near the Sheep Gate don't think too deeply about that literally a gate that
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:59.220]   sheep entered was the pool of Bethesda with five covered porches crowds of sick
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.500]   people blind lame or paralyzed lay on the porches one of the men lying there
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.300]   had been sick for 38 years when Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill for a
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:17.500]   long time he asked him would you like to get well I can't sir the sick man said
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.460]   for I have no one to put me in the pool when the water bubbles up what you need
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.380]   to know right there at the time there was like a Greek mythology there was a
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.940]   myth that they believed we know now it was like a natural spring that made the
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.780]   water bubble but they believe that an angel would come down and that they
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.220]   couldn't see and he would like stir the water and like the myth said that if you
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.900]   got in the first one to get in you would be healed so all these sick people would
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.380]   gather around this pool and wait for the bubbles to come up so that's what he's
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.060]   talking about right here no one will put me in the pool when the water bubbles up
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.740]   someone else always gets there ahead of me Jesus told him stand up pick up your
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:02.100]   mat and walk instantly the man was healed he rolled up his sleeping mat and began
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.700]   walking I want to go ahead just stop for a second and look at the first verse and
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:12.500]   just set the scene of how relevant this story is to you and I tonight I mean
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.860]   it's crazy I'm reading this translation and I'm looking and he's literally
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.660]   talking about how in the gates of Jerusalem there was this section where
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.540]   all the sick people the shamed people the diseased people those were that were
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.220]   paralyzed blind deaf if you had something wrong with you this is where
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.540]   you hung out and they all hung out together in a place called the pool of
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.900]   Bethesda Bethesda stay with me is like a Hebrew construct that basically means a
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:43.980]   house of mercy or a house of kindness a house of acceptance and love where all
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:57.820]   the sick people gathered on the porches y'all seeing it I'm like that's us the
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.580]   porch isn't anything special but Jesus is and we're all about Jesus so
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:07.020]   therefore we are wanting to be a house of kindness a house of mercy a house of
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.580]   love and acceptance for any person no matter their sickness no matter the
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.100]   disease no matter what they're walking in with they know they can be safe here
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:21.900]   because look around we're all sick we're all in desperate need of Jesus and we
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.980]   come here because we want him to heal us we come here because we want him to save
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.700]   us to redeem us we come here because we want his mercy and his kindness you and
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:39.220]   I we are the sick this is the pool of Bethesda so this story I mean no matter
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.460]   what you've gone through no matter if you're like man I'm not a victim you're
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:52.780]   sick this story is for you tonight let's continue on so we're gonna see here is
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:58.060]   the first way that we go from a victim mentality to a victim mentality it's in
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:03.820]   verse 3 crowds of sick people blind lame or paralyzed you and I lay on the
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:11.220]   porches one of the men lying there had been sick for 38 years sick and
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:18.900]   paralyzed for 38 years can you imagine I know he struggled with a victim
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.660]   mentality I know I would be and right here when I look at this a victim
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:30.220]   mentality says this is just the way it is 38 years I'm accepting it I'm like
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.180]   I'm paralyzed for the rest of my life this is just the way it is God I don't
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:39.780]   know why me I don't know why not them I don't know I mean but after 38 years I
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:45.180]   can't get in the dang pool everyone's got to go before me no one's for me I
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:51.720]   guess this is just the way it is I know I've been there I think a lot of us have
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:58.380]   been there and a lot of it is on us we self-victimize and we say things like
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.700]   well I guess I'm just gonna have to live with this addiction I guess I'm just
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.620]   gonna live and accept this porn addiction because it's been since eighth
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.940]   grade it's been for years I struggle with this and man I've gone to services
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.460]   like this and I've come down last week and I wrote porn on my card I wrote
[00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.660]   sexual morality on my card and I laid it and the next day I was tempted and I
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.140]   gave in I gave in again and again and again I guess I'm just gonna have to be
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:31.500]   paralyzed and crippled by my addiction I guess this is just the way it is some of
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:37.460]   us are like man where are all the Christian men every guy I date he ends
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:43.140]   up being not it he has no character he ain't about it and we sit there and go
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:48.220]   you know what my dad wasn't even about it so maybe this is what I deserve maybe
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:54.460]   this is who I am maybe I should just settle and lower my standards and just
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.340]   accept I'm never gonna find a Christian man and be unhappily married for the
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:04.820]   rest of my life I guess this is just the way it is some of us I guess I'll just
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:10.180]   keep letting the need for control and the perfect image rule my life and I
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.020]   know on the outside I look good but on the inside I'm spiraling and there's
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.980]   this hamster wheel constantly spinning that's forcing anxiety and stress and
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.060]   worry and I'm spiraling and spiraling and spiraling and I'm trying to hold it
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.880]   all together but I can't and I'm breaking but I guess this is just the
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.980]   way it is I guess stress is just a part of my life I guess worry is just a part
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.340]   of my life and you've just accepted it because you've fallen prey to victim
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:41.180]   mentality a victim mentality says this is just the way it is 38 years 38 years
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:51.740]   of being paralyzed lost hope hopeless accepted I guess I'm just paralyzed this
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:57.380]   is the way it is this is my lot but also there's another group that what has
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.740]   happened to you wasn't self-inflicted that you went through something really
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.700]   hard that was completely out of your control there are some of you here
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.940]   tonight that maybe you were born with an actual disability maybe you were born
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.820]   with an autoimmune system that constantly leaves you tired and fatigued
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:24.020]   and disappointed some of you maybe you have lost a loved one and your
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.140]   circumstance is really really hard you lost your mom to cancer way too soon
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:37.380]   some of you you have been cheated on or your parents did divorce or you saw bad
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:45.700]   relationships or you were abused and hurt but the problem is what victim
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.300]   mentality does what victim mentality will do is it will take that thing that
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:58.340]   is meant to describe your story and tell you it defines you it's meant to describe
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:04.500]   you but victim mentality makes it define you it says yeah this is the way it is
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:10.460]   this is who you are you are what happened to you you will not change you
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:16.740]   should just accept in these moments that were meant to simply describe you I lost
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:22.620]   my mom to cancer someone manipulated me I was born with a disability that's a
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.380]   part of my story not the point of my story it doesn't define me but a victim
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.740]   mentality will tell it that that is what defines you that is who you are and
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:39.820]   that's who you will always be but we know that Jesus is who defines us I know
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.340]   for me there was a time in my life where I fell prey to this kind of victim
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.660]   mentality a thing that described me as I've talked about here many times college
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.620]   boom best friend dad at 45 pastor friend all the things terminal cancer boom 10
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:02.780]   years later life without a dad why God why would you do this are you out to get
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:09.580]   me does the world against me he was a good man he was a preacher for crying
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:14.980]   out loud why him so young so healthy I bet if I had a dad I wouldn't be in such
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.340]   a financial struggle right now in college I bet if I had a dad I wouldn't
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.900]   have to seek affirmation in all the wrong places because my dad would affirm
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.180]   me my dad would compliment like me like he used to I bet if I had a dad then and
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:31.660]   so many of us we walk with life like that if I had this then if it wasn't
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:37.340]   this way then because we took that what was meant to describe us and we're we're
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:44.460]   saying that it defines us and the outcome is victimization but everything
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.380]   changed in my life everything when I learned the truth in this verse right
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.340]   here later on in this book of John in chapter 16 verse 33 it says I have told
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:21:04.820]   you all this so that you may have peace in me here on earth you will have many
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:13.340]   trials and sorrows but take heart because I meaning God I have overcome
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:19.360]   the world when I was walking in a victim mentality I was just stuck on the in the
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.700]   earth I will have many trials and sorrows but then God came into my life
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.460]   and he rewrote my perspective he rewrote my story and the but take heart
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.980]   transitioned me from a victim to a victor because I saw it wasn't up to me
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:38.020]   to overcome my circumstance it was up to God because he tells me he promises me
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.080]   that I don't have to follow my circumstance or pray victim to my
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.380]   circumstance I can have victory over my circumstance because he does and it's
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:51.140]   him who defines me and in that moment in that moment the thing that held me down
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:56.020]   that brought me the most pain God used to transform and it is now the force
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:02.060]   behind my greatest purpose God took what once victimized me and told me you can
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:07.660]   never because it's now what I get to stand up and tell thousands of people
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.820]   about and if you had told that guy who was laying alone on New Year's Eve
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:18.460]   shouting at God drunk in his room on midnight God I hate you I hate you I
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:23.260]   hate you if you would have told me that one day that victim mentality was gonna
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.260]   change to this I would have called you crazy but that's what God does he takes
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:34.260]   what describes you and he points it to himself and he transforms it and he uses
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:41.500]   it to point to his glory to his goodness that's what he does a victim
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.780]   mentality says this is just the way it is but a victim mentality says this may
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:53.140]   be the way it is this may be a part of your story but Jesus can use it Jesus
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:59.420]   wants to use it Jesus wants to use your greatest pain for his glory and purpose
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.980]   if he would let him but you have to take heart you have to make the active choice
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.900]   to go from victim to victor but take heart he has overcome the world he has
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:15.620]   overcome your circumstance everything changed when I began to shift my victim
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.100]   mentality from victim because of my circumstances to victor because of the
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:27.300]   King over my circumstances he did it for me he can do it for you he did it for
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.700]   this man let's keep reading verse 6 when Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.860]   for a long time I don't want to move past that when Jesus saw him and he knew
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:43.220]   he had been ill for a long time this is the heart of your Jesus there was a
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:49.660]   whole crowd in that place many people sick many people struggling this man was
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:55.180]   nothing special to get the attention and catch the eye of Jesus but Jesus saw him
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.300]   even when he wasn't looking for Jesus Jesus was looking for him the same is
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.260]   for you tonight all of these people this is a big place but he's looking at you
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:11.020]   he sees you and just like this man he knows you've been ill for a long time he
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:17.780]   knows you're tired he knows that victim mentality has ruled your life and he
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:23.700]   wants peace to mark your life he looks at him knowing he was ill for a long
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:31.020]   time and he asked him would you like to get well I can't sir this sick man said
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.860]   for I have no one to put me in the pool when the water bubbles up and someone
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.180]   always gets there ahead of me do you see what's happening here his victim
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.140]   mentality is saying what it says to us hey I'm not the problem everyone and
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:48.540]   everything else is y'all know that kind of person I mean it's never me it's
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.500]   always them that person that you come home from work your roommate and they're
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.940]   just always like and then my boss did this and then my boss did this and then
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.900]   they did this and then they did that and then my co-worker if they would just
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:04.940]   show up on time and got it's never them it's exhausting but what's funny about
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:10.500]   this part of this moment is Jesus didn't want his whole life story I mean I bet
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.620]   you I mean Jesus is kind so he's kinder than me I would have been like I didn't
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.780]   ask you about this the pool and all that Jesus asked him a simple yes or no
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.100]   question boy you've been paralyzed for 38 years do you want to be healed or not
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:30.380]   that's what he asked him do you want to be healed and like him I think a lot of
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:37.420]   us but God this but God that but God this yes or no it's like if you had to
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.300]   drink water for a whole day and you're just parched I mean I'm parched right
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:48.260]   now low-key I would take I would take some water not cuz I but actually got
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:56.580]   throw me a water so it's like if this is perfect actually it's like if you hadn't
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.100]   drank and I mean you were just parched and someone's like do you want to drink
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:06.220]   and I'm like well it depends is it Osaka cuz I only drink drink Fiji or I only
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.100]   drink a cincher I don't this I'd be like then you don't get any of my water you're
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:21.020]   ungrateful looking no you take it instantly refreshed because I was so
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:31.300]   dang thirsty yes or no but after 38 years Jesus asked him do you want to be
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:36.900]   healed and instead of giving him an answer like us he gave him an excuse he
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.860]   gave him an excuse a victim mentality is the birthplace of excuses write it down
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.580]   if you are constantly making excuses trace it and see if it's being birthed
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:54.580]   out of a victim mentality see if you are falling prey to victimization here's the
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:27:01.180]   excuse I hear in this man's response to Jesus Jesus I can't because got it
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.740]   yada yada yada I can't Jesus because one I mean I don't know if you know I've
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:10.060]   been here for a long time - every time the water bubbles up no one's gonna pick
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.500]   me up and put me inside well guess what everyone else is sick - they ain't worried
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.420]   about you they're trying to get in and hey no one no one will pick me up every
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.700]   time that they do the person beats me in I'm like dang it I guess I have to wait
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.420]   till next time so then I'm waiting and I'm waiting and I'm waiting I'm so tired
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.900]   of waiting instead of giving me an answer he gives him an excuse and God is
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:38.260]   calling some of us tonight he's asking you do you want to be healed do you want
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:44.180]   to be free do you want to be changed and God's asking you to step out in radical
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.260]   faith or to give up something or to surrender something or to make a change
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.180]   make that move or to break up with that person or to join that church and your
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:03.660]   response is Jesus I can't because I'm too busy Jesus I can't because if he if
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.420]   I break up with him then who am I gonna have Jesus I can't make that move I
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:17.100]   don't know anyone I don't know anyone there and instead of saying yes he gives
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:23.900]   an excuse we give an excuse but what's so funny about this excuse is it's
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.060]   actually correct when you think about it hey do you want to be healed what's he
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:38.340]   say I can't bingo you got one thing right you can't you and I we cannot heal
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:44.140]   ourselves we're not capable we need Jesus we need Jesus and a victim
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:49.860]   mentality will tell you I can't but a victim mentality says but he can he can
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:55.740]   he can break every chain he can provide peace in the midst of hard circumstances
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.720]   he can rewrite that really hard thing that worked that happened to you he can
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:11.700]   you can't but he can but apart from him you're right you can't John 15 5 actually
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.180]   proves this when Jesus says I am the vine you are the branches those who
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:22.400]   remain in me and I in them will produce much fruit but apart from me you can do
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:30.180]   nothing you can't but then Matthew 19 26 says Jesus looked at them intently and
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:37.100]   he said humanly speaking left to yourself it is impossible but with God
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.780]   everything is impossible or everything is possible
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:56.260]   left to yourself you can do nothing but with God anything is possible your
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.220]   response to God says a lot about your view of him how you respond to him says
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:06.260]   a lot about how you view him when he calls you out when he calls you up when
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:12.060]   he calls you to be healed and made new how you respond says a lot about how you
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:16.820]   view him if you're afraid that he's gonna abandon you you'll show that in
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.980]   your response if you're afraid that he's gonna hurt you or bait-and-switch or not
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.260]   be good like he promises you'll show that in your response your response to
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.700]   God says a lot about how you viewed it you view him because can you imagine
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:37.220]   this man clearly didn't know who he was talking to you can see it in his response
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.900]   he had a wrong view of Jesus because when Jesus asked you like he's asking
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.260]   some of you tonight do you want to be healed your answer every time should be
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.540]   yes because I can't I've tried everything I thought the pool I thought
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.900]   the people I thought someone picking me up I thought all these different things
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.660]   was the solution to my problem but I can't I've run out of options you
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.940]   searched at the end of a bottle you search in a relationship you searched in
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.740]   success in self-help books and you can't seem to figure out the solution to your
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.700]   problem it's because it's standing right in front of you it only comes from one
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.380]   source and his name is Jesus his name is Jesus Christ and he's asking you tonight
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.620]   do you want to be healed and instead of giving him the answer yes I'm in you're
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:25.820]   bringing him excuses you don't actually want it I think you want to complain I
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.940]   think you want to talk about it but you don't want to be about it because I'm
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.540]   looking at your response to him and your response to him when he actually calls
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:42.620]   you to do something doesn't match what you say why because we want to be healed
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:49.340]   but we don't want to change we want God to bless us but we don't want to change
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:55.740]   we want God to restore us but we don't want to make moves so many of us claim
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.620]   to want to be healed but we don't want to change and that looks like this God
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:06.660]   I'm so tired of being in debt God okay stop spending start saving stop going
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.860]   out to eat oh and give generously and trust me with that and don't even look
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.500]   at them Golden Goose girls but God I want to be out of debt keep spending
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:22.380]   keep going out keep getting that other drink God would you bring me a spouse I'm
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.460]   sick and tired of being single okay you want a godly man start being a godly
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:39.700]   person start changing start changing who you are get up get with me God I'm so
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.580]   misunderstood I heard that one I know I said that one no one gets me hugs
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:51.060]   exhausting okay well tell them that trust people and let them in you want me
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:59.220]   to what God I hate my job give me a promotion bless me bring me prosperity
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:04.860]   and riches okay well you can start by at least showing up on time like and fix
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:13.660]   your hair God do something through me like you are clearly doing through them
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.100]   all right well how about you start just being with me read your Bible and pray
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:22.340]   every day before I do a work through you I want to be with you but you got to
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.780]   make some changes so many of us complain I want to be healed you come to the
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.400]   porch time and time again because I want to see change I'm so exhausted I'm so
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.960]   tired yet you walk out of here the same and I want to be clear about something
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:41.700]   you don't change to earn your salvation there is always a seat at the table of
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.260]   God and he is constantly inviting every single person here tonight to come and
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:50.140]   enjoy the feast with the family of God but he is not gonna pick you up and put
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.780]   you on your chair he wants you to pull up the chair and sit down and feast why
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.500]   because that's real love anything else would be forced on you it would be a
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.780]   robot it wouldn't be a relationship you got to get up pull up the chair and sit
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:11.660]   and dine with the family of God but so many of us like this man yeah I want to
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.020]   be healed I mean it shows me like if he's by the pool that's supposed to heal
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.980]   people if he's wanting people to pick him up and put him in every time it
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.980]   bubbles he's saying he wants to be healed but why is he still there after
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:27.560]   38 years I mean come on surely he could scoot or something he doesn't want to be
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:34.220]   healed so many of us we claim to want to be healed but if you want to be healed
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:41.780]   you got to be willing to change changing requires rearranging getting up making
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:48.100]   moves getting in the word getting in prayer getting with community you got to
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:53.180]   rechange the things in your life the old you has to pass away the new life in
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:58.180]   Christ has to be evident has to come a victim mentality will tell you that
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.540]   everyone else and everything else is the problem but you but a victor mentality
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:08.540]   says because Jesus is the solution to my problem I can face whatever lies ahead
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:15.140]   because Jesus is the solution to my problem I can face whatever lies ahead
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.500]   but the best part of this story as we're going to wrap up the best part of this
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.860]   story is that thankfully Jesus does not meet need this man to view him or
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:31.140]   respond to him rightly for Jesus to respond to him Jesus's response to him
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.100]   is not dictated on his response to Jesus because he says I can't yada yada yada
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.580]   and Jesus could have been like you know what I'm out on this no what's he do
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:49.020]   what does he say Jesus told him in verse 8 stand up pick up your mat and walk and
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:55.820]   instantly the man was healed he rolled up his sleeping mat and he began walking
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:01.380]   your victim mentality will say to you God can use anyone but me but I see
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.200]   right here that's not true if God can pick this random man who have been
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.820]   paralyzed and in a victim mentality state for 38 years what makes you think
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:14.580]   that he can't use you he's calling this man to stand up pick up his mat and go
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.140]   and to be free and he's calling you to do the same tonight but victim mentality
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.960]   is telling you that God could do that with anyone else but me man if you JD if
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.420]   you knew what I'd done hey if you knew what I'd done you wouldn't put me here
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:34.380]   but God changed my life he placed me here he picked me up he told me to stand
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:41.700]   up pick up my mat and go and some of you God calls you out and you're like yeah
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.020]   he's like do you want to be healed you say all these things you know yeah I
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:50.620]   want to be healed but he calls you to stand up and you're like wait what no no
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:54.220]   no God you can use anyone but but not me I'm I'm actually kind of comfortable
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:37:01.620]   here I'm kind of comfortable here and I want you to notice something Jesus says
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:07.420]   stand up pick up your mat why would Jesus tell him to pick up his mat people
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.340]   who were paralyzed had these mats that this is referring to he had no more he
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.940]   had no more use for it he didn't need a mat so why after 38 years of being
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.660]   paralyzed you would think that Jesus would say hey yeah forget about that
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.420]   leave it behind why did he tell him to pick up his mat and walk well later in
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.500]   this story we don't have time to read it but later in the story you're gonna see
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.460]   if you keep on reading I would encourage you all to go read it later there's this
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.900]   moment where this man is walking he's carrying his mat you know and he's like
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.020]   he's feeling himself you know he's free now his legs that all this super strength
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.740]   I can't imagine what it's like to be healed by Jesus like that so he's
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.940]   walking and these religious leaders known as the known as the Pharisees they
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.420]   come forth in like a Pharisee like you read time and time again boy they get on
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:54.140]   my nerves they say this guy was 38 years paralyzed and now he's walking and
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.500]   they're not like whoa my guy you're walking what do they say if you read it
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:04.540]   they just say hey why are you carrying your mat on the Sabbath the Sabbath of
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:09.940]   this time was a religious day of the week where in Jewish culture you could
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:16.740]   not work you could not lift anything clearly in the name of praising God but
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.400]   the Pharisees made it about religion and not relationship the Sabbath was
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.100]   intended to be more intimate with God but they made it about works about
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.020]   religion and so they condemned this guy and they shamed this guy they say why
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:33.140]   why are you carrying your mat on the Sabbath and in that moment if this man
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.400]   was living in a victim mentality going you're right God can't use me you're
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.660]   right I'll just go back I'll go back to my my old paralyzed self you're right
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.980]   this is more comfortable anyways this is who I've always been you're right
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:39:03.780]   I'm like well what do you want me to do like no listen victim mentality would
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.380]   have brought him back to the mat and said you're right let me drop it but
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:14.220]   Jesus said stand up pick up your mat and walk so that's what he did why because
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.820]   his life had been changed by Jesus he looked at the Pharisees and his response
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:24.420]   his response is not shame his response is not guilt or hiding no he says the
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:30.380]   man named Jesus who healed me told me to do this so I did and I don't really care
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.180]   what you have to say you might want to victimize me you want I might want to
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.460]   remind me of who I am but guess what I don't really care because the man who
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.780]   healed me changed my life and he told me to pick up my mat and walk the mat was
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:49.500]   once a reminder of his paralysis but now this mat is a reminder of God's
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.460]   goodness of God's transformation in his life he carries his mat to point people
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:40:00.120]   to his Savior and Jesus is asking you tonight to stand up be healed quit
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.620]   living in a victim mentality and to pick up your mat I don't know what your mat
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:09.300]   is but he's saying stand up pick up that addiction that you once were a slave to
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.460]   and go help other people be set free like you have stand up pick up that
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.740]   abuse and go help other abuse victims pick up your mat so when people walk by
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.300]   and go hey why are you carrying that why are you why are you talking about your
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.100]   sin that way why are you talking about these hard things that you've been
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.660]   through why are you so free why are you so joyful you say hey hey this mat is
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.620]   simply to start this conversation so I can tell you the reason why I could pick
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:37.320]   up this mat is not to say look at the mat but look at my Savior look at my
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.580]   healer look at my provider he changed everything I once was a lame man man I
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:47.580]   was laying here for 38 years I thought that was my life I was a victim to
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:53.500]   paralysis but because of Jesus I am Victor I have victory because Jesus the
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:59.040]   ultimate victory healed my life he changed my life and he did it for him he
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:05.700]   can do it for you a victim mentality says God can use anyone but me but a
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:15.380]   victim mentality says God can use anyone even me aka won't he do it he will he
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:23.020]   will he's calling you tonight to rise up take up your mat and walk he wants to
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.860]   heal you and he's asking you do you want to be healed and you have an
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.960]   opportunity tonight to respond or you can make an excuse and you can fall
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:41.040]   prey to victim mentality or you can say yes that's all it takes trust surrender
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:50.280]   and if you say yes if you're willing to go yes I'll listen and when Jesus says
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.320]   hey stand up take up your mat and walk be changed therefore if anyone is in
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.480]   Christ he is a new creation the old passes away behold the new has come and
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.400]   if you will stand up and pick up your mat and walk watch what he'll do watch
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.760]   what he'll do with that step of going I don't want to be a victim anymore I
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:16.120]   don't want to be a slave to my past I don't want to be prey to my
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:21.840]   circumstances I'm gonna live in the freedom that the victory of the blood of
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:29.400]   Jesus offers and he's saying good then stand up pick up your mat and walk and
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.440]   so before I ask you to do that I want to pick up my mat and I want to show you
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:39.240]   and tell you about a part of my story that held me down for so long it was
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:45.160]   sixth grade fifth grade going into sixth grade I was at a church event and we
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.680]   were playing some game as late at night and I was sexually abused by a guy in
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:54.560]   high school and after the encounter I was nervous and I pulled away and it was
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.440]   weird and he said hey do not tell anyone they'll think that you're weird they'll
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.240]   think that you're gay they will shame you don't think you're disgusting your
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.520]   parents will be so mad at you do not tell anyone right after that you know
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.920]   what happened I was bullied significantly bullied for liking clothes
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.020]   in a country town for liking to sing for liking to dance I was told hey you're
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.920]   gay you're all these different things then after that I was introduced to
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:26.720]   masturbation and pornography by a guy my age boom boom boom and I hit it being a
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:32.120]   pastor's kid in a small town I didn't believe that I was able to get up and
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:40.580]   take up my math if anyone knew if anyone knew what would my dad say what would my
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:46.760]   mom say what would people say everything everything will be ruined I will never
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:50.280]   come back from this and that's what victim mentality told me that God can
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:44:01.040]   use anyone but me until one day my freshman year of college I've been in
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.360]   spaces like this all my life but for whatever reason on that day out of the
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:13.840]   crowd like this Jesus chose me and he said hey do you want to be healed do you
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:19.600]   want to rise up and take up that mat of abuse and help people be set free and I
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:28.040]   was afraid but I said yes I said yes and I stood up and I picked up that mat and
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:33.120]   I began to tell one and then two and then groups and guess what guess how
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.600]   many people said me too me too me too and the thing that defined me for so
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.120]   long it went from defining me to simply describing me it was no longer the
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.160]   points of my life but just simply a part of my life that God used and he is using
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   to not only heal me but to heal others because he he is where ultimate victory
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:00.800]   is found and the day that I said yes to him everything changed and he did it for
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:07.000]   me he can do it for you he did it for this man and he wants to do it for you
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.400]   he's asking you tonight do you want to be healed and your response is to say
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:20.920]   yes and he'll say to you then rise up pick up your mat no longer a victim but
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.440]   a victor because of what I have done on the cross because I have claimed victory
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   over your sin and the abuse and the porn and the hookups and the drugs and the
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.040]   pride because I have claimed victory over that by defeating sin and rising
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.880]   from the grave you don't have to be a victim RIP to victim mentality and say
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:51.840]   yes to victory in Jesus and only Jesus if you want to be healed tonight rise up
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.160]   take up your mat and follow him let's pray
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   God thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for rewriting stories for taking messy past
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:18.240]   and awful stories and circumstances and sins and secrets and covering them with
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:25.880]   your blood so that we can be new for the person tonight like I was who believed
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:32.200]   for so long that this is just the way it is this is who you are and no one can
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:39.240]   ever know and because of this God can use them but he can't use you for the
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:45.080]   person who is believing that lie fed from victim mentality would you break it
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:51.480]   tonight in Jesus name with the cross of Jesus Christ with the empty tomb rewrite
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:57.800]   their story but tonight be the night that they say yes and when they rise up
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.600]   take up that mat and make that courageous step to follow you would you
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:06.320]   give them the strength would they know right now that out of this crowd you see
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.160]   them you see them and you're asking them do you want to be healed and would you
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:20.580]   give them the strength to say yes not because I can but because he can because
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:27.160]   of you Jesus you make all things new maybe worship and live like that so your
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.480]   name that I pray amen
